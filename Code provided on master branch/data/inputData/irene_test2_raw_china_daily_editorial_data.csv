 ""We're advancing the interests of the free world, and we've made great progress,"" is how US Vice-President Mike Pence summed up the US administration's stance and his presence at the Munich Security Conference. 
Had he taken into consideration the feelings of his audience, he would have shown a little modesty. Since it seemed that most of those listening felt differently. 
No. We are not talking about the silence following his announcement that he brought greetings direct from the White House. Although, this has been taken to sensational levels in less-than-friendly media presentations. 
Or the lengthy applause German Chancellor Angela Merkel drew following her defense of the European approach to international affairs, which is in sharp contrast to that of the United States. 
Or the standing ovation Pence's predecessor, Joe Biden, won upon declaring ""America will be back"". Even though we never saw the US leave. Perhaps Biden was hinting at some future scenario. Although we didn't hear him say that. 
So we need help to see the ""great progress"" the US vice-president boasted of. Because what the rest of world saw from the Munich gathering was further evidence that there is a huge divergence between Washington and its traditional European allies, on almost all outstanding concerns on their respective foreign policy agendas. 
While it may be an exaggeration to conclude that Pence deepened the divisions. He did highlight the widening gap between the once very close allies. From the Iran nuclear deal to Russia, Venezuela, and Syria, the current US administration is at loggerheads with its European allies. Fundamentally, they are at odds on how international affairs should be approached. 
As was evident in Munich, their disparities extend beyond approaches to values. That Pence called for Europe to scrap the Iran nuclear deal and Merkel gave a determined defense of it, served as vivid illustration of the divide in diplomatic philosophies between Europe and the US under the current US administration. Merkel advocated continuous commitment to multilateral approaches. Pence made clear Washington was not going to reconsider its insistence on US interests coming first and foremost and the devil take everyone else. 
Merkel's appeal for the US to ""put yourself in the other's shoes … and see whether we can get win-win solutions together,"" therefore, will in all likelihood have fallen on deaf ears. 
Despite Biden's observation that ""leadership only exists if somebody and others are with you"". 
The White House probably doesn't care about the Pew Research Center survey that found an increasing number of Europeans, half the population in Germany and France, see US power as a threat. 
But as the rest of the world demonstrates a growing willingness to show it a cold shoulder, the US may find that it is the one that's hindmost.

 It seems to be contagious — no sooner does one Western politician engage in some character assassination of China than another pops up to do the same. 
The latest verbal bullets have been fired by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison who alleged on Monday that a ""sophisticated state actor"" was behind a cyberattack on the Australian Parliament's computing network. 
Although he did not name it, it has been assumed that he was insinuating China was responsible, given this is not the first time that Canberra's anxiety-driven willingness to emulate Washington has prompted it to lay the responsibility for alleged spying at Beijing's door. 
The prime minister also claimed that the network used by major political parties was subject to what he described as a ""malicious intrusion"" on Feb 8. 
No matter whether he was assigning the malevolent acts to China or another country, it is irresponsible of him to cast aspersions in this way. 
The world we are living in seems engulfed by conspiracy theories. And clearly some politicians, even some political leaders, are not averse to fueling them, even starting them. 
Do they delight in the assumption that some powerful forces are perniciously working behind the scenes to curry favor with a credulous public, to cover up their own failings, or because they think they can leverage some tangible national advantage from it? 
Whatever the reason, such ploys are an easy option as their perpetrators do not need any evidence to support the accusations. They simply voice their scurrilous claims, confident that their invective will stick in some impressionable minds. 
Certainly it seems that when it comes to China, many Western politicians, have forgotten their professional ethics, as they appear to have no compunction about letting their tongues wag maliciously about a sovereign nation and its companies. 
It is hard not to view the calumny as orchestrated. Western politicians seem willing to speak ill of China because they feel their countries are being elbowed aside as it rises. Even though China has never exerted any force to make room for itself and has invited them to accompany it on its journey of rejuvenation. 
It is natural for people to feel anxious about changing circumstances over which they feel they have no control. But these conspiracy theories that portray China as aggressively seeking to infiltrate Western networks and societies hark back to the comic books of the 1950s and they are as far-fetched now as they were back then.

"Hounding of Huawei a lowdown dirty trick: China Daily editorial","

 In a slap in the face for the United States, which is seeking a blanket ban by European countries on equipment provided by the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, the British intelligence service has determined that using Huawei equipment does not pose a security threat. 
Any possible risks arising from using Huawei technologies in 5G networks can be mitigated, according to a Financial Times report citing two sources familiar with the conclusion of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre. 
In addition, the NCSC has never found evidence of malicious Chinese state cyber activity through Huawei despite repeated US accusations to that effect. 
It is encouraging to hear some reason amid the jibber-jabber of US fearmongering. At the Munich Security Conference, US Vice-President Mike Pence on Saturday once again spuriously urged US allies to take seriously ""the threat"" posed by Huawei and other Chinese telecoms companies and exclude them from their markets. 
But even if is repeated a thousand times or more, a lie will remain a lie. Indeed, more countries have come to realize that the US assertions that Chinese 5G network technology presents unacceptable security risks are pure nonsense, and the US targeting Huawei has nothing to do with security concerns, but because it finds it hard to come to terms with China becoming a global tech power. 
The White House released its mission statement in October last year, declaring ""America will win the global race to 5G"". And it is clear that it is prepared to go to any lengths to force others off the track so it can reach the finishing line first. 
Huawei is leading the development of 5G, while US companies are lagging behind in the competition. Huawei not only offers superior hardware, but also at lower price, which explains why it has shipped more than 10,000 5G base stations worldwide — and why it has become the target for Washington's dirty tricks. 
With customers in 170 countries and regions, telecoms network operators worldwide have every reason to worry that excluding Huawei from market competition will disrupt the supply of equipment, increase costs to carriers and customers, and delay the rollout of next-generation 5G services. 
That's why the GSM Association, which represents the interests of mobile network operators around the world, has called on European governments to join its members in establishing a testing regime to find out for themselves if Huawei poses any security threat, rather than be duped into joining the Washington-orchestrated hounding of Huawei. 
The latest message from Britain's cyber security center should encourage European governments and mobile operators to base their decisions related to Huawei on technical expertise and evidence-based appraisal of risk, instead of ideological mania.

 As one of the strategic city clusters — along with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development and the Yangtze River Economic Belt — that are intended to act as engines for the national economy and facilitate the nation's further opening-up, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a key component of the national development strategy for the next 30 years or so. 
According to the outline of the development blueprint for the Greater Bay Area released on Monday, the main focus is to strengthen the cooperation among the three areas in order to turn the Greater Bay Area into a world-class innovation and technology hub and an efficient gateway between the mainland and the outside world, particularly those economies involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. 
Encompassing nine cities in Guangdong province — Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen — along with the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, which have different political, legal, economic and customs systems, the plan calls for close cooperation and coordination to harness the collective strengths of the region, which is already the most prosperous and internationalized region in the country. 
Rather than weakening the application of ""one country, two systems"" as some pundits have suggested, the outline of the development plan shows that the intention is to take advantage of these differences to boost the development of the bay area as whole. 
Thus the plan aims to strengthen Guangdong's position as the nation's leading technology and industrial innovation center and reinforce its role as a pilot zone for reform and opening-up. And it seeks to not only consolidate Hong Kong's role as an offshore renminbi business hub and international financial center, but also to take advantage of its mature legal system to establish the SAR as legal and dispute resolution center for the Asia-Pacific. Macao is to likewise leverage its comparative advantage as an economic and trade cooperation platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as advancing its reputation as a global tourism and leisure center. 
Now that the blueprint has provided the overall direction for coordinated development, all the cities, each of which has its unique role to play, should come up with their respective plans to work within the framework so as to achieve the goal of building a vibrant and innovative world-class bay area by 2022. 
By fully leveraging their comparative advantages and enhancing the convergence and coordination of their policy and planning, the 11 cities can make the Greater Bay Area an even more dynamic region than it is now and a showcase for the nation's continuing reform and opening-up.

 When German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, ""the question now is: do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?"" she was denouncing the unilateralism the United States has been pursuing since 2016. 
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, she called on the United States to put itself in other countries' shoes and to pursue win-win solutions together. 
That the warm applause she received was absent after the address by US Vice-President Mike Pence speaks volumes about how unwelcome the unilateralist policies the US has adopted are. 
The US has withdrawn from the multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, announced it is quitting the Paris Agreement on climate change and repeatedly pointed accusing fingers at China, even its own allies, on anything it considers to be not in its own favor. 
The US administration refers to the unilateral and isolationist policies it is pursuing with the euphemism ""America First"", and Pence tried to claim that ""does not mean America alone"". But the US is becoming increasingly isolated as it stands against the trend for cooperation in pursuit of shared peace and prosperity. 
Instead of solving the common problems the world is facing, the US is standing on the wrong side of history trying to dictate to other countries in a hegemonic manner what they should do. 
It seems as if it believes it is the very source of justice and fairness and thus entitled to lead the world in whatever manner it pleases. It is with this mentality that it wields the baton of sanctions against any country that it considers to be defying its will, or raises tariffs on imports from any country when it feels it is losing the trade competition with that country. 
Wherever the US exerts its unilateral policies in the world, the situation is sure to become chaotic. 
The situation in the Middle East has become much more volatile and complicated since the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. 
It is increasing its pressure on the European Union to cut off its relations with Russia, which if the EU does, will increase the uncertainties and pose a threat to the stability of Europe. 
Meanwhile the trade frictions it has instigated with China have seriously affected the development of the global economy. Its persistent persuasion of its allies not to use the equipment and services of China's telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for their 5G networks not only blocks the development of this world telecoms equipment maker. It will also have a negative impact on the development of the next generation telecoms network worldwide as the entire supply chain in this sector will be jeopardized. 
Given the uncertainties the world faces, just as Chinese top diplomat Yang Jiechi said at the conference, the world needs multilateralism and cooperation more than at any other time. The world will only have more problems if unilateralism is not contained.

"Zara 'insulting China'? Don't be so sensitive!","

 The costume and cosmetics brand Zara was recently in trouble because one of its advertisements, in which a female Chinese model appeared, was blamed for ""defaming the Chinese"". 
The troublemaking advertisement was released on Friday on Zara's official website. Titled ""Beauty is here"", it stars a Chinese woman wearing the brand's clothes and aims to introduce new cosmetics. 
Yet, after Zara shared it on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, in some of the comments it was noted that the model had freckles on her face, suggesting that by selecting her as the model, Zara might mean to ""defame the Chinese"", because a perfect face should be without any freckles. Some also added that the model in the photo didn't appear to be in a good, energetic mood. 
""Does Zara mean all Asian girls have freckles on their faces?"" Went one of the hottest comments on the Zara release. 
""Cannot believe they pick a freckled face on behalf of Asian females,"" said another. Some of the comments, deleted very soon after being posted, even guessed Zara might mean to ""insult"" China, as the Italian brand D&G did in November. 
Yet the majority of the comments said they don't think Zara means any harm. ""It is OK for anyone to have a freckled face, so why cannot a model?"" was another one of the hottest comments. 
On Saturday, Zara responded that it meant no harm. The company said photos of the model were taken in an all-natural way without any software manipulation, and the reactions might just be differences in aesthetics. 
By Sunday evening, the hashtag #Zara responds about the Chinese model advertisement# had already been read 460 million times on Sina Weibo, making it one of the hottest of the day. 
It might be understandable that those who complain about Zara's new advertisement might do so to prevent the nation's image from being hurt. However, their deeds show over-sensitivity and a lack of cultural confidence. It shows they are so afraid of being hurt that they tend to take a defense gesture against any move they do not understand. 
Cultural confidence is just being promoted by the leadership of this country, and tolerance is an essential part of it. Only when we learn to tolerate each other in terms of aesthetic, will cultural confidence be owned by everyone. 
Besides, the model in the incident, Li Jingwen, is famous, having worked professionally for a long time. To those who are unsatisfied with her freckled face, that might be hurtful to her, too, although they might not mean any harm. Let's hope tolerance can be promoted so that similar misunderstandings do not happen again.

"UK's gunboat policy will likely sink its trade hopes: China Daily editorial","

 The incumbents of Downing Street and the United Kingdom Treasury are reportedly tearing their hair out at the injudicious words of the UK secretary of state for defense who has ruined a crucial trip by the chancellor of the exchequer to Beijing. 
A trip considered ""a vital part"" of the United Kingdom's endeavors to cement global trading links as it struggles to bring home the bacon after Brexit. A trip that British media claim would be worth 10.2 billion pounds ($7.88 billion) over a five-year period. 
The British Treasury has confirmed Philip Hammond, its chancellor, will not travel to Beijing, but it has sought to downplay the incident claiming ""No trip was ever announced or confirmed"". 
Nonetheless preparations for that unannounced, unconfirmed visit were reportedly ""well advanced"". Until that is, British Secretary of State for Defense Gavin Williamson torpedoed it with his remarks in London on Feb 11. 
In a speech titled ""Defense in Global Britain"" outlining the British military's future direction, Williamson announced he would dispatch the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific and that Britain was prepared to use ""lethal"" force to deter countries that ""flout international law"". That rhetoric was broadly read as a less-than-subtle threat to China in the South China Sea, given it echoed that of the United States when referring to its naval operations in those waters. 
It should come as no surprise then that Beijing would have second thoughts about committing to any trade engagement. 
London has obviously realized the damaging potential of Williamson's remarks. Downing Street distanced itself from the statements, saying Britain has ""a strong and constructive relationship"" with China. 
George Osborne, the former British Tory chancellor, is surely not alone in finding the British government's China policy baffling. 
""You have got the defense secretary engaging in gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind at the same time as the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary are going around saying they want a close economic partnership with China,"" he told BBC Radio 4. 
But of course the UK also wants a close economic partnership with the US and having spent 3.1 billion pounds on the warship, it needs to give it a purpose beyond the jingoistic nostalgia for a time when Britannia ruled the waves. 
British officials were said to be in a ""frantic round of diplomacy"" to try to get talks back on track. But it will not be easy if its defense department insists on living in the past. 
If Whitehall is determined to confront Beijing, it should not expect to profit from a warm relationship.

 Related: 
President Xi meets US trade representative, treasury secretaryIn welcome news, it seems that the latest talks between China and the United States, which concluded on Friday, have further narrowed their differences and expanded their common ground on key trade and economic issues. 
The two sides entered the two days of high-level talks on Thursday amid a flurry of positive signals that progress was being made. And it seems that their candid discussions have continued to be rewarded. 
There has clearly been movement on a number of topics that have been the focus of their recent trade rows. Speaking to President Xi Jinping after the talks wrapped up, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the negotiators “feel we have made headway on very, very important and difficult issues”. 
It is probably still too early to conclude that this heralds an end to the long-running trade dispute between the two countries, and it would be rash to be overly sanguine about the prospects for relations given Washington’s anxieties about China’s rise, which may simply be channeled in other ways. But the agreement between Xi and his US counterpart Donald Trump in December to press the pause button on frictions, and the subsequent intense series of discussions to find ways to stop them escalating, show both sides are aware of how damaging and potentially dangerous it would be to keep locking horns over their trade relations. 
Hopefully, the discussions over the past three months have helped both sides to better understand each other’s concerns and fostered greater mutual trust. 
That the feel-good atmosphere that has prevailed since the January discussions in Washington has been maintained by this round of talks was evident as the negotiations are to continue in the US capital next week. This welcome development was confirmed by Xi, who said he hoped the discussions would carry forward the positive momentum as it conformed to the interests of both countries to strengthen their cooperation. 
Although it is probably too hasty to interpret from this that a deal is imminent given some of the US demands, it is to be hoped that the just-concluded negotiations have laid the groundwork for next week’s discussions to establish a framework for a resolution to the trade dispute, so that a meeting between Xi and Trump, which is regarded as necessary to finalize any deal, can be scheduled for this purpose as soon as possible. 
New progress on the outstanding difficult issues is imperative as the trade frictions have not been good for either country, despite claims to the contrary. 
The tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US so far have had a negative impact on the Chinese economy, but it has shown resilience in coping with the shocks, and the repercussions have not been as severe as predicted. In January, for instance, Chinese exports rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 3.5 percent decline in December, according to customs data released on Thursday. And although its export growth to the US continued to drop, no doubt due to the raised tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s shipments to other major markets, such as the European Union, Japan and Southeast Asia, all rose strongly. 
Meanwhile, despite assertions otherwise, the US economy has not remained unscathed, as shown by the need to offer emergency assistance to its farmers and the voices of complaint from US companies urging the administration to change tack. 
Cooperation based on fully respecting mutual interests is the best way for the two countries to renew their trade and economic relations with a deal that is in line with the interests of both countries. If that has been the shared understanding during this week’s talks, and it is carried forward in the negotiations in Washington next week, hopefully the two sides will be able to narrow the differences between them sufficiently so that the two leaders can pencil in a date for a meeting at which they can shake hands on a deal that sets the right course for future relations.

"Washington's Huawei anxiety has become hysteria: China Daily editorial","

 Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies has been in hot water lately. 
And the water keeps getting hotter as Washington continues to fan the flames of hysteria over it being a security threat. Hard on the heels of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Monday warned allies that embracing Huawei technologies may jeopardize their partnerships with Washington, US Vice-President Mike Pence praised Poland on Wednesday, for ""protecting the telecoms sector from China"". 
No telecoms operators in any country using Huawei equipment have reported security breaches. Even the White House, which has been fanatically trying to brand Huawei as a ""China threat"", has produced no evidence of the company's alleged involvement in spying. 
While there is no hard truth to underpin it, the ongoing witch-hunt, which Washington is enthusiastically directing and tirelessly broadening, certainly means nothing. It betrays growing anxiety over, helplessness about, and inability to adapt to the new reality that the present-day world is increasingly turning from unipolar to multipolar. 
Despite Beijing's persistent pledge that it wants to forge a constructive relationship with Washington, the latter has remained at best lukewarm, preferring instead to cling to its idée fixe that security will be out of the question if it is not the world's sole superpower. 
So an anxious White House chooses to confront China ""on every front"". And it is matching that rhetoric with forceful actions. 
Despite all the suspicion and suppression, the besieged Huawei has continually highlighted its willingness to accept security scrutiny. Which it believes is the only way to prove its innocence. But innocence hardly matters to the Washington fearmongers. They have become hysteria. 
In the latest symptom of their distress, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, contending for a contract from the Washington, D.C. Metro, is labeled a potential source of ""cyber security risks"". Four Democratic senators have reportedly expressed concern that video surveillance cameras and the automated aspects of railway cars may be the tools of spies or hackers. 
Following that logic, literally everything electronic produced by China can be turned into surveillance devices and be exploited by the Chinese government — lighting, signs, TVs, microwaves, fridges, even toys. 
At the end of the day, they imply, can you lie on a made-in-China mattress without worrying you are being eavesdropped by some ears across the Pacific? 
James Groft, chief executive of James Valley Telecommunications, who told The Wall Street Journal he hasn't seen Huawei do anything wrong, said he needs ""something credible, and not fearmongering"". Because he knows the hysteria will only end up hurting his US clients. 
But that is unlikely to be forthcoming. In an article for the Financial Times, Robert Hannigan, the former head of UK's GCHQ intelligence arm, said its National Cyber Security Centre, has been evaluating Huawei's presence in UK telecom networks for some years, and it has never found any evidence of malicious Chinese state cyber activity through the company.

   New round of China-US trade talks starts in Beijing on Feb 14, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua] 
 Amid a good fall of snow, which Chinese traditionally believe promises a year of harvest and prosperity, Chinese and United States top officials started two days of talks in Beijing on Thursday. 
It is encouraging that after the deputy-level meetings on Monday and Tuesday to work out the technical details for an agreement — including a mechanism for enforcing any deal — the face-to-face discussions being conducted between decision-makers from both countries are being held amid a general air of optimism. 
The negotiations are being led by Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose cordial discussions in Washington on Jan 30 and 31 raised hopes that the two sides are genuinely doing their utmost to reach an agreement ahead of the March 1 deadline when US tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. 
But there are still obstacles to be overcome, and no one should underestimate how daunting a task the two sides face trying to resolve all the differences that have long existed between them in one clean sweep. 
Which is why US President Donald Trump’s latest remarks — that the negotiations have been progressing “very well” and he might reportedly even let the March 1 deadline “slide for a little while” — have been taken as portents that progress is being made and a positive result may well be on the way. 
Especially as White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has raised the possibility of Trump meeting with President Xi Jinping at the US president's personal retreat at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, sometime in March — The White House has previously said the two leaders would have to meet to strike the final bargain. 
The market never lies, as the saying goes. Let’s hope that’s true, because the stock market has already cast a vote of confidence in China and the US being able to reach a deal. The bench mark Shanghai Composite Index has rebounded more than 10 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average, more than 15 percent, from their lows in December when Sino-US trade tensions were running high. 
It is apt that melting snow symbolizes a new beginning, as positive progress in the talks would mean a convergence of expectations for bilateral relations and help ensure the Sino-US relationship has a solid foundation of mutual trust and good momentum for positive interaction at the start of its fifth decade.

"Warsaw conference an exercise in futility: China Daily editorial","

 The two-day Middle East conference that started in Poland's capital Warsaw on Wednesday proclaims it will help promote peace and stability in the region. But it is sailing against the wind if it wants to yield any substantial result. There will likely be ""all thunder and no rain"" — as the Chinese saying goes — given the deep divisions between the United States and its European allies on such key issues as the Iran nuclear deal, as well as the diverse agendas being pursued by the participating countries. 
The foreign ministers and senior officials from 60 countries are attending the conference. But the absence of Federica Mogherini, high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, and the foreign ministers of key European powers such as Germany and France suggests Europe is not going to fall in line behind the US on the Middle East, especially after Washington last year unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — the EU still wants to save the deal — and its decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Europe considers too hasty. 
And the fact that Iran was not even invited, and its ally Russia declined to attend, suggests the meeting will be more like a trial by default against Iran — Washington has already accused Teheran of destabilizing the region and supporting terrorism, and vowed to change its ""behavior"" — rather than a platform for relevant parties to come together and find a solution to the problem they face through consultations and negotiations. 
Teheran has already dubbed the conference an ""anti-Iran circus"" and has firmly protested at Poland hosting the event. 
But even though Poland is lobbying the US for a permanent US base on its territory as part of its efforts to strengthen the Polish-US alliance against Russia, and thus wants to keep in Washington's good books, it has sought to emphasize that Iran is not the sole focus of the conference. 
And though the US may want the focus to be on Iran, other participants also appear to have different priorities. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, for instance, said he primarily wants to use the event to address the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 
The attendees will also be keen to hear the US plans for promoting peace between Palestinians and Israelis, which is also on the agenda, although the controversial decision by the White House to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem last year has basically made it impossible for the US to continue playing its role as a peace intermediary. 
The Palestinian government — which has called the Warsaw meeting an ""American conspiracy"" — has refused talks with the US until it implements a more balanced policy. 
The quest for peace in the Middle East shall never cease, but unfortunately the Warsaw meeting despite its claim to be in pursuit of that purpose is unlikely to serve that end.

"Mentality of US poses biggest threat to humanity from space: China Daily editorial","

 Forget asteroids, it is the United States and its pathological need to maintain its hegemony at any cost that pose the biggest threat to humanity from space. 
In its latest Defense Intelligence Agency report, the US claims that Russia and China have taken steps to challenge the US in space technology, blatantly ignoring the fact that space does not belong to it, and every country has the right to peacefully explore it. 
The report says that ""long-standing technological and cost barriers to space are falling, enabling more countries and commercial firms to participate in satellite construction, space launch, space exploration and human spaceflight"". 
But from the way it talks about what China and Russia or other countries have achieved in their development of space technology, it seems as if the US believes that when it planted a flag on the moon it staked the claim to have the sole use of space. 
Such a hegemonic mentality actually poses a threat to the world's peaceful exploration of space and the peaceful exploitation of it for the benefit of all people on Earth. 
It is with this mentality that the report catalogs and details supposed threats Russia and China may pose to the US in space. 
For the US, there is no justice and fairness when it comes to its relations with other countries, especially when it assumes that its dominance in a particular area is being challenged. 
Those who have written the report have listed threats that are anything but real. The US assumptions about the threats only serve to justify what it wants to do. In other words, the US is only making a case for maintaining its dominance in space technology. 
The ""Space Force"" the US administration has proposed, which will see huge amounts of resources devoted to pushing the US military capabilities in space, is what it really intends to achieve by positing that other countries with space technology pose a threat to its national security. 
Despite China's reiteration about it being committed to peaceful exploration of space and its openness to cooperation with any country in its development of space technology, the US will not give up its desire to have dominance in this domain, and it is devoting a great deal of effort to presenting China and Russia as threats to serve this purpose. 
Its huge investment in the development of a ""Space Force"" will, as a result, inevitably give rise to an arms race off the Earth, which will shatter the human dream of the peaceful exploration of space.

 With international efforts to combat the Islamic State terrorist group achieving decisive success in Syria and Iraq, the world has a hard-won opportunity to push forward the fight against terrorism and extremism. But that requires countries work together and show zero-tolerance to terrorists and their extremist ideologies. 
Which was the call for action that Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, made on Monday. His words should not fall on deaf ears. Instead, they should rally greater international consensus that concerted efforts are needed to eliminate terrorism and make members of the international community fully recognize the threat of all terrorist forces, including the so-called East Turkestan Islamic Movement. 
In recent years, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement has plotted and carried out a number of terrorist attacks in China, most frequently in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. 
The terrorist group has also posed a serious threat to countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, and some of its members have illegally crossed the border into Southeast Asian countries en route to join up with other terrorist groups in these regions. 
Despite this, some Western countries have deliberately tried to play down the threat posed by East Turkestan terrorist forces. Worse, some Western media have even equated the atrocities committed by East Turkestan terrorist elements in China to separatist violence. 
Such a double standard only discourages and hinders international efforts to combat terrorism in all forms. 
Drawing on the anti-terrorism experience of the international community and based on its own realities, the Chinese government has been actively working to counter terrorism and extremism and made notable achievements. 
But it is fully aware that terrorism is a common enemy of mankind, and no country can cope with it alone. Thus it has actively promoted international cooperation to fight terrorism, not least through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and its 2019-21 program of cooperation for combating the three evil forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism. 
The war on terror is at a critical juncture. The world community should embrace the concept of a community of shared future for mankind and forge greater unity of purpose. Those who harbor no prejudice or malicious intentions should be willing to oppose any double standard and genuinely seek greater solidarity.

"Pompeo puts US paranoia front and center in Europe: China Daily editorial","

 United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on a five-nation trip to Europe, of which the highlight is supposed to be the conference on the future of the Middle East, with a heavy emphasis on containing Iran. 
But that seems to have in no way diminished Washington's obsession with Huawei, and of course China. 
On the very first leg of the trip, in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, the top US diplomat once again issued an unsubstantiated allegation that the Chinese telecommunications company was a security risk, warning its NATO ally that its embrace of Huawei technologies presented ""actual risks"" to the Hungarian people and that it risked China using the technology ""in a way that is not in the best interest of Hungary"". Blahdiblah, you probably know how it goes by now. 
Of course, he made it sound reasonable: ""They are a sovereign nation"", he said. ""They get to make their own decisions"". 
But not really, since there is a choice to be made: Huawei or the US. 
Getting to the heart of the matter, he said if countries choose Huawei, it ""makes it difficult for America to be present … and makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them"". Which showed the US is not above some arm-twisting to get what it wants, and making it clear the US administration is motivated by more than simple technological, or business competition. 
Considering the Chinese tech giant has come into the White House's crosshairs, the latter's determination to coalesce an international siege against the company comes as no surprise, especially if it wants to sustain US commercial edge in the next-generation telecommunications market. But Pompeo made no secret about Washington's geopolitical anxiety. He confessed the US has its eyes on reversing what he called a decade of US disengagement in Central Europe that left a vacuum for Russia and China to exploit. He even warned his hosts of ""the dangers of allowing China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary"". 
The message cannot be clearer: the US is not only returning to continental Europe, it wants exclusive presence. Washington is worried about Russian and Chinese influence that it fears has grown in its own absence. Huawei is only an excuse. 
But Hungarian Foreign and Trade Minister Peter Szijjarto made a sensible point during a joint news conference with Pompeo: ""When it comes to cooperation with Russia or cooperation with the People's Republic of China that does not harm us being reliable as a NATO ally"". 
Indeed, why must a Budapest-Washington relationship be an exclusive one when Hungary relies on Russia for 85 percent of its energy needs and maintains close, extensive economic cooperation with China? 
No doubt, Pompeo will be hawking the same message to every other stop on his European trip. But the idea of exclusive relations may not sell everywhere. Because Budapest will certainly not be the only one to have smelled the ""enormous hypocrisy"" in such an approach.

 Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy seemed to be telling tales from the Arabian Nights when he accused China of ""serious human rights violations"" in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. In a statement on Saturday, he particularly tried to demonize China's counter-terrorism efforts in the region, calling the education facilities the government has set up there ""internment camps and prisons"" that are used for the purpose of ""systematic assimilation"". 
It is a pity that Ankara has resorted to presenting misinformation, misconceptions, and even complete lies, in making such groundless and irresponsible allegations. The Turkish spokesman revealed how spurious the allegations were, when he mentioned in his statement the ""tragic"" death of Uygur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who, in fact, is still alive and in good health in prison, where he is serving an eight year sentence for jeopardizing national security. 
Since the 1990s, terrorists, separatists and extremists in Xinjiang and abroad have plotted and conducted thousands of terrorist attacks in the region and the rest of the country, killing a large number of innocent people and hundreds of police officers. The establishment of education facilities including vocational training centers in Xinjiang is part of the central government's comprehensive efforts to fight the three evil forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, which are common enemies of humanity. 
Such facilities help people resist and purge extremist indoctrination through lessons that give them proficiency in Mandarin, knowledge of the law and vocational skills so that they can acquire some professional skills and get rid of religious fanaticism and extremist ideology before returning to society. 
Since their establishment more than two years ago, there have been no terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and tourist arrivals increased by 50 percent in 2018, suggesting the region is becoming more stable and safer. 
Meanwhile, people of various ethnic groups now enjoy unprecedented religious freedom in Xinjiang, where for an average of 530 Muslims there is one mosque, as compared with one for 910 Muslims in Turkey. 
Choosing to turn a blind eye to the facts, Turkey has attacked China over its anti-terrorism efforts, including the education facilities in Xinjiang. One cannot but raise an eyebrow over why Ankara has so readily subjected itself to bias and anti-China chorus before even conducting basic facts-checking, as such facilities are open to the world and have received visits from ambassadors to China and foreign correspondents, including the Turkish ones. 
In doing so, it has undoubtedly harmed mutual trust and done a disservice to the two countries' counter-terrorism and counter-separatism cooperation. Ankara should seek to repair the damage it has done to bilateral ties and the efforts to counter terrorism and extremism.

 To those who live on a steady diet of Hollywood bubble gum and who are gullible enough to believe everything they read or hear about evil regimes intent on taking over the world, it must seem like Brussels is the new Berlin — a hotbed of intrigue and espionage. 
At least that is what the European External Action Service would have them believe, according to a report in Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. 
Despite the fact that it apparently already has the capacity to listen in to everything that is said through backdoors supposedly installed in cellphones, computers, washing machines or anything else that has been made in China, it seems China still needs to give lodging to around 250 spies in its embassy and give them expenses so that they can surreptitiously dine in the same restaurants as European diplomats and military officials in the hope these powerful personages will inadvertently let slip some juicy nugget of information after a glass too many of Chablis. 
The claims of the EEAS, and those made by the Lithuanian intelligence and security services against the Chinese telecommunications leader Huawei, also last week, are the latest in a chorus of allegations against China and the Chinese company being orchestrated by the United States. 
This time the latest groundless accusations came after US officials toured EU capitals urging European governments not to use Huawei technology and equipment for next generation telecommunications infrastructure, and at a time when the EEAS is trying to keep the US sweet on NATO after Washington questioned its worth to the US. 
One only has to look at how counterintuitive it would be for China to sabotage its sound cooperation with its European partners — and the economic benefits it reaps from those good relations — given the increasing pressure the US is applying in their trade conflict to appreciate how ridiculous these accusations are. 
Indeed it is the trade dispute and competition between the world's two largest economies that explains why such reports have emerged now — The US is seeking whatever leverage it can to exert pressure on China, using its European allies in this way is just a matter of habit. 
Some politicians in both the US and EU countries may consider the scaremongering about China as ideologically necessary since China's rise as a communist country is the last thing they want to see. However, in doing so they have to turn a blind eye to the fact that China wants and needs a peaceful environment for its economic development and social progress. 
European politicians should realize that it will do their countries no good to unquestioningly follow Washington's lead. Doing so only plays into the hands of the US, which would be happy to get what it wants from a divided EU and the disintegration of the EU-China partnership.

"Right attitude to talks has been fruitful so far: China Daily editorial","

          China and the United States will hold a new round of high-level talks this week in their latest attempt to bridge their differences on economic and trade policies. Preparatory lower-level talks begin on Monday before the principal talks led by Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday.
That the respective delegations have progressively grown in size and the discussions have continued during the Christmas and Spring Festival holidays shows not only are both sides committed to finding a way to end their dispute, but also that concrete progress is being made toward achieving that goal.
In previous talks, China has shown its utmost sincerity by taking a practical problem-solving approach. For instance, by increasing imports of agricultural products from the US and accelerating the opening up of its financial sector. It has also agreed to take concrete measures to strengthen protection of intellectual property rights, a major concern of the US side.
The US, on its part, has gradually become less highhanded and more cooperative and the discussions have evolved to become more far-reaching and in-depth. But to ensure the world's two largest economies can ultimately reach a farsighted agreement that sets a solid foundation for the future of their relations, their upcoming discussions must continue to seek long-term remedies not quick-fix tonics.
As the two sides have listened to each other's concerns they have come to understand each other better. And since the leaders of the two countries met in Argentina in December and agreed on a 90-day process of talks to prevent an escalation of the dispute, tangible progress has been made in bridging their differences.
If the US side does not try to force China to implement untimely structural reforms there is no reason why further progress cannot be made if the two sides continue to talk in accordance with the principles of mutual respect and reciprocity, and with a willingness to work together for shared benefits.
Bearing this in mind, US President Donald Trump's remark on Thursday he did not expect to meet President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline for the two economic superpowers to reach a deal, does not foretell an agreement is not forthcoming or that the impending tariffs will be triggered.
Clearly there are still differences — perhaps sizable — to be overcome, but Trump's comment that a final resolution of the trade dispute would depend on the meeting with Xi ""in the near future"" suggests that they are not insurmountable hurdles.
Hopefully, this week's talks will get the two sides past a few more potential stumbling blocks and continue the good momentum that has been achieved since the two leaders set the process in motion.

 It has been confirmed a second summit between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un will take place on Feb 27-28 in Hanoi, Vietnam. 
Congratulations to both parties for taking another step toward ending one of the world's most dangerous standoffs and the ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. 
If the pending summit does end up sustaining the reportedly productive momentum of the preparatory negotiations, it will be remembered for laying solid groundwork for the critical next steps needed for the denuclearization process. 
There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense. Which is no doubt why the two parties seem to be diligently working together to present something truly deliverable. 
Trump, though he tends to on most things, sounds very optimistic about the upcoming meeting. ""North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse … a different kind of Rocket — an Economic one!"" he tweeted. The change-of-tone twist on an earlier tongue-in-cheek remark suggesting the two sides are at least talking cordially and respectfully to one another. 
But while the DPRK economy may indeed take off, it is unlikely to do so without a complete thaw in US-DPRK relations. Only then will Pyongyang be able to concentrate on developing the national economy, without having to worry about external security threats. And such a thaw is unlikely to materialize unless the current state of war is formally put to an end and the shadow of nuclear threats are removed. On these will hinge what Trump and Kim can deliver in Hanoi. 
Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for the DPRK, made an important point the other day on his return from ""productive"" preparatory talks in Pyongyang, ""We have some hard work to do with the DPRK between now and then."" Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty. 
And if the ""set of concrete deliverables"" for the second summit he reportedly discussed with DPRK officials did include Trump's readiness to officially conclude the Korean War, then perhaps we should join Trump in being optimistic about the summit, since that would show the White House is indeed committed to transforming US-DPRK ties and building lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. 
So let's extend our best wishes that the preparatory negotiations are both smooth and productive, and the Hanoi summit proves a success. For peace and stability in the region some concrete outcomes would certainly be most welcome.

          US President Donald Trump hailed the two-day talks between China and the United States as having made ""tremendous progress"" in the two sides' efforts to find a solution to their trade dispute. 
The progress is tremendous not only because the two sides have candidly discussed a series of divisive issues, such as trade, technology transfer, intellectual property protection and agriculture, and reached some agreement, but because, more important, they have demonstrated that specific discussions to find ways to address their differences with some mutual give-and-take can be ""fruitful"", as the Chinese delegation described the talks. 
Since the US initiated the ongoing dispute with China last year, it has imposed high tariffs on Chinese products — prompting tit-for-tat actions — and then repeatedly threatened harsher punishments. But such an unreasonable attitude and lack of respect for China's interests has harmed the US economy as well as China's, and threatened to inflict serious damage on the global supply chains that would take a long time to fix. 
The positive message being sent by both sides after their current talks suggests the two sides have realized that the most productive way to seek progress in promoting their respective interests is through candid consultations rather than confrontation. 
At his news conference on Thursday, after meeting with Vice-Premier Liu He, who headed the Chinese delegation, Trump said that a letter from President Xi Jinping — in which the Chinese president wrote that he hoped the two sides would continue to act in a spirit of mutual respect in order to reach an early agreement that works for the interests of both sides — had set the right tone for the talks and put them on a good footing. 
It was always wishful thinking to expect two days of talks to deliver a deal, but clearly the negotiations have been going on for a while and will continue after a short break for Chinese Lunar New Year, so the undoubtedly upbeat message that a deal could be in the offing if all goes well seems to be based on a clear understanding of what needs to be done to get it across the line. 
That the talks have produced a welcome consensus toward striking a comprehensive deal was confirmed by Liu, who said that it would ultimately be agreed when Xi and Trump meet. 
That both sides have said that a deal will ultimately have to be hammered home by the two leaders — in one or two meetings according to Trump — suggests there are still some sticking points to be overcome. 
But Trump was characteristically bullish, saying that ""when President Xi and myself meet, every point will be agreed to"". 
But even the more cautious words of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said it was impossible to predict success, gave grounds for optimism, as he said ""we are in a place that, if things work, it could happen"". 
The situation is complex, not least because China is in a critical stage in transforming its development mode. But the country is determined to deepen its reform and opening-up, and some of the US demands for structural reforms are in line with the direction the Chinese leaders have mapped out. The question now is, can a mutually agreeable timeframe for those be agreed before the March 1 deadline suspending further tariffs on Chinese goods expires? 
Having come this far toward meeting each other half-way, it would undo all the good work that has been done to build trust and make practical progress not to go the extra mile to clear the final hurdles.

"Why doesn't US ditch zero-sum mentality in African development?","

          When US National Security Adviser John Bolton was laying out the new US strategy for Africa, which he announced on Dec 13, his primary concern was not about helping African countries with their economic and social development, but rather about countering China and Russia to advance the United States' selfish geopolitical goals. 
Such a zero-sum mentality of a US politician came as no surprise. Former US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, and incumbent Vice-President Mike Pence have all labeled China's investment in, and trade with, Africa as ""predatory"" or ""debt trap"", or as tools of ""neocolonialism"". 
Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, has endorsed Bolton's remarks. In a National Review article, titled ""The Coming Scramble in Africa"", Herman argues that China and Russia are ahead of the game to a degree, but the US has the advantage going forward. Like Bolton, Herman is neither a China expert nor an Africa expert, and therefore sees everything China does as bad and a threat to the US. 
However skilled these people may be in waging a smear campaign against China, facts speak louder than words. Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is a leading authority in the field. And she gives China credit while pointing out its problems, unlike some pundits who only have a one-sided view: Everything China does is bad, and when bad things happen, it must be China's fault. 
Brautigam recently told The East African, a Kenyan newspaper, that successive US policymakers ""have been spreading myths and rumors about what the Chinese are doing"" in Africa, as during her four-year in-depth study on China, she found ""no evidence at all"" to support the US government's depiction of China as a stealthy ""villain"" intent on ""sucking"" Africa's blood. 
Contrary to the US charge, she argued that China does not typically give loans at high interest rates to African countries that it knows have little chance of repaying their debt. Rather, China varies its lending rates in accordance with its assessment of the African countries' repayment capabilities. 
She noted that the US and other Western governments have also invested and lent to African governments with egregious record of repression and corruption. Warning against the Cold War mentality of US politicians, Brautigam said the Trump administration lacks the means to implement the ""Prosper Africa"" plan which Bolton boasted. 
Compared with the US, which has long treated Africa as a continent that needs handouts, China, thanks to its experience of four decades of reform and opening-up, sees a promising future for Africa in helping lift people out of poverty and supporting it to achieve rapid economic and social development. 
That's why China surpassed the US in trade with Africa in 2009. In fact, China's trade with Africa shot up to $170 billion in 2017, three times the US trade volume. Chinese companies have been building infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and power grids because Beijing knows infrastructure is essential to maintain as well as accelerate economic growth. 
Bolton and some US pundits and media outlets have also alleged the People's Liberation Army logistics support base in Djibouti poses a threat to the nearby US military base. This claim is an example of sheer paranoia and beyond logic given the US' military might and its 800-plus military bases across the world. 
At a seminar in Madrid last month, Chinese and European experts and former officials pointed to the huge potential China and European countries would have if they joined hands in third markets such as Africa and Latin America. 
That's the sort of healthy and win-win mentality people like Bolton badly need to cultivate.

"Phone call could be beginning of change in Sino-US ties","

 The phone talk between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on Thursday was probably the most positive signal in the past months in China-US relations haunted by tit-for-tat tariff retaliations and concerns over a new Cold War. 
That they agreed to hold a meeting at the end of this month in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit is another positive signal. And the teams from the two sides will be working hard in the coming weeks to pave the way for a successful meeting. 
Despite Trump's China bashing rhetoric during his presidential campaign, the bilateral relationship started unexpectedly well during the first year of the Trump administration when the two leaders met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April last year and again during Trump's state visit to Beijing last November. 
But that amicable relationship took a steep downturn when the US singled out China as a revisionist power in its National Security Strategy last December and followed it up by a series of unilateral and hawkish moves against China, including punitive tariffs on imports from China, restrictions on Chinese investment in the US and hostile speeches on China such as the one made by Vice-President Mike Pence at the Hudson Institute on Oct 4. 
Fear-mongering about China, including the Chinese news media operating in the US, the 300,000-plus Chinese students studying in US universities and colleges and various academic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, has resurged drastically. 
The United States has also flirted with China's core national interests. The US Congress passed the provocative Taiwan Travel Act signed by Trump on March 16 this year. The US also threatened Latin American and African countries which sever ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan to establish formal relations with Beijing. 
The dramatic turnabout in Sino-US relations on multiple fronts has triggered deep concern over whether the world's existing power and the rising power are heading into a new Cold War or Thucydides Trap, as Harvard University scholar Graham Allison has warned. 
It is no secret that China and the US have major differences. And many of those differences will probably remain for a long time to come. No one, however, should deny that the two countries had far more differences and disagreements back in 1972 when US President Richard Nixon made the historic trip to China and in 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties. Yet the leaders of the two countries showed their wisdom by pursuing a path of expanding cooperation and managing and narrowing differences. 
There is no doubt that the more than four decades of active engagement and cooperation have brought huge benefits for the two nations and their peoples, and made the world a safer place, if we recall the extreme hostile relations back in the 1960s and especially the early 1950s when the two countries fought in the bloody Korean War. 
As philosopher George Santayana said, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The history of China-US relations serves as a warning for those who advocate a decoupling of the two economies, trigger an arms race and other confrontational approaches. 
Tackling the thorny issues between China and the US won't be easy. That is exactly why the two countries should work even harder on those issues through dialogues instead of confrontation. There is no better alternative. 
China and the US shoulder a great responsibility in tackling critical global issues, such as epidemic disease, climate change, peacekeeping and global governance. 
Let's hope that the upcoming meeting between Xi and Trump will help reverse the course of the past months.

 During the recent Spring Festival holiday, I took the 30-minute, southbound train from Beijing to Tianjin. The city is not only a significant landmark in my personal relationship with China, but increasingly like a second home. I didn't to be caught in traffic and the Spring Festival rush, so the ""Ford of Heaven"", as Tianjin is known, was a natural choice, a place where I thought I could unwind and indulge my passion for photography. 
In January this year BBC 2 Scotland program Scots in China showcased the lives of people from my Scottish homeland. Some, like me, had spent years living, working and contributing to the changes we continue to see across China. For my contribution to the show, I talked about China's railways 
It's been a 32-year personal passion, during which I experienced firsthand the introduction of high-speed rail. The filming in June 2018 began in Beijing South Railway Station before continuing to the newly introduced Fuxing train bound for Tianjin – now just 30 minutes down the line. Shooting continued around several Tianjin locations before culminating at a event organized by a local AmCham (American Chamber).

"The secret to China's technology edge: Team leadership","

[Photo/Xinhua] 
 The emergence of the Great Bay linking Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macao into a center for technology and artificial intelligence development has taken many by surprise. Will it be the next Silicon Valley on a scale far greater than imaginable in Palo Alto? The question everyone asks is how can China become a technology giant when its education system fosters group collective collaboration as opposed to the ego-driven ""I"" culture of Silicon Valley? Are the ""me first only"" values of manifest competitiveness heralded in American education really the secrets behind technology innovation? 
Certainly China's technology breakthroughs have been unexpected. This may have something to do with China's counterintuitive management approaches that are not understood in a Western work or education environment. Is it possible that innovation comes from collective purpose and collaboration rather than divisive competition? And the harder question: Is it possible that China's team approach to management allows more agile market responses and integrative approaches to technology development? 
""Many younger, bright leaders are rising,"" explains leadership guru Douglas Gerber who recently wrote leadership best-seller Team Quotient, which measures the current and future state of the team, and offers diagnostic approaches to effective team leadership. ""The challenge for China's management today in an era of accelerated technology advancement is that technology geeks may be brilliant, but they are not natural leaders,"" notes Gerber. ""So that's where the concept of team management kicks in. Due to its team culture, the Team Quotient or TQ approach is very effective in China."" 
China succeeds through team leadership rather than individual ego. Gerber observes, ""We found that when you measure and work with a team, it takes between one to two years for it to achieve synergy and integrative capacity, therefore TQ is essential."" 
Team Quotient studies have shown that several things start to happen after this one- to two-year threshold. Firstly, high performance kicks in. This is evidenced through superior performance, from results from output, and from creativity to financial results. Secondly, high engagement scores arise, meaning in short that people are increasingly motivated. Thirdly, return on investment is better assured because investing in the team is less risky than the individual. The improved results will justify the investment in the team many times over. 
A Silicon Valley celebrity CEO may shoot off angry tweets, resulting in a drop in the company's share price. That won't happen with a high-powered talented team approach, mitigating the loss from an individual leaving, or a leader going on an emotional rampage, as some overly wired Silicon Valley CEOs have been known to do.   
""The Alpha leader approach that characterized Chinese management in past decades is shifting,"" explains Gerber. ""Chinese leaders today are less likely to seek accolades for themselves, but rather for their team."" Leaders are focused on team leadership, not standing out as the individual hogging the team's success for oneself, as with some celebrity CEOs in the West. In the case of Chinese management, the leaders win by standing behind the team and being the force or motivation that guides the team to success, rather than standing in front of the team and seeking credit for themselves."" 
Maybe it is time to break all the stereotypes. Gerber observes, ""Chinese managers want success. They want to be successful as a team for their company, not just for themselves. It is the collective team spirit and drive for success that excites them and gets their juices moving."" 
Culturally, China's team approach juxtaposes sharply against the Silicon Valley CEO celebrity media cults. Chinese CEOs are low-key, almost self-effacing, more interested in results than accolades. Contrast that with America's electric vehicle (EV) industry in which there is only one name -- Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who is the only person the media talks about when discussing electric vehicles. Paradoxically, today China sees much bigger domestic sales in electric vehicles, and is forecast to soon be the leader globally in EVs. However, you rarely hear about Chinese EV CEOs as celebrities, but rather their companies. The implication is that instead of focusing on the ego – the ""I"" culture of Silicon Valley, Chinese leaders are on focusing on the teams that make it happen. 
China will lead EV technology in a few years and the statistics are revealing. At the end of 2017, China had the largest fleet of electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units, having overtaken both the US and Europe in terms of cumulative sales the year before in 2016. China has been the world's best-selling plug-in electric car market for three years running since 2015 with annual sales of more than 207,000 plug-in passenger cars in 2015 and 320,000 in 2016 and record sales of 600,000 passenger electric vehicles in 2017, which accounted for half of the global EV sales that year. China has over 20 EV manufacturers, many of them relatively new in the auto industry. So how have they been able to run circles around Tesla? 
While models like Tesla may offer prototypes, adapting aspects of the Tesla success and making it relevant to China's market needs, road conditions and social behavioral patterns is not stealing technology but advancing it. Maybe it is due to the collective drive of their R&D and team leadership, rather than a company being built around an individual whose temperament, whims and Twitter outbursts can send markets on a rocket trajectory, or jitter them into collapse. Team leadership has been proven to create a more sustainable and successful future. 
Western classic automotive manufacturers like GM, VW, Daimler and BMW are also trying to hype the Tesla model and come out with their own versions for the EV market. Actually it is a huge challenge for them to embrace this market, because their whole industry is based on old technology and management approaches. In China many of the EV companies are startups with youthful management and a fresh management approach, not encumbered by the old mentality. ""Chinese are not just taking others technology,"" explains Gerber, ""Actually they are creating new companies around new concepts."" 
This is all about the collective mobilization around a vision, with everyone working together in synergy for the ultimate success of that vision. 
The ability to execute rapidly is not about an individual making all the decisions, rather about changing that focus to enablers, allowing individuals on the team to accelerate and lead their sub teams to success. This team approach enables innovation and speed, the two elements of the secret formula behind China's enterprise and technology success. Firstly, you only get there when people work together. Secondly, that requires team leadership.

"Nobel Peace Prize should  not be used as political tool: China Daily editorial","

   A screen grab from CCTV 13 shows lham Tohti at the court in 2014. 
 In a move that interferes in China's internal affairs, US lawmakers from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China nominated Ilham Tohti, a jailed Uyghur teacher, for the Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday. 
Tohti, a former teacher at Beijing's Minzu University of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014 for promoting separatism. But in the letter of nomination sent to the president of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, and its other members, he was eulogized as a scholar that ""embodies the peaceful struggle for peace and human rights in China"", and thus there is ""no one more deserving of the committee's recognition in 2019"" than him. 
By nominating someone who has committed serious crimes by undermining peace and stability in China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the US lawmakers are trying to humiliate China. 
In fact, the nomination itself runs counter to the spirit of the prize which aims to promote peace worldwide. The committee already faces a lot of criticism for handing out its laurels to some controversial figures in recent years. 
This is not the first time that the Nobel Peace Prize has been used as a political tool by outside anti-China forces to meddle in the Xinjiang issue. Back in 2006, notorious Xinjiang separatist Rebiya Kadeer, the ""chairwoman"" of the so-called World Uygur Congress, was nominated for the same prize. 
Of course, there is a big difference between nomination and actually winning the prize, but the latest move shows US lawmakers still want to send a message to the world to express their opposition to China's policy in Xinjiang. As before, their ulterior motives are doomed to fail. 
The current peaceful and stable situation in Xinjiang is clear evidence that the central government's efforts to counter separatist ideology in the region are working and its policy has won widespread support from all Chinese people, including Uygurs in Xinjiang. 
True, there is a stark contrast between the Chinese and Western judgments on the situation in Xinjiang. But the Xinjiang issue is complicated and sensitive as it not only involves the issue of sovereignty and human rights but also ethnicity and religion. 
Hence, it is inappropriate for the US lawmakers to try and simplify the Xinjiang issue as discrimination on the part of China. Those in Washington need to take off their biased spectacles and view Xinjiang through a more objective and fair lens.

"Actions against Huawei cold war of technology: China Daily editorial","

 It was reported on Wednesday that the European Union is considering proposals that would effectively amount to a de facto ban on Huawei's equipment for next-generation mobile networks based on concerns that it might compromise national security. This is just the latest move in a concerted series of attacks on the Chinese telecom giant by the United States and its allies. 
By making such allegations, if the European Commission were to amend the definition of critical infrastructure in EU law to include 5G mobile networks, it would effectively prohibit EU businesses from using Huawei equipment on the grounds it might be used for spying or sabotage. 
The constant detraction of Huawei has been orchestrated by the US, as part of its pressure tactics to contain China. Having conjured the accusation that the Chinese company represents a national security threat out of thin air, it has roped in its allies as accomplices in its fear mongering. The attacks against Huawei are now unabating and unceasing. Indeed, on the part of the US, they have become increasingly nasty, as shown by the charges announced against the company and some of its representatives by the US Justice Department on Tuesday. 
The slander, discrimination, pressure and coercion of the US and its allies are nothing more than a pretext to squeeze Huawei out of the global market. The US would consider it a victory in the technology cold war it is waging against China if it could eliminate Huawei. And it would be of particular significance to the EU, as the other leading 5G companies are Sweden's LM Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. 
Yet Huawei supplies 45 of the top 50 global telecom companies and has signed contracts with 30 carriers to test its next-generation technology. Given how integrated the telecommunications industry is, blocking Huawei's development will also harm the development of other countries' telecom companies and the industry as a whole. 
Huawei will do whatever it can to protect its rights and interests. It has already set up laboratories in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom for their governments to conduct security tests on its software and hardware. 
But the actions of the US and its allies have nothing to do with national security or fair competition. Instead, they are the actions of a politically motivated lynch mob as the West seeks to obstruct China's development as a world power in science and technology. 
The US has long used national security as an excuse to deny exports of key technologies to China. And whenever Chinese technology companies cut conspicuous figures overseas through their own efforts, the US is on pins and needles until it can find a way to suppress their development. 
Beyond the immediate horizon of the US-instigated persecution of Huawei lies the future digital society. Countries should reflect on how that society can avoid the persistence of past prejudices.

"Defense radar plan puts regional stability at risk: China Daily editorial","

 In another provocative move that may further complicate regional security and even spark a new arms race among major powers, the United States is reportedly mulling a plan to deploy a new stationary radar — the Homeland Defense Radar — in Japan to help reinforce the US system aimed at intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting US territories.  
The US already boasts the world's most advanced land-based anti-ballistic missile system, with missiles deployed in Alaska and California to intercept attacks. Yet in the Missile Defense Review released on Jan 17, US President Donald Trump still expressed the intention to reinforce that system, citing threats of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks by Russia, China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The radar deployment is just part of that plan. 
Building unrivaled and unmatched military supremacy for the US has been in Trump's mind ever since he came to office. His professed military buildup ambition includes a dramatic increase in US nuclear stockpiles and building a Space Force to turn space into a war-fighting domain like the land, air and sea. His threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty risks undoing all disarmament efforts the world has witnessed over the past decades.  
But the claim these moves are in response to military threats to the US is absurd. No country poses any danger to the world's sole superpower, whose military spending is more than that of all other major countries combined. 
But hyping up threats from real and imagined adversaries has been a pretext Washington likes to use to seek uncontested military domination in the world. In 2017 it used the threat of missile attacks from the DPRK to install its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system in the Republic of Korea, breaking the existing military balance in the region.  
The situation on the Korean Peninsula has improved markedly since last year. A historic summit was held between Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, with both leaders expressing their commitment to denuclearization and ending decades of hostilities. 
Since both countries are working for peace on the peninsula, the radar plan seems out of place, it will only do a disservice to the ongoing detente and trust building and may even derail efforts to make the region nuclear free.  
History proves that seeking unilateral and absolute security at the cost of the security of other countries will only trigger an arms race, which in return will cause more instability and make the world a more dangerous rather than a safer place. Washington must abandon its Cold War mentality and stop its aggressive moves for the good of peace and stability in the region.

"Taiwan 'nationhood' talk only leads it to abyss: China Daily editorial","

          Responding to the recent clamor in Taiwan for a new ""constitution"", Beijing warned on Wednesday that pursuing ""jurisprudential independence"" with a new ""constitution"" will only push Taiwan down a ""dangerous abyss"".
The mainland will ""absolutely not sit on our hands looking"", said a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office.
There is every sign that, instead of learning the real lesson from their Nov 24 defeat in the island's local elections, hardcore independence seekers in the Democratic Progressive Party are trying to blaze a more radical trail. But their adventure is destined to be fruitless and, as Beijing has admonished, hazardous. Suicidal, to be precise.
Inaugurating his ""Taiwan New Constitution Foundation"" on Jan 23, long-term ""independence"" advocate Koo Kwang-ming said a new ""constitution"" would give Taiwan a sense of ""nationhood"".
Koo, who is now 93, can hardly make a difference, good or bad, regarding the status of Taiwan. No matter how hard he tries.
Equally obviously, though, the ambitious Lai Ching-te thinks he can. The former head of the ""executive yuan"", who stepped down on Jan 11 as a result of the DPP's Nov 24 failure, endorsed Koo's aspiration for a new ""constitution"".
Present leader Tsai Ing-wen's obsession with the ""status quo"" of relations across the Taiwan Straits has limited Taiwan's participation in the international community, Lai said. To change that, the island needs a new ""constitution"".
With that, Taiwan will be able to solve the issue of being an ""unrecognized nation"". In his words, Taiwan would have stayed within the United Nations had then leader Chiang Kai-shek not refused to participate alongside Beijing. Completely ignoring the historical truth that the UN members recognized Beijing as the sole, official representative of China.
Accordingly, he attributed the DPP's latest defeat to Tsai's disloyalty to the party's fundamental goal of independence, and the party's failure to translate corresponding advocacy and opinions into ""the next step"".
While Lai labels himself as a ""pragmatic worker"" for ""jurisprudential independence"", many believe in so doing he is just wooing support from the ""deep green"" faction for his potential bid for local leadership in the 2020 elections. Once he fills Tsai's shoes, observers say, he too, like all DPP predecessors, will hover around the ""status quo"".
All such, uncertainties notwithstanding, one thing is for sure. Beijing will not tolerate any move toward ""jurisprudential independence"". The mainland's Anti-Secession Law has no ambiguity about that.
Its Article 5 stipulates, ""upholding the principle of one China is the basis of peaceful reunification of the country"". The new ""constitution"" Koo and Lai advocate would inevitably eliminate that basis. What follows then, would indeed be an abyss of devastating potential.

"Trade talks are not a contest to see who blinks first: China Daily editorial","

          It is being anticipated that the upcoming talks between China and the United States will produce some positive results, but whether those expectations are met will depend on both sides being genuine in their efforts to bridge their differences and reach an agreement. 
The high profile makeup of the Chinese delegation that arrived in Washington on Monday for the economic and trade negotiations scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, shows that China is sincere in seeking a workable solution to the two countries' ongoing trade standoff. 
Led by Vice-Premier Liu He, the delegation includes top officials from the central bank, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, as well as the Ministry of Commerce and other ministries. 
However, sincerity from Beijing alone will not be enough. 
That is why US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Monday that President Donald Trump is set to meet Liu during his visit has been interpreted as a good sign as it suggests the US is also participating in the talks in good faith. 
But while it is evident to both sides that it is in their own interests, and to the benefit of the world economy as a whole, that they end their trade dispute, it remains to be seen if they can maneuver their way to such an outcome. Especially given the US Justice Department's actions against the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei and its chief financial officer, which were announced on Monday. 
Given the timing, this has been widely perceived to be a ploy to push for the structural reforms the US wants, but the issues to be discussed are complicated enough, without any additional complications being added to the mix. 
The two sides will need to ensure their discussions stay on track if a framework for progress is to be produced, without which it will be very hard to prevent the cease-fire ending without an agreement. The subsequent trade war would do grievous harm to the global economy, as well as the Chinese and US economies. As the global financial crisis that originated in the US showed, such damage would take a long time to fix. 
Just the breadth and depth of their discussions is daunting to consider. Nevertheless, China's commitment and determination to deepen reform and opening-up have been demonstrated with new measures that provide a solid platform to build on, so long as the two sides can agree on a time frame for further measures, and reciprocal actions are forthcoming. 
There will be around 30 days for further negotiations after the meetings in Washington before the March 2 deadline for the suspension of further US tariffs on Chinese goods expires. It is to be hoped that focuses attention on the need to be reasonable and sober-minded, because a full-scale trade war between the two economic powerhouses would certainly make for more uncertain times.

 At a news conference, acting US Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said that two affiliates of Huawei had been indicted on 10 federal crimes related to accusations that Huawei stole technology from T-Mobile, and that Huawei, its chief financial officer, an affiliate in Iran and one of its subsidiaries in the US had been indicted on 13 charges related to allegations that Huawei committed financial fraud by violating US sanctions against doing business with Iran. 
That these charges are politically motivated should be evident from the extrajudicial nature of the sanctions-busting accusation — which reveals more about the ingrained US hostility toward Iran — and the fact the T-Mobile technology in question, robotic technology that tests the durability of smartphones, was proudly being displayed on YouTube before the Huawei employees allegedly stole it. 
The fact that Apple, Facebook and Uber, among others, have been accused of stealing trade secrets, as well as a steady stream of cases where people leave a company with its know-how and sell that knowledge to competitors, shows how cut and thrust the technology competition is. 
Yet over the years, even though the US has developed a penchant for accusing Chinese companies of stealing trade secrets and being a threat to national security, on no occasion has it provided any solid evidence. 
Last October, Bloomberg claimed China was putting spy chips in the hardware of US companies. The companies cited denied that possibility. And no matter how strong one's allegiance to the Stars and Stripes may be, so far the only country that has been caught resorting to such nefarious practices is, you guessed it, the US. 
Such unwarranted accusations reveal the truth often demonstrated, that the US, being in possession of a big fortune, believes other countries are beneath it. China is at the crucial stage of its transformation from being a large country to becoming a strong one, and this success, as embodied by companies such as Huawei, has invited detraction. 
Washington should be told a lie will not become truth even if it is repeated 1,000 times, or more. 
The latest US decision, together with its pending request to Canada for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, shows the US is determined to take a hard line on the Huawei case, but this will not deter either China or Huawei from pursuing the heights of the 21st century.

 The West has long taken pride in claiming the moral high ground with regard to the rule of law, a just and transparent business environment and a level playing field for businesses, while at the same time accusing China of lacking them. But the way some Western countries are suppressing the development of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei gives the lie to these claims and shows them to be nothing more than a means to an end. 
So much for the presumption of innocence — Huawei has been declared guilty without a trial and without any hope of appeal in the United States, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, all of which have banned the use of its equipment. And the European Union seems set to follow suit. 
It doesn't take the deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes to see the United States is the common factor in this witch hunt, as the others are all its go-to allies. Their actions are a concerted effort to use national security as an excuse to destroy the legitimate business operations of the Chinese company which are in full swing. 
Why? Because as Ren Zhengfei, CEO and founder of Huawei, said in a rare interview recently there are only a few manufacturers in the world that can make 5G products, and Huawei is the best of them, and it is currently the only manufacturer in the world that is capable of equipping 5G base stations with the state-of-the-art microwave technology. 
So despite the fact Huawei has been operating in 170 countries worldwide, including in developed countries, without causing any concerns, and despite the fact it has signed 30 5G commercial contracts and delivered more than 25,000 5G base stations worldwide without being involved in any security incident, the US — perhaps concerned it will no longer be able to spy on everyone if it is not the one that has supplied the equipment, it being the only one known to do so — has been rounding up its allies to conduct a smear campaign against the Chinese company. 
That its allies have readily joined the politically motivated game the US has orchestrated is extremely disappointing as it shows they have surrendered any autonomy of action. It is especially upsetting that the EU might decide to join them, as China has always considered the bloc to be a comprehensive strategic partner that it can work with to uphold rules-based multilateralism and oppose the might-is-right unilateralism of the US. 
However, it is evident that the fear mongering of the US has been paying off, and its allies are willing to follow its lead in violating free business competition and the rule of law for a pat on the back. Even the US' highhanded action in pursuing Huawei's chief financial officer has not given these countries pause for thought. 
Instead of letting the US tell it what to do, the EU should exercise its own discretion.

"US stance toward Iran on wrong side of history: China Daily editorial","

 A while back, the US president said his country would no longer act as the world's policeman. However, it seems this will be a habit the long-authoritarian Washington finds hard to kick. Certainly in terms of the long-arm jurisdiction it likes to apply on the assumption that by drawing up a domestic law it can dictate to everyone, everywhere, what they can and cannot do. 
While the United States can introduce domestic legislation to prevent its own companies from doing business with anyone it dislikes, it has no legal grounds for applying that legislation to non-US entities. 
If, based on their relations, the US' allies opt to voluntarily coordinate and side with the US on a certain matter, that is their decision, right or wrong. But no country is under any obligation to observe sanctions unilaterally imposed by the US. So while Washington's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was in blatant disregard of its own international obligations, its latest attempt to deter the European Union from engaging with Teheran is an outrageous transgression. 
The White House has warned the EU to not proceed with an alternative payment arrangement mechanism with Iran, saying it would deem it to be in breach of the US sanctions against Teheran. 
All the other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal share the belief it is as good as it can be. Which is why, even with Washington gone, they have demonstrated their unanimous commitment to its continued implementation. 
Inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency have found no violation of the deal on Teheran's part. In other words, the deal has held on both sides. But although the deal has proved effective, the current administration has not only withdrawn the US from the deal, it continues to pursue a maximum pressure campaign against Iran for reasons originating from previous mistakes and misjudgments by Washington. 
Instead of imposing unilateral punishing sanctions, Washington should be thankful that the deal has held. After all, it has put in nothing but has still reaped the rewards of peace. But then maybe, that is not what it wants. After all, as well as stopping Iran building a nuclear bomb, the deal also prevented the possibility of a war with Iran. Destroying the deal would restore that potentiality. 
Washington's current approach to Teheran is a dangerous round of gambling that risks not only ruining what the international community has achieved on the nuclear issue, but also further destabilizing the Middle East. 
Decision-makers in Washington should know the nuclear deal is only a nuclear deal. Attaching too much to it will simply not work, and punishing the EU for doing the right thing will only end up hurting the US itself in the long run.

"Better cross-Straits relations can help island boost its economic growth","

[Photo/Xinhua] 
 A recent online poll showed about 80 percent of the netizens in Taiwan don't believe Su Tseng-chang can significantly promote economic growth after succeeding Lai Ching-te as the island's executive head, according to CTnews, a digital media outlet. The netizens' views are based on the past records of how much positive impact a change in the island's ruling party or ""cabinet"" leaders has had on economic development. 
The Taiwan economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 percent from 1962 to 2000, making the island one of the top ""Asian Tiger"" economies, as well as creating an overall affluent society. 
But since 2000, when the ""pro-independence"" Democratic Progressive Party assumed the island's leadership for the first time, Taiwan has seen a constant outflow of resources, a slowing economy, a growing gap between the rich and poor, stagnating wages, a widening fiscal gap, and an aging urban and rural society. 
The annual growth rate of the Taiwan economy was about 3.4 percent from 2001 to 2008, close to one-third of the rate between 1962 and 2000. What are the main causes of this drastic slowdown? And how can Taiwan accelerate economic growth? 
Although it occupies a relatively good position in the global economy, Taiwan is a small economy suffering the disadvantage of limited resources and a small hinterland market. 
Therefore, compared with large economies, the island needs to more urgently cooperate and integrate with the world economy. First, it has to introduce more friendly and open policies to improve the investment environment and adopt more liberal trade practices to promote imports. And second, it has to reach agreements with other economies to promote free trade and sharpen the competitiveness of its products in the world markets to increase exports. 
The island's economy worked well from the 1960s to the 1990s when the United States, the European Union and Japan were drivers of the world economy, and the Chinese mainland's economy was still to take off. Thus, cross-Straits ties had little influence on the island's economy at the time, and establishing good relations with the US, the EU and Japan was enough for the island to reap the fruits of fast-paced economic development by exploiting global resources and markets. 
However, with the rise of the mainland, much has now changed in the world economy. The mainland has become both the ""factory"" and market of the world, and therefore greatly influences the Taiwan economy. 
Thanks to successive Taiwan authorities prioritizing politics over their mainland policies, cross-Straits relations have not been normalized, preventing the liberalization of trade across the Straits, which is critical to Taiwan's economic survival. 
Deliberately maintaining a distance from the mainland market, the island, unlike in the past, is unable to make good use of world resources and world markets, which have significantly undermined investors' confidence in and outside Taiwan. Plus, the cost of production has been constantly rising on the island, leading to the flight of capital and industries, and the marginalization of its economy in the world. 
The shortage of investment and lack of free trade are apparent causes of the slowdown of the island's economy. But the root cause is the uncertainty in cross-Straits relations, for it has prevented the island from fully integrating in the global economic machine. 
With economic globalization and regional integration, as well as the growth of the mainland as a major center of globalization, the development of the island's economy fundamentally depends on peaceful and stable cross-Straits relations, and the economic integration of the two sides. 
Or else, the island's economy will be further marginalized, resources and capital will keep flowing out, its industrial innovation and economic transformation will slow down further, and the gap between the rich and the poor will widen. As a result, in the next 20 to 30 years, the island's economy would be stifled. 
This is to say, for Taiwan, poor cross-Straits ties will lead to a poor economy, and only through improved cross-Straits relations can the island's economy prosper.

 Whatever has happened in Venezuela, it is still a sovereign country which has the say over its own fate. No country has the right to dictate to this nation and its people how to settle its own political crisis. 
The US administration, which is averse to Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro, only made the situation in Venezuela more complicated when it announced it recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido, after he declared himself president on Wednesday claiming that Maduro's reelection last year was fraudulent. 
Following the lead of the US, the European Union on Saturday gave Maduro an ultimatum to call elections within eight days or it too would support Guaido. An ultimatum that was dismissed as ""childish"" by Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza. 
Guaido reportedly met with the government officials on the weekend to convince them of the need for new elections. Although with international support, he has no control of the state, which he is hoping to gain with the promise of amnesty for those who switch allegiance to him. 
Meanwhile, Maduro's government has backtracked on an order that gave US embassy personnel 72 hours to leave Venezuela, saying it had opened a 30-day window to negotiate with the Trump administration, defusing tensions between the countries just hours after their top diplomats traded heated rhetoric at a special meeting of the UN Security Council. 
Given the increasingly fierce confrontation between Maduro's government and the opposition, it is not just improper but also dangerous for other countries to take sides, as it will only intensify the divisions and may even spark a civil war in the country. 
External political or even military interference has the likelihood of plunging the country into chaos. Latin America has plentiful experience of the cost of US-led interference and military ""solutions"" to crises. 
For Venezuelan people, violence or even a civil war as a result of the fierce confrontation between Maduro's government and the opposition should be the last thing they want, as it will only plunge the South American country into turmoil and cause even more suffering. 
What has happened in Syria in the Middle East, where a civil war has lasted for years between the Syrian government forces and those opposing it, should serve as a mirror to reflect what would likely happen should the situation in Venezuela spin out of control. 
If there is a chance for a political process to develop between Maduro's government and the opposition for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, other countries should do whatever they can to promote that process. Even if they find no way to extend a helping hand, they should respect the sovereignty of Venezuela and take no action to intervene.

 The political life of John McCallum, who was the Canadian ambassador to China, took a dramatic turn on Friday after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau forced him to resign for his comments regarding Canada's detention of Huawei's chief financial officer, who is being held by Canada at the request of the United States. 
Everybody knows that the US is seeking the extradition of Meng Wanzhou as part of its pressure tactics against the Chinese tech company and China. McCallum was merely stating the truth when he observed that Meng has a strong case against extradition, which he rightly said was politically motivated. 
The Canadian government may feel obliged to dance to the tune of the US, and that, in this instance, the bilateral extradition treaty between the two countries gives it an excuse to do so. But it should not let its commitment to Washington confuse right and wrong and even becloud its judgment about what is fair and just. 
As McCallum pointed out, the political interference from the White House, the extraterritorial nature of the charges and the fact that Canada is not party to US sanctions against Iran all mean Meng has a strong case against extradition. 
In fact, he could have gone further and made it clear that the spurious request for her extradition means she should not have been detained in the first place. 
Although what he said is 100 percent true, his words seem to have fallen on deaf ears at home. Those who had attacked McCallum should feel ashamed of themselves. 
Trudeau's firing of the ambassador shows how sensitive Ottawa is to the pickle it has got itself into at the behest of the US. 
In fact, before the Huawei case broke out, Trudeau had been dedicated to improving bilateral ties, and sending McCallum, an old China hand, to Beijing was part of his efforts. 
The US has made it clear last week it will pursue Meng's extradition, so the political mess that Ottawa is floundering in could get a lot worse if it chooses to accede to the US request for Meng's extradition despite the problems with the case that McCallum, among others, has pointed out. 
It is high time Trudeau reflected upon whether it is worthwhile allowing the US to lead him by the nose. 
The best solution for Ottawa to emerge with any credibility from the mess it has created is to admit its error of judgment and return freedom to Meng. It is hoped Ottawa will make the wise choice, a choice that is based on reason and fairness and not on political calculations of how to best get on with the country's rambunctious southern neighbor.

 The ongoing three-month national crackdown on illegal practices in the health products market, which started early this month, is a welcome move. 
Problems, such as false advertising, counterfeit goods and poor-quality products, have long existed in this sector and they have become a consistent source of complaints. Many consumers of these products are senior citizens, often with chronic diseases and without much knowledge about medical science, and they tend to easily fall prey to the promotional spiel of the sellers, who may even be part of a scam. 
As China enters an aging society, the demand for health products from senior citizens continues to grow. The size of the market — which includes food, equipment and wearable devices — is estimated to already be worth billions of dollars, and it is expected to grow at a double-digit rate in the years to come. 
Yet compared with the explosive market expansion, government supervision has lagged far behind, often compromised by a shortage of law enforcement personnel and the lack of coordination among different government departments. For example, it is the public health departments that are responsible for verifying the claims of health food advertisements, yet the right to law enforcement rests with the market regulatory agency. This situation inevitably leads to passing the buck and even neglect of duties. 
This explains why Tianjin-based health products giant, Quanjian, could be so successful, before its many irregularities such as false advertising and pyramid-style selling were exposed. The local government conducted an investigation into the company only after a social media post — claiming a 7-year-old girl died after forgoing medical treatment in favor of taking herbal products that Quanjian claimed could treat cancer — sparked a public outcry. 
It is unrealistic to expect the health products market will be spotlessly clean and in impeccable order after the campaign. The huge profits to be gained — many products are sold at a price a dozen times their actual costs — mean there will always be those ready to take a chance testing the moral and legal bottom line. 
To deter them in the long run, laws must be updated and institutional reform must be carried out to make a national supervision system more responsive and efficient. The China Food and Drug Administration has already established a new department to better manage ""special food"" registration. 
Yet more needs to be done, and people need to be better informed of how to live a healthy lifestyle, so they are not so easily duped by the quick-fix claims of false health advertising.

 What Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan told the global leaders and business elite attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, was a candid declaration of Beijing's policy and position, as well as a rallying call for concerted efforts to oppose protectionism and unilateralism. 
Reaffirming the pro-globalization, pro-multilateralism stance that President Xi Jinping put forward in his widely acclaimed speech at the forum in Davos two years ago, Wang firmly positioned Beijing as a still-steadfast proponent of economic globalization. 
China is fully committed to preserving economic globalization and ""wishes to work with all countries for common development"", Wang said. But he made it clear that China will continue to adhere to a development path that suits its own conditions and is in keeping with the trend of the times. 
To those listening, his remarks should have made it clear that Beijing wants to work with others for mutual benefits but it will not pander to unrealistic expectations of how it can benefit others. 
It has recently been suggested by some in the developed countries that what China has achieved has been purely because those countries and their companies extended altruistic helping hands to raise China up. 
That distorts the truth and insults the Chinese people. As Xi said recently, what China has achieved is the result of its own vision, hard work and courage; it is not ""a gift from others"". 
He has made it clear that the country will continue to advance reform and opening-up, but it will only change what needs to be changed, it will not change what should or cannot be changed. 
Those words may not have been pleasant to some ears. But Wang reiterated them in Davos. 
Since the US delegation didn't attend this year's forum due to that country's government shutdown, it is to be hoped that message does not get distorted in its relaying. 
With trade talks between the United States and China due to take place next week, a positive outcome requires both to have realistic expectations of what they can take by appreciating what the other can give. 
Hopefully, Washington realizes that the Chinese and US economies are mutually indispensable, and as Wang said, their relations must be mutually beneficial and win-win. 
Indeed, the frictions between the two countries do not stem inherently from their relations as some suggest, but rather from the problems in the global economy, such as the lack of new growth drivers, unbalanced development and uneven income distribution, as well as the changes being unleashed by new technologies and new industries. 
These problems and changes will not be overcome by looking inward since they are universal in nature. The only way to overcome the problems and meet the challenges is to embrace the trend of the times and seize the potential of connectivity and cooperation.

          In a blatant interference into China's internal affairs, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday intended to promote the participation of Taiwan in the World Health Organization and other international forums.
For the House Resolution 353 to become law, it still needs to be passed by the US Senate. Then it will direct the US secretary of state to campaign for the participation of Taiwan in international organizations such as the WHO and Interpol. As such, it is a malicious violation of the one-China principle.
The United States should honor the one-China commitment it made in the three joint communiqués that laid the foundation for the two countries to establish formal diplomatic ties and not proceed to make this provocative resolution law.
This is not the first time that the US Congress has tried to play the Taiwan card in the world arena in this way. According to media reports, the same resolution was passed by the House of Representatives last year but failed to gain approval from the Senate due to procedural issues.
But Washington should know by now that any attempt to internationalize the Taiwan question will be a mission impossible. The UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and World Health Assembly Resolution 25.1 provide the legal basis for the WHO to follow the one-China principle. It will be futile to try and challenge this.
Given the sensitivity of the Taiwan question, the US should handle it with caution and refrain from making any moves that may send the wrong signal to Taiwan separatists by encouraging them in their deluded ambition to attain ""independence"" for the island.
The Tsai Ing-wen administration has repeatedly tried to gain membership status for the island in international bodies such as the WHO in bid to gain de facto recognition for an ""independent"" Taiwan.
Those in the US trying to help Tsai manipulate health fears in an attempt to expand the international space to challenge the one-China principle should listen to the voice of the majority of Taiwan people, who in the island's recent local elections showed they categorically reject Tsai's approach, forcing her to step down as head of her party.
It should be clear why Tsai is in such an embarrassing position: The previously cordial relations across the Taiwan Straits would not have come to an abrupt end had she not pursued her pro-independence, anti-mainland policy.
Those US politicians, who think playing the Taiwan card in this way will help the US gain leverage in its ""rivalry"" with the Chinese mainland, are only fooling themselves.
No matter what the US does it will not be able to brush aside the clear legal status that the island is part of one China.

 For a fairly long period of time, United States President Donald Trump sounded like he was the only person in the US administration confident the trade talks with China would result in a deal. 
However, it seems there are others that share his optimism. 
Speaking by video to those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he too expected a good outcome from the upcoming conversations. 
Although that shared confidence may be rooted in the mistaken belief that Beijing will have to cave in because the Chinese economy has been taking a battering, the fact that the administration is receptive to reaching a deal, rather than just going through the motions for the sake of appearances, is welcome. 
A successful conclusion to the talks would be good news for both sides and inject some much-needed confidence in the global economic outlook. 
Whether or not they are willing to acknowledge it, both economies have already felt the effects from their exchange of trade blows, and the prevailing mood in both countries has been that worse is yet to come. 
But while they struck a more conciliatory tone, it remains to be seen whether or to what extent Pompeo's remarks represent a break from the previous stance expressed by various Trump administration officials, including himself. 
From US Vice-President Mike Pence to National Security Advisor John Bolton, we have heard on numerous occasions the dogmatic assessment that China is a rival that needs to be countered on every front. 
But rather than the now-familiar chip-on-the-shoulder message from Washington that the US will go it alone because everyone is out to get it, Pompeo's remarks on Tuesday hinted at a more community-aware, less of a social-misfit approach to relations with other countries. 
As he said with regard to China: ""There are those who say that a superpower conflict between our countries is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We want to find places where we can work together."" 
Adding the two countries can ""thrive and prosper together"", a message that China has repeatedly tried to get across to an administration that up to now has been hard of hearing. 
And it is a message that Beijing is backing up with actions. Washington needs to do the same. 
If what Pompeo told the WEF gathering does indicate a change in approach by Washington, it will definitely herald a brighter future for both peoples, and offer some reason for optimism at what has otherwise been a bleak start to the year. 
For as the past 40 years of diplomatic relations have proved, differences can be overcome as long as there is the shared will.

 It was reported on Tuesday that the United States will proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. 
Canada did what the US asked of it in detaining Meng without considering whether it was proper or not to do, so it is anticipated that it will carry on doing the US' bidding, even though its use of long-arm jurisdiction in this way is highly problematic. 
If Canada does continue to do what is required of it by the US, it will certainly see its relations with China, including its trade relations, further deteriorate, since it has the choice not to carry out the extradition of Meng on what are trumped-up charges. 
Canada has exacerbated the problem it has created for itself by seeking to establish a connection between China's arrest of two Canadians with its own holding of Meng, despite none existing. China has explained that what the two Canadians were doing posed a threat to its national security. 
It is even more ridiculous for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to claim that China arbitrarily handed out the death penalty to a Canadian citizen after a local Chinese court sentenced Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death for drug trafficking. Schellenberg was caught trying to smuggle more than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine to Australia, a crime that carries the death penalty according to China's Criminal Law. As does operating an international drug-trafficking operation, a separate charge that Schellenberg was also found guilty of. 
Huawei, because of its success as one of the world's largest smartphone makers and telecommunications equipment providers, has become a convenient lightning rod for US anxiety about China's growing technological might. It has spared no efforts in demonizing the Chinese company and even persuaded other countries, its allies in particular, not to use Huawei's products. 
The risk of Huawei's products being used for spying is simply a pretext; the US has never found any evidence to support this allegation. However, it has found allies such as Canada that are willing to go along with its pressure tactics against the Chinese company, for reasons of their own. 
By detaining Meng at the request of the US, Canada is acting as an accomplice in the US attempt to squeeze the space for China's technological advancement by containing the development of its telecoms pacemaker and even killing the company. 
Canada should be ashamed of what it has done with Meng, and realize that it will be the biggest loser if it continues to be the US yes-man.

 There has been growing worry in recent years that China's population may have started to decrease, leading to a rapidly aging society. However, figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday suggest that is a pessimistic view, as there were 15.23 million new births last year, meaning the population grew by 3.81 percent to 1.395 billion. 
And among the new births many are a second child, which indicates that the change to the country's family planning policy in 2016 to allow all couples to have a second child has proved effective in encouraging more births. 
Also that the workforce — those aged 16 to 59 — stands at around 900 million, or nearly 65 percent of China's total population, suggests there are still years to come before the country ceases to reap its demographic dividend, which has often been described as one of the major factors behind China's miraculous economic growth over the past four decades and was one of the reasons for the prescient change in policy. 
This, in addition to higher quality workers, as more than 8 million college graduates enter the job market each year, all bodes well for the country's industrial upgrading and economic growth in the long run. 
But the latest figures do reveal some cause for concern. That the number of new births last year was much lower than the 17.23 million in 2017 and 17.86 million in 2016 suggests a declining curve in new births that will be hard to reverse. 
This means more measures other than the all-couples two-child policy are needed to encourage young couples to give birth to a second child, whose willingness to do so is severely dampened by the costs involved in raising children. The measures should include more child care and early child development services, so as to relieve the burden on parents, as well as strengthened protection of women's employment rights. 
The fast aging population now poses a big challenge to China, as the number of people aged 60 years or above accounts for 17.9 percent of the total population, compared with 12 percent only 10 years ago. The proportion is expected to rise to 40 percent by 2050. 
To turn the problem into opportunities, the government must heed the alarm bell and make sure it is well prepared with new strategies such as building a well-developed social security system, improved welfare institutions and healthcare centers.

 Despite growing at the lowest rate in nearly three decades given the complicated domestic and external situation, that China's GDP growth was 6.6 percent last year highlights the resilience of the world's second-largest economy, which remains one of the fastest-growing major economies and the largest contributor to growth of the world economy. 
Admittedly, on a quarterly basis, the economy grew 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, down from the rise of 1.6 percent posted in the third quarter, and economic indicators such as industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment, all weakened last year, especially in the second half, prompting concerns that the trade dispute with the United States has begun to bite. 
However, considering the sheer size of the economy — over 90 trillion yuan ($13.26 trillion) — it is to be expected that its growth rate should slow after decades of nearly double-digit expansion, especially at a time when protectionism is on the rise and the country is making ongoing efforts to restructure the economy to make its growth more sustainable. 
Activity-dampening measures, such as cutting excessive production capacity and the closure of polluting factories, have inevitably proved a drag on the Chinese economy, but sacrificing speed for higher quality growth is necessary to secure sustainable growth in the long run. 
Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, on Monday listed some of the recent progress China has made in its restructuring efforts: Consumption and the service sector have become the two pillars of the economy, manufacturing technology upgrading is making solid progress and new growth engines, such as e-commerce, have emerged and are expanding. 
It will take time for the restructuring of such a large economy to fully take shape. But China is clearly making headway in its ongoing efforts to make the economy more efficient and growth more sustainable. 
While the China-US trade dispute has hit investor confidence in the Chinese economy and dampened domestic trade-related activities, thus slowing growth, there is optimism that the ongoing negotiations will result in a deal. Even if the dispute is prolonged, China has plenty of room for policy adjustments and will do so as necessary to mitigate the effects and cope with the challenges. 
And knowing that it is in the best interests of the country and its people, the country's leaders have indicated repeatedly that they are resolved to adhere to the course of reform and opening-up. While adopting targeted loosening policies, such as monetary easing to support the real economy, China will also deepen reforms in various fields to encourage competition, protect intellectual property rights, expand access for all types of investors and open its doors wider. 
As the data show, the country has the foundation, conditions and capability to keep economic growth within a reasonable range, and ensure sustained and healthy economic development.

"Trump-Kim meeting must avoid going round in circles: China Daily editorial","

 There is no guarantee that the announced second meeting the top leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will produce anything substantive, or live up to either side's – or the rest of the world's – expectations. 
But that should not prevent us from accepting the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un as another step forward. At least in the sense of keeping the denuclearization process alive. 
Despite worries that the United States president's eagerness for a ""win"" may undermine US strategic interests, it may be essential for opening up a new phase featuring meaningful interaction. 
Trump needs something worth boasting about as he is under pressure from the partial government shutdown over the funding for his wall on the border with Mexico and the ""Russian connection"" investigation. But Kim also needs a positive outcome, as the DPRK's economy continues to suffer under United Nations sanctions, which simultaneously constrain his rapid détente with the Republic of Korea. 
Considering that shared eagerness, the question then becomes whether, or to what extent, Trump and Kim can break the current stalemate at their coming summit. 
That the US president agreed to a second summit following a face-to-face meeting with the DPRK's top denuclearization negotiator Kim Yong-chol should be a signal he at least has an idea about what the next steps will be. A second summit ending without any tangible outcomes will put himself in an even more awkward position. 
But for this meeting to be productive, the two parties will have to demonstrate a shared political will to get real about what they promised last time. 
Things may easily return to the apparently circular quarrel over what constitutes meaningful moves, or reciprocity. That is precisely what this summit should strive to tackle. Without breaking that endless circle, denuclearization negotiations will go nowhere. 
For the summit to be worthwhile, the two leaders must make serious endeavors to bridge the gap between their governments' stances on how denuclearization should proceed. Washington's desire for swift, independently verifiable, irreversible denuclearization has proven unrealistic. Pyongyang's calls for reciprocity remain unanswered. 
Since Pyongyang has gone the extra mile to prove its sincerity, Washington must consider beginning to reciprocate. 
Since denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula appears increasingly likely to be a phased process, it would do no harm to any party for that process to start with the formal ending of the nominal state of war. 
That is a very low-cost way to attain a feat of potentially historic importance.

"Building walls mentality will only lead to confrontation: China Daily editorial","

 Although it is said to be beyond the Pentagon's technical and scientific capacity, which is what grounded most of Reagan administration's “Star Wars” initiative, some people might ask what it is wrong with US President Donald Trump talking about building an impenetrable missile shield to defend all US territory from ballistic missile threats. 
But such an anti-ballistic missile defense system can be compared to a wall in the space, and is yet another manifestation of the philosophy behind all the policies his administration has put forward and implemented on all fronts — hunkering down behind walls. 
When it comes to trade with other countries, even with its allies, his administration has built a wall of tariffs as a barrier to prevent imports from other countries. And he insists on building a wall on the border with Mexico. 
Instead of stepping out to engage with the international community, his administration is trying to hide the United States behind walls, in the belief that it is making the US an impenetrable fortress. In doing so it feels safe and superior not having to get along with anyone else, and so it is quite happy to lob stones over the walls. 
When it comes to Trump's plan of missile defense system which is envisioned as being able to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any US target, it is obvious that it is targeted at Russia and China, as clarified in the 81-page Missile Defense Review that was released by the Pentagon. 
Given that the US is very likely to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was signed by the US and Soviet Union in 1987, the US is clearly trying to adopt a confrontational approach in handling of relations with Russia and China. 
With the Trump administration pushing too hard on all fronts without leaving room for talks, it is not hard to imagine how Russia and China will have to act in response. And it is very likely that a new round of arms race will start. 
Given that some US strategists view the arms race the Reagan administration instigated with the Soviet Union as being the reason for the Soviet bloc's breakup, and given that the Reagan administration seems to have written the playbook for the current administration, the intent is clear. 
But things are not as they were then. 
The Trump administration should heed the adage about being careful what you wish for, before trying to create another Cold War. 
Certainly, such a scenario is the last thing the majority of countries and people around the world would like to see.

"Why doesn't US ditch zero-sum mentality in African development?","

          When US National Security Adviser John Bolton was laying out the new US strategy for Africa, which he announced on Dec 13, his primary concern was not about helping African countries with their economic and social development, but rather about countering China and Russia to advance the United States' selfish geopolitical goals. 
Such a zero-sum mentality of a US politician came as no surprise. Former US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, and incumbent Vice-President Mike Pence have all labeled China's investment in, and trade with, Africa as ""predatory"" or ""debt trap"", or as tools of ""neocolonialism"". 
Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, has endorsed Bolton's remarks. In a National Review article, titled ""The Coming Scramble in Africa"", Herman argues that China and Russia are ahead of the game to a degree, but the US has the advantage going forward. Like Bolton, Herman is neither a China expert nor an Africa expert, and therefore sees everything China does as bad and a threat to the US. 
However skilled these people may be in waging a smear campaign against China, facts speak louder than words. Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is a leading authority in the field. And she gives China credit while pointing out its problems, unlike some pundits who only have a one-sided view: Everything China does is bad, and when bad things happen, it must be China's fault. 
Brautigam recently told The East African, a Kenyan newspaper, that successive US policymakers ""have been spreading myths and rumors about what the Chinese are doing"" in Africa, as during her four-year in-depth study on China, she found ""no evidence at all"" to support the US government's depiction of China as a stealthy ""villain"" intent on ""sucking"" Africa's blood. 
Contrary to the US charge, she argued that China does not typically give loans at high interest rates to African countries that it knows have little chance of repaying their debt. Rather, China varies its lending rates in accordance with its assessment of the African countries' repayment capabilities. 
She noted that the US and other Western governments have also invested and lent to African governments with egregious record of repression and corruption. Warning against the Cold War mentality of US politicians, Brautigam said the Trump administration lacks the means to implement the ""Prosper Africa"" plan which Bolton boasted. 
Compared with the US, which has long treated Africa as a continent that needs handouts, China, thanks to its experience of four decades of reform and opening-up, sees a promising future for Africa in helping lift people out of poverty and supporting it to achieve rapid economic and social development. 
That's why China surpassed the US in trade with Africa in 2009. In fact, China's trade with Africa shot up to $170 billion in 2017, three times the US trade volume. Chinese companies have been building infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and power grids because Beijing knows infrastructure is essential to maintain as well as accelerate economic growth. 
Bolton and some US pundits and media outlets have also alleged the People's Liberation Army logistics support base in Djibouti poses a threat to the nearby US military base. This claim is an example of sheer paranoia and beyond logic given the US' military might and its 800-plus military bases across the world. 
At a seminar in Madrid last month, Chinese and European experts and former officials pointed to the huge potential China and European countries would have if they joined hands in third markets such as Africa and Latin America. 
That's the sort of healthy and win-win mentality people like Bolton badly need to cultivate.
