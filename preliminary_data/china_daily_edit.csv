"Huawei victim of Washington's compulsive, obsessive disorder: China Daily editorial",2/26/2019,"                          The logo of Huawei is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 26, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   The war waged by the United States against China's telecommunications company Huawei has been absurd from the very beginning. Yet the allegation that Huawei is a cybersecurity risk continues to be bandied about by Washington as if it is a fact, despite even its allies pouring cold water on its claims.  What happened at the world's biggest mobile industry trade fair, which opened in Barcelona on Monday, shows how determined the US is to push its absurdity to the extreme.  The big US government delegation at the show was clearly not there for the purpose of promoting the advancement of the telecom industry worldwide. Instead, it is intent on setting obstacles in its way. The US has seized the opportunity to continue its campaign against Huawei by trying to lean on the attending telecom executives and the government officials so they will turn their backs on the Chinese company.  Resorting to the now discredited claims the Chinese company represents a security concern above and beyond any other network provider, 11 US senators urged the US government on Monday to ban solar power inverters or advanced control systems made by Huawei, alleging that they pose a national security threat to US energy infrastructure. Yet, as before, the US has failed to produce any shred of evidence to support its allegations.  Although the aspersions the US is casting on Huawei are intended to harm the Chinese company, they also harm the interests of the US' international partners, which would otherwise be benefiting from conducting normal cooperation with the company.  As a global telecom giant that leads the world in 5G technology, Huawei could make huge contributions to the industrial development of countries and benefit consumers worldwide with its products. Industry experts have already pointed out countries that yield to the US pressure will be delaying their rollout of 5G by at least two years.  Huawei is clearly under huge pressure from the world's sole superpower, but it will survive the attacks, since it has established trust with its existing customers. It has already stated its willingness to participate in fact-based, risk-assessment reviews, and it has already set up a security risk evaluation center of its own, based in Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom.  It is no secret that Washington's pummeling of Huawei stems from the US administration's intention to suppress China's advancement in science and technology. But there is the possibility that the US administration might finally have caught on to the fact it is trying to flog a dead horse to those seeking a reasonably priced thoroughbred. The US president said last week that he wanted the US to catch up in the 5G race through competition, ""not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies"".  Network operators will be crossing their fingers that this heralds a change of approach. Although, by displaying its paranoia about Huawei, Washington has laid bare just how pathologically it fears losing its perch at the top of the tech tree and how little confidence it has that it can make up the lost ground.

US should not let Tsai lead it by the nose: China Daily editorial,2/26/2019,"                          Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen attends a news conference in Taipei April 11, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Two US Navy vessels passed through the Taiwan Straits on Monday, less than a week after the island's leader Tsai Ing-wen claimed the Chinese mainland posed a military threat to the island in an interview with CNN. Whatever the rationale the United States might be using to justify the move, Tsai and her followers will very likely try to portray it as the US responding to her claim that the mainland is challenging the island's ""independent existence"".  Both she and Washington know the island has no such thing. It is Tsai who is dangerously playing with fire, emboldened by the ill-considered support offered her by Washington.  Since she took office as leader of the island, Tsai has stubbornly refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. In doing so, she has plunged cross-Straits relations into their worst crisis in many years.  By holding to their ambition to realize the island's separation from the motherland, Tsai and the Democratic Progressive Party have been losing the support of Taiwan people. The defeat Tsai and her party suffered in the local elections on the island in 2018 speaks volumes about how stranded and isolated they are in their delusion.  Tsai showed how divorced from reality she is, when she announced last week that she would stand for reelection in 2020, despite the vote of no confidence she received in the local elections.  The farther Tsai and her party go in their attempts to separate the island from the motherland the more they distance themselves from the prevailing sentiment among residents on the island, and the more they test the limit of the mainland's tolerance.  The sailing through the Taiwan Straits by the two US naval vessels serves Tsai's purpose, as it helps to obscure the truth of the cross-Straits situation, which is that in seeking to ""finish her agenda"", she is the one who poses the threat to peace and stability.  Provoking the Chinese mainland and exaggerating the threat from it are Tsai's way of trying to shift the blame to the mainland for the consequences of her actions.  In this endeavor, it is important for Tsai that she has recourse to the US, as she needs it to bolster her bravado.  Washington knows what Taiwan means to the Chinese mainland, and therefore, it should understand the high hopes that Tsai pins on it. It should not get dragged into Tsai's schemes, as US-China relations will be the collateral damage if it blithely colludes with her artifice.         "
Crucial support for change in peninsula situation: China Daily editorial,2/25/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   As Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un and United States President Donald Trump prepare to meet in Hanoi on Wednesday and Thursday, it is worth reflecting on what has been achieved since Pyongyang and Seoul first broke the ice ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in the Republic of Korea in February last year.  Even the most skeptical would have to admit that the whirlwind series of meetings after that initial thaw in relations — which included two meetings between Kim and President Xi Jinping, and culminated in the historic first meeting between the sitting leaders of the DPRK and US in Singapore in June — was really quite remarkable.  Despite any claims to the contrary, there has been a sea change in the Korean Peninsula situation over the past year.  It is now up to Kim and Trump to keep the good momentum going and make the doomsayers eat their words by producing some end product in Hanoi.  Of course, goodwill will need to be reciprocal for that. Prior to his departure for Hanoi, Trump said he was in no rush and had no pressing schedule for Pyongyang's denuclearization, suggesting a more accommodative position on the more gradual approach that the DPRK has long favored. He has also signaled a possible softening of his stance on sanctions, saying they could be removed if there is meaningful progress on denuclearization.  Kim, on his part, said in his New Year speech that he wanted ""corresponding practical actions"" from the US.  All this has built up expectations that the two leaders will agree on concrete actions that can bridge the deep-rooted animosity and mistrust that have long existed between the two arch enemies.  But the crux of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue remains the security guarantee that Pyongyang seeks and which Washington has refused to give. If that guarantee is forthcoming and the US is willing to assist the DPRK in its efforts to promote economic development, beginning with the lifting of sanctions, there is no reason for Pyongyang not to focus on needed economic development.  It has not been easy for the Korean Peninsula peace process to have got this far, and China has been making great efforts to sustain the momentum that had been threatening to stall. Trump acknowledged this in a tweet on Sunday when he said Xi has ""been very helpful in his support"" of the Hanoi meeting.  China hopes Pyongyang and Washington will seize this opportunity to further promote peace and stability on the peninsula.         "
UK has more than enough reason to maintain good ties with China: China Daily editorial,2/24/2019,"                          The London skyline seen from Victoria Tower at sunset. [Photo/VCG]   That a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday that a visit by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is welcome sends a positive message about the country's willingness to have sound relations with the United Kingdom.  Clearly Downing Street has done enough to smooth over the remarks of British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson early this month about sending the UK's new aircraft to the South China Sea, which former Conservative chancellor George Osborne rightly described as ""gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind"".  Sending a warship to the Pacific is of no strategic importance to the UK, except to send a message to the United States that it is still its close ally and will follow where it leads. It may also harbor the belief that sending its naval white elephant to parade up and down the South China Sea -- as part of what the US likes to call freedom of navigation missions -- somehow recalls the days when the Royal Navy granted the UK an overbearing sense of self-importance.  China has reiterated time and again that it has done nothing to restrict freedom of navigation in the waters and it has no intention of doing so. But Western navies seem to view the sea as a playground in which they can intimidate China.  The UK's willingness to be part of the gang showing the West's military muscle in the South China Sea will undoubtedly be detrimental to its otherwise close economic ties with China, which will not tolerate any move by any country to challenge its sovereignty and territory integrity.  British exports to and imports from China hit a record high in 2017. China was Britain's sixth largest export market that year with sales worth 22.3 billion pounds ($29.15 billion), and its fourth largest source of imports worth 45.2 billion pounds, according to the House of Commons Library.  Given the current difficulties the UK faces with its shilly-shallying over the best way to leave the European Union, and the real possibility of a no-deal exit looming ever closer, Downing Street should well know how important sound ties with China are.  To maintain healthy bilateral ties with non-EU countries is the best way for the UK to navigate itself out of the difficulties of its own making. It should be giving ties with China, the world's second largest economy, an important position in its diplomacy.  And since China and the UK both advocate free trade and multilateralism, there is a good foundation for the two countries to build on.  But that calls for more discerning diplomacy from the Downing Street, otherwise it will continue to shoot itself in the foot.         "
Extended talks raise hopes there's a deal in the offing: China Daily editorial,2/24/2019,"                          A fresh round of high-level economic and trade talks between China and the US is held the Eisenhower Executive Office Building of the White House in Washington DC, the US, on Feb 21, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   The extending of the talks between China and the United States to resolve their trade and economic frictions will hopefully give substance to the optimism expressed by both sides that they can reach a deal.  US President Donald Trump, senior US officials, and Vice-Premier Liu He, the special envoy of President Xi Jinping, who is heading the Chinese delegation, all expressed the belief on Friday that the two sides have made significant progress toward reaching a comprehensive agreement that will put an end to the current trade standoff.  It is to be expected that the discussions at this stage will be the toughest test yet for the two teams of negotiators, and their task is not one to be envied. However, the unscheduled two-day extension to their discussions indicates that tangible headway is being made in their joint efforts to find a mutually acceptable way to resolve their differences and put an end to their quarrel.  Given what was said on Friday, it seems the talks have gone more deeply and extensively into the bilateral relationship than either side initially anticipated. As US President Donald Trump observed, ""we're covering things that we didn't even know we'd be covering.""  So the fact that the to-and-fro is still in progress this far down the line highlight that there is a shared desire to secure an accord that delivers on the rapport that has been established — also perhaps beyond both side's expectations.  But it would be getting ahead of the situation to consider the final push toward a consensus on principled, mutually beneficial cooperation all done and dusted. That consensus, which President Xi identified as the objective of the talks when he met with the US negotiators after the previous round of negotiations in Beijing, has still not been completed, and probably will not be until the two leaders meet to agree on the final details. But there is no doubt that both sides are aware of how momentous such a consensus would be, beyond the tangible rewards it would offer both countries. For if the two sides can iron out their core differences by abiding by the principles of mutual respect and mutual benefit, it would reset their relationship in a way that would bode well for the future.  History in the past four decades shows that the two countries benefit in an all-around way from harmonious trade and economic relations, as they provide the ballast for their relationship.  There is obviously still more work to be done. However, if neither side puts a foot wrong, a deal will finally be signed sooner or later.            "
No block to future a smarter approach: China Daily editorial,2/22/2019,"                          [Photo/VCG]   Time and tide wait for no one. And neither does technology as we rush pell-mell toward a brave new world of artificial intelligence and things talking to things.  And there is much to be gained, economically and otherwise, by being able to rule this much-heralded smart roost.  As the White House has put it: In the information age, the nation that leads the world in wireless technology wins.  Which is why it has been trying to incapacitate China's 5G technology leader Huawei.  Even though, as Andreas Maierhofer, the CEO of T-Mobile Poland, said at a news conference on Thursday, excluding Huawei, which is the market leader in 5G technology, will delay the ushering in of next generation wireless networks.  Which is why the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Germany have snubbed Washington's invitation to join it in its efforts to debilitate Huawei. It is not, as the United States seems to believe, because of its allies' lack of allegiance, but rather their practical needs to embrace the new technology, for which the United States can offer no substitute provider.  That Washington cannot recommend any US companies that can step into the breach is a cause of extreme concern to it, and that is at the heart of its complaints against Huawei and its attacks on China's technology and innovation drive.  However, against this background of competition, it seems the intensive discussions between the US and China over the past two and a half months, may have enabled the US to heed at least a little reason. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump set out a more fair-minded approach by tweeting that the US should win leadership in 5G through competition, ""not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies"".  Although it is perhaps too early to anticipate an end to the US attacks on Huawei, the tweet is an encouraging sign to all parties that change might be in the air.  Hopefully, having realized that fair competition is better than resorting to underhand tricks to hobble a rival, Washington will be able to go one step further, and turn what it views as a crisis into what it really is — an opportunity to strengthen cooperation in technology and innovation with countries, including China, so as to create new impetus for shared development and mutual benefits.  As the world stands ready to step across the threshold into the world of 5G; this is no time to be squabbling over who goes first, countries should embrace the imminent arrival of ubiquitous connectivity as an opportune time to become closer to one another rather than turning it into a divisive moment.  However, that is to optimistically look ahead and still far removed from things as they stand, because until there is some noticeable convergence between the sentiment in Trump's tweet and his administration's practice, Huawei is likely to remain disappointed even in its hope for ""real competition"", never mind cooperation.

Australia's anti-China stance proves fertile ground for racism: China Daily editorial,2/21/2019,"                          Senator Barry O'Sullivan looks on as the debate takes place on the marriage equality bill in the Senate at Parliament House on November 29, 2017 in Canberra, Australia. [Photo/VCG]   Except for himself, no one knows what triggered Australian Nationals' senator Barry O'Sullivan's outburst of racial invective against the Chinese on Tuesday. During a Senate estimates hearing over the proposed Biosecurity Imports Levy in Canberra, O'Sullivan declared that ""some bloody old Chinaman"" bringing in ""his favorite sausage down the front of his undies"" poses more risk to Australia's biosecurity than levy-paying importers.  Such disgusting remarks, which are definitely unacceptable in any civilized society, have naturally sparked the ""sternest"" condemnation from the Chinese embassy in Australia. Even the Australian Human Rights Commission's race discrimination commissioner has termed O'Sullivan's comments as ""racially derogatory"", and said they would be ""offensive and insulting to many Australians, including more than 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage"".  But this is not the first time that O'Sullivan has courted controversy with such offensive remarks. He has previously been criticized for making sexist comments about a Greens senator, and sparked outrage for voicing an ""appalling and offensive"" slur against people with autism. The fact that the prejudiced politician can continue staging ugly political stunts by going to the extremes throughout the years is a disgrace to democracy, and reflects an ugly side of Australia's political culture.  But it is not completely coincidental that racial filth like that made by O'Sullivan should make its way into Australia's major political arena. Canberra's increasingly anti-China stance, especially after it introduced national security laws to guard against what it perceives as China's growing influence in Australia's politics, academia and media, has certainly fanned xenophobia that targets China and the Chinese people.  Australia's decision to block Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from supplying equipment to its 5G broadband network, and allusions by some Australian media and politicians that China is the ""state actor"" behind the recent hacking of the networks of Australia's major political parties indicate how closely Canberra is trying to toe the line set by Washington, even at the cost of its relations with China.  This sounds absurd to any person of reason, for China has never done any harm and poses no threat to Australia. As its largest trading partner, China is the top importer of Australia's iron ore, liquefied natural gas and many other resources, which is mutually beneficial to the economic growth of both countries.  Given his outrageous political history, it might not be realistic to expect O'Sullivan to mend his ways and behave civilly. But it is still not too late for Canberra to rethink its policy toward China to avoid causing more damage to bilateral relations.         "
Tsai paints false picture of situation in Asia: China Daily editorial,2/21/2019,"                          Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan, China, Jan 5, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's warning that the Chinese mainland poses a threat to Asia is nothing more than her whistling past a graveyard.  Speaking to CNN this week, she said that if countries in the region were not willing to submit to the will of the Chinese mainland they would face similar threats to those made against the island.  It is preposterous for Tsai to describe the Chinese mainland as being despotic in its relations with its Asian neighbors, and to imagine that in doing so those countries will stand behind her pro-independence stance.  By trying to portray herself as standing in the front ranks of those resisting a threat from the Chinese mainland, she was painting a picture of the situation in Asia that does not exist.  The true picture, which she is trying to obscure, is that her administration is becoming increasingly isolated in the world.  Indeed, it is not only internationally, Tsai and the Democratic Progressive Party are also losing their support on the island as well. It is only in the picture she is painting that the Chinese mainland is a threat. But having alienated Beijing with their insistence on Taiwan independence, Tsai and the DPP are now reaping the consequences of their actions.  The trouncing she and the DPP suffered in the local elections in 2018 points to the fact that Taiwan people are fed up with her policy of estranging the island from the Chinese mainland.  Yes, the Chinese mainland has never excluded and it will never renounce the option of using military means to realize reunification. But that does not pose a threat to the Chinese compatriots on the island, only to those secessionists who harbor the ill intention of splitting the island from the motherland.  It is Tsai's refusal to recognize the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China that has spoiled the otherwise good relations across the Taiwan Straits since her election as the leader on the island in 2016.  Tsai has declared that she will stand for reelection in 2020. But she should know that she will hardly be accepted by the Taiwan people unless she changes her stance and acknowledges the one-China principle, as this is the only way any leader on the island can ensure economic prosperity and social progress for the people on the island.  In her interview with CNN, Tsai said she wanted to ""complete"" her vision for Taiwan. But her lack of support on the island, and even within the DPP, shows how out of touch with reality she is.         "
Decisive talks must be forward-thinking: China Daily editorial,2/20/2019,"                          [Photo/VCG]   China and the United States began their latest round of trade talks in Washington on Tuesday, with principal-level discussions led by Vice-Premier Liu He, who is President Xi Jinping's special envoy, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scheduled for Thursday and Friday.  The negotiations, which follow those in Beijing last week — after which both sides claimed that progress had been made — will hopefully demonstrate the two countries have the shared desire and sincerity to make a final push to prevent their dispute from escalating.  Both sides should cherish the narrowing of their differences that has been achieved, as it has involved more than just the picking of low-hanging fruit.  So far, the markets have been quite optimistic about the prospects of a deal. Especially, after US President Donald Trump sent a conciliatory signal by saying he might extend the March 1 deadline that would trigger further tariffs on Chinese imports if the two sides are near agreement.  But as the recent series of talks have shown, it would be naive to think that such a Gordian knot of differing goals and ambitions will be simple to unravel, especially as the discussions are now about the most divisive and touch-a-nerve issues.  Since the consensus was reached between Xi and Trump on Dec 1 that the two sides should talk through their issues as it was in both countries' interests, an outline for future relations has begun to take shape. And there is clearly the potential for those looking back on these talks from the future to see them as milestone moment in relations between the two countries, whether for better or worse.  Those without an ideological ax to grind will be hoping it is the former. However, any agreement will only be workable if both sides are rational and pragmatic about the other's concerns and interests; it cannot be exclusively beneficial to only one party.  Which means that Washington needs to be realistic about what China can and cannot do. If a deal is not to come apart at the seams as soon as it is struck it will need to take into account the bigger picture. Not least the fact that Washington may be able to hobble China's development to some degree or other but it will not be able to stop it. Reaching a mutually acceptable deal is also the most beneficial outcome for the US.  Both sides, therefore, should adhere to a problem-solving approach this week and continue to seek to strengthen their mutual trust. Because one thing that has been gained so far is a better understanding of one another. They now need to leverage that into the discernment of knowing that friendly relations serve both their interests best.         "
Promise of 'exciting' summit raises hopes of real peace: China Daily editorial,2/20/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Since last year, after the leaders of the two Koreas first set it in motion, a strong momentum of conciliation and engagement has eased the tensions over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear issue.  True, since last year's historic meeting with DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, US President Donald Trump has been under growing pressure at home, as critics say the meeting produced little of substance. And Kim had just begun to show a little impatience that his signaled change of focus from the development of nuclear weapons to economic development had not been met with accommodative actions from Washington until his request for a second meeting was met.  Dialogue between the two long antagonistic countries is clearly the way to put an end to their acrimony. So the fact that both sides have shown patience and good faith offers some reassurance that their get-together was not just a flash-in-the-pan meeting-of-minds and that fresh impetus can be attained in their upcoming face-to-face talks.  But concrete outcomes from their meeting — due to take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, next week — will be crucial to keep the process of engagement on track and moving forward.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that Trump's remark on Tuesday that he had ""no pressing time schedule"" for results on denuclearization are an acceptance that denuclearization will be a step-by-step, tit-for-tat process rather than a bid to exert pressure on Pyongyang by suggesting Washington can play a longer game.  Admittedly, his prediction that it would be ""very exciting"" suggests that something is in the works, with the possibility of a peace deal being mooted. Which would certainly be a historic achievement, and a very welcome one at that. The use-by date on the armistice that brought a cessation to the fighting on the peninsula in 1953 should have expired long ago with a final peace settlement.  Yet it is also to be hoped that by saying he is in ""no rush"", he does not intend to drag the process out and keep the bad blood simmering so that Washington can continue to claim there is a threat from Pyongyang as justification for its overbearing military presence in the region and for housing its missile defense systems in the Republic of Korea and Japan.  Whatever he might have meant, however, there are expectations that next week's meeting will reward the efforts of the international community, notably the ROK and China, to end the antagonism between the US and the DPRK through conciliation.  Given the complexity of the DPRK nuclear issue, it is unrealistic to anticipate the goal of denuclearization can be met through a couple of high-level meetings. But it is surely not too much to hope the two sides can keep the denuclearization ball visibly moving with some tangible give and take.         "
US won't make progress while it's stuck in the past: China Daily editorial,2/19/2019,"                          US Vice-President Mike Pence is seen outside Hotel Bayerischer Hof during Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Feb 16, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   ""We're advancing the interests of the free world, and we've made great progress,"" is how US Vice-President Mike Pence summed up the US administration's stance and his presence at the Munich Security Conference.  Had he taken into consideration the feelings of his audience, he would have shown a little modesty. Since it seemed that most of those listening felt differently.  No. We are not talking about the silence following his announcement that he brought greetings direct from the White House. Although, this has been taken to sensational levels in less-than-friendly media presentations.  Or the lengthy applause German Chancellor Angela Merkel drew following her defense of the European approach to international affairs, which is in sharp contrast to that of the United States.  Or the standing ovation Pence's predecessor, Joe Biden, won upon declaring ""America will be back"". Even though we never saw the US leave. Perhaps Biden was hinting at some future scenario. Although we didn't hear him say that.  So we need help to see the ""great progress"" the US vice-president boasted of. Because what the rest of world saw from the Munich gathering was further evidence that there is a huge divergence between Washington and its traditional European allies, on almost all outstanding concerns on their respective foreign policy agendas.  While it may be an exaggeration to conclude that Pence deepened the divisions. He did highlight the widening gap between the once very close allies. From the Iran nuclear deal to Russia, Venezuela, and Syria, the current US administration is at loggerheads with its European allies. Fundamentally, they are at odds on how international affairs should be approached.  As was evident in Munich, their disparities extend beyond approaches to values. That Pence called for Europe to scrap the Iran nuclear deal and Merkel gave a determined defense of it, served as vivid illustration of the divide in diplomatic philosophies between Europe and the US under the current US administration. Merkel advocated continuous commitment to multilateral approaches. Pence made clear Washington was not going to reconsider its insistence on US interests coming first and foremost and the devil take everyone else.  Merkel's appeal for the US to ""put yourself in the other's shoes … and see whether we can get win-win solutions together,"" therefore, will in all likelihood have fallen on deaf ears.  Despite Biden's observation that ""leadership only exists if somebody and others are with you"".  The White House probably doesn't care about the Pew Research Center survey that found an increasing number of Europeans, half the population in Germany and France, see US power as a threat.  But as the rest of the world demonstrates a growing willingness to show it a cold shoulder, the US may find that it is the one that's hindmost.         "
Once again Canberra's turn to hawk conspiracy theory: China Daily editorial,2/19/2019,"                          Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison arrives for APEC CEO Summit 2018 at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Nov 17, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It seems to be contagious — no sooner does one Western politician engage in some character assassination of China than another pops up to do the same.  The latest verbal bullets have been fired by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison who alleged on Monday that a ""sophisticated state actor"" was behind a cyberattack on the Australian Parliament's computing network.  Although he did not name it, it has been assumed that he was insinuating China was responsible, given this is not the first time that Canberra's anxiety-driven willingness to emulate Washington has prompted it to lay the responsibility for alleged spying at Beijing's door.  The prime minister also claimed that the network used by major political parties was subject to what he described as a ""malicious intrusion"" on Feb 8.  No matter whether he was assigning the malevolent acts to China or another country, it is irresponsible of him to cast aspersions in this way.  The world we are living in seems engulfed by conspiracy theories. And clearly some politicians, even some political leaders, are not averse to fueling them, even starting them.  Do they delight in the assumption that some powerful forces are perniciously working behind the scenes to curry favor with a credulous public, to cover up their own failings, or because they think they can leverage some tangible national advantage from it?  Whatever the reason, such ploys are an easy option as their perpetrators do not need any evidence to support the accusations. They simply voice their scurrilous claims, confident that their invective will stick in some impressionable minds.  Certainly it seems that when it comes to China, many Western politicians, have forgotten their professional ethics, as they appear to have no compunction about letting their tongues wag maliciously about a sovereign nation and its companies.  It is hard not to view the calumny as orchestrated. Western politicians seem willing to speak ill of China because they feel their countries are being elbowed aside as it rises. Even though China has never exerted any force to make room for itself and has invited them to accompany it on its journey of rejuvenation.  It is natural for people to feel anxious about changing circumstances over which they feel they have no control. But these conspiracy theories that portray China as aggressively seeking to infiltrate Western networks and societies hark back to the comic books of the 1950s and they are as far-fetched now as they were back then.

Hounding of Huawei a lowdown dirty trick: China Daily editorial,2/18/2019,"                          A 5G network in the railway station will be a key milestone in 5G commercial deployment across Shanghai. [Photo/IC]   In a slap in the face for the United States, which is seeking a blanket ban by European countries on equipment provided by the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, the British intelligence service has determined that using Huawei equipment does not pose a security threat.  Any possible risks arising from using Huawei technologies in 5G networks can be mitigated, according to a Financial Times report citing two sources familiar with the conclusion of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre.  In addition, the NCSC has never found evidence of malicious Chinese state cyber activity through Huawei despite repeated US accusations to that effect.  It is encouraging to hear some reason amid the jibber-jabber of US fearmongering. At the Munich Security Conference, US Vice-President Mike Pence on Saturday once again spuriously urged US allies to take seriously ""the threat"" posed by Huawei and other Chinese telecoms companies and exclude them from their markets.  But even if is repeated a thousand times or more, a lie will remain a lie. Indeed, more countries have come to realize that the US assertions that Chinese 5G network technology presents unacceptable security risks are pure nonsense, and the US targeting Huawei has nothing to do with security concerns, but because it finds it hard to come to terms with China becoming a global tech power.  The White House released its mission statement in October last year, declaring ""America will win the global race to 5G"". And it is clear that it is prepared to go to any lengths to force others off the track so it can reach the finishing line first.  Huawei is leading the development of 5G, while US companies are lagging behind in the competition. Huawei not only offers superior hardware, but also at lower price, which explains why it has shipped more than 10,000 5G base stations worldwide — and why it has become the target for Washington's dirty tricks.  With customers in 170 countries and regions, telecoms network operators worldwide have every reason to worry that excluding Huawei from market competition will disrupt the supply of equipment, increase costs to carriers and customers, and delay the rollout of next-generation 5G services.  That's why the GSM Association, which represents the interests of mobile network operators around the world, has called on European governments to join its members in establishing a testing regime to find out for themselves if Huawei poses any security threat, rather than be duped into joining the Washington-orchestrated hounding of Huawei.  The latest message from Britain's cyber security center should encourage European governments and mobile operators to base their decisions related to Huawei on technical expertise and evidence-based appraisal of risk, instead of ideological mania.

Greater Bay Area to be showcase for opening-up: China Daily editorial,2/18/2019,"                          The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. [Photo/Xinhua]   As one of the strategic city clusters — along with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development and the Yangtze River Economic Belt — that are intended to act as engines for the national economy and facilitate the nation's further opening-up, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a key component of the national development strategy for the next 30 years or so.  According to the outline of the development blueprint for the Greater Bay Area released on Monday, the main focus is to strengthen the cooperation among the three areas in order to turn the Greater Bay Area into a world-class innovation and technology hub and an efficient gateway between the mainland and the outside world, particularly those economies involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.  Encompassing nine cities in Guangdong province — Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen — along with the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, which have different political, legal, economic and customs systems, the plan calls for close cooperation and coordination to harness the collective strengths of the region, which is already the most prosperous and internationalized region in the country.  Rather than weakening the application of ""one country, two systems"" as some pundits have suggested, the outline of the development plan shows that the intention is to take advantage of these differences to boost the development of the bay area as whole.  Thus the plan aims to strengthen Guangdong's position as the nation's leading technology and industrial innovation center and reinforce its role as a pilot zone for reform and opening-up. And it seeks to not only consolidate Hong Kong's role as an offshore renminbi business hub and international financial center, but also to take advantage of its mature legal system to establish the SAR as legal and dispute resolution center for the Asia-Pacific. Macao is to likewise leverage its comparative advantage as an economic and trade cooperation platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as advancing its reputation as a global tourism and leisure center.  Now that the blueprint has provided the overall direction for coordinated development, all the cities, each of which has its unique role to play, should come up with their respective plans to work within the framework so as to achieve the goal of building a vibrant and innovative world-class bay area by 2022.  By fully leveraging their comparative advantages and enhancing the convergence and coordination of their policy and planning, the 11 cities can make the Greater Bay Area an even more dynamic region than it is now and a showcase for the nation's continuing reform and opening-up.

US increasingly isolated denying trend of the times: Editorial,2/18/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump gestures during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, US, February 12, 2019. [Photo/IC]   When German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, ""the question now is: do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?"" she was denouncing the unilateralism the United States has been pursuing since 2016.  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, she called on the United States to put itself in other countries' shoes and to pursue win-win solutions together.  That the warm applause she received was absent after the address by US Vice-President Mike Pence speaks volumes about how unwelcome the unilateralist policies the US has adopted are.  The US has withdrawn from the multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, announced it is quitting the Paris Agreement on climate change and repeatedly pointed accusing fingers at China, even its own allies, on anything it considers to be not in its own favor.  The US administration refers to the unilateral and isolationist policies it is pursuing with the euphemism ""America First"", and Pence tried to claim that ""does not mean America alone"". But the US is becoming increasingly isolated as it stands against the trend for cooperation in pursuit of shared peace and prosperity.  Instead of solving the common problems the world is facing, the US is standing on the wrong side of history trying to dictate to other countries in a hegemonic manner what they should do.  It seems as if it believes it is the very source of justice and fairness and thus entitled to lead the world in whatever manner it pleases. It is with this mentality that it wields the baton of sanctions against any country that it considers to be defying its will, or raises tariffs on imports from any country when it feels it is losing the trade competition with that country.  Wherever the US exerts its unilateral policies in the world, the situation is sure to become chaotic.  The situation in the Middle East has become much more volatile and complicated since the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.  It is increasing its pressure on the European Union to cut off its relations with Russia, which if the EU does, will increase the uncertainties and pose a threat to the stability of Europe.  Meanwhile the trade frictions it has instigated with China have seriously affected the development of the global economy. Its persistent persuasion of its allies not to use the equipment and services of China's telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for their 5G networks not only blocks the development of this world telecoms equipment maker. It will also have a negative impact on the development of the next generation telecoms network worldwide as the entire supply chain in this sector will be jeopardized.  Given the uncertainties the world faces, just as Chinese top diplomat Yang Jiechi said at the conference, the world needs multilateralism and cooperation more than at any other time. The world will only have more problems if unilateralism is not contained.         "
Zara 'insulting China'? Don't be so sensitive!,2/17/2019,"                          The model in the incident Li Jingwen. [Photo from Zara's website]   The costume and cosmetics brand Zara was recently in trouble because one of its advertisements, in which a female Chinese model appeared, was blamed for ""defaming the Chinese"".  The troublemaking advertisement was released on Friday on Zara's official website. Titled ""Beauty is here"", it stars a Chinese woman wearing the brand's clothes and aims to introduce new cosmetics.  Yet, after Zara shared it on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, in some of the comments it was noted that the model had freckles on her face, suggesting that by selecting her as the model, Zara might mean to ""defame the Chinese"", because a perfect face should be without any freckles. Some also added that the model in the photo didn't appear to be in a good, energetic mood.  ""Does Zara mean all Asian girls have freckles on their faces?"" Went one of the hottest comments on the Zara release.  ""Cannot believe they pick a freckled face on behalf of Asian females,"" said another. Some of the comments, deleted very soon after being posted, even guessed Zara might mean to ""insult"" China, as the Italian brand D&G did in November.  Yet the majority of the comments said they don't think Zara means any harm. ""It is OK for anyone to have a freckled face, so why cannot a model?"" was another one of the hottest comments.  On Saturday, Zara responded that it meant no harm. The company said photos of the model were taken in an all-natural way without any software manipulation, and the reactions might just be differences in aesthetics.  By Sunday evening, the hashtag #Zara responds about the Chinese model advertisement# had already been read 460 million times on Sina Weibo, making it one of the hottest of the day.  It might be understandable that those who complain about Zara's new advertisement might do so to prevent the nation's image from being hurt. However, their deeds show over-sensitivity and a lack of cultural confidence. It shows they are so afraid of being hurt that they tend to take a defense gesture against any move they do not understand.  Cultural confidence is just being promoted by the leadership of this country, and tolerance is an essential part of it. Only when we learn to tolerate each other in terms of aesthetic, will cultural confidence be owned by everyone.  Besides, the model in the incident, Li Jingwen, is famous, having worked professionally for a long time. To those who are unsatisfied with her freckled face, that might be hurtful to her, too, although they might not mean any harm. Let's hope tolerance can be promoted so that similar misunderstandings do not happen again.         "
UK's gunboat policy will likely sink its trade hopes: China Daily editorial,2/17/2019,"                          The London skyline seen from Victoria Tower at sunset. [Photo/VCG]   The incumbents of Downing Street and the United Kingdom Treasury are reportedly tearing their hair out at the injudicious words of the UK secretary of state for defense who has ruined a crucial trip by the chancellor of the exchequer to Beijing.  A trip considered ""a vital part"" of the United Kingdom's endeavors to cement global trading links as it struggles to bring home the bacon after Brexit. A trip that British media claim would be worth 10.2 billion pounds ($7.88 billion) over a five-year period.  The British Treasury has confirmed Philip Hammond, its chancellor, will not travel to Beijing, but it has sought to downplay the incident claiming ""No trip was ever announced or confirmed"".  Nonetheless preparations for that unannounced, unconfirmed visit were reportedly ""well advanced"". Until that is, British Secretary of State for Defense Gavin Williamson torpedoed it with his remarks in London on Feb 11.  In a speech titled ""Defense in Global Britain"" outlining the British military's future direction, Williamson announced he would dispatch the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific and that Britain was prepared to use ""lethal"" force to deter countries that ""flout international law"". That rhetoric was broadly read as a less-than-subtle threat to China in the South China Sea, given it echoed that of the United States when referring to its naval operations in those waters.  It should come as no surprise then that Beijing would have second thoughts about committing to any trade engagement.  London has obviously realized the damaging potential of Williamson's remarks. Downing Street distanced itself from the statements, saying Britain has ""a strong and constructive relationship"" with China.  George Osborne, the former British Tory chancellor, is surely not alone in finding the British government's China policy baffling.  ""You have got the defense secretary engaging in gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind at the same time as the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary are going around saying they want a close economic partnership with China,"" he told BBC Radio 4.  But of course the UK also wants a close economic partnership with the US and having spent 3.1 billion pounds on the warship, it needs to give it a purpose beyond the jingoistic nostalgia for a time when Britannia ruled the waves.  British officials were said to be in a ""frantic round of diplomacy"" to try to get talks back on track. But it will not be easy if its defense department insists on living in the past.  If Whitehall is determined to confront Beijing, it should not expect to profit from a warm relationship.         "

Promising progress needs pushing forward to a deal: China Daily editorial,2/15/2019,"                          President Xi Jinping (C) meets with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who are here for a new round of China-US high-level economic and trade consultations, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, Feb 15, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   Related:  President Xi meets US trade representative, treasury secretaryIn welcome news, it seems that the latest talks between China and the United States, which concluded on Friday, have further narrowed their differences and expanded their common ground on key trade and economic issues.  The two sides entered the two days of high-level talks on Thursday amid a flurry of positive signals that progress was being made. And it seems that their candid discussions have continued to be rewarded.  There has clearly been movement on a number of topics that have been the focus of their recent trade rows. Speaking to President Xi Jinping after the talks wrapped up, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the negotiators “feel we have made headway on very, very important and difficult issues”.  It is probably still too early to conclude that this heralds an end to the long-running trade dispute between the two countries, and it would be rash to be overly sanguine about the prospects for relations given Washington’s anxieties about China’s rise, which may simply be channeled in other ways. But the agreement between Xi and his US counterpart Donald Trump in December to press the pause button on frictions, and the subsequent intense series of discussions to find ways to stop them escalating, show both sides are aware of how damaging and potentially dangerous it would be to keep locking horns over their trade relations.  Hopefully, the discussions over the past three months have helped both sides to better understand each other’s concerns and fostered greater mutual trust.  That the feel-good atmosphere that has prevailed since the January discussions in Washington has been maintained by this round of talks was evident as the negotiations are to continue in the US capital next week. This welcome development was confirmed by Xi, who said he hoped the discussions would carry forward the positive momentum as it conformed to the interests of both countries to strengthen their cooperation.  Although it is probably too hasty to interpret from this that a deal is imminent given some of the US demands, it is to be hoped that the just-concluded negotiations have laid the groundwork for next week’s discussions to establish a framework for a resolution to the trade dispute, so that a meeting between Xi and Trump, which is regarded as necessary to finalize any deal, can be scheduled for this purpose as soon as possible.  New progress on the outstanding difficult issues is imperative as the trade frictions have not been good for either country, despite claims to the contrary.  The tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US so far have had a negative impact on the Chinese economy, but it has shown resilience in coping with the shocks, and the repercussions have not been as severe as predicted. In January, for instance, Chinese exports rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 3.5 percent decline in December, according to customs data released on Thursday. And although its export growth to the US continued to drop, no doubt due to the raised tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s shipments to other major markets, such as the European Union, Japan and Southeast Asia, all rose strongly.  Meanwhile, despite assertions otherwise, the US economy has not remained unscathed, as shown by the need to offer emergency assistance to its farmers and the voices of complaint from US companies urging the administration to change tack.  Cooperation based on fully respecting mutual interests is the best way for the two countries to renew their trade and economic relations with a deal that is in line with the interests of both countries. If that has been the shared understanding during this week’s talks, and it is carried forward in the negotiations in Washington next week, hopefully the two sides will be able to narrow the differences between them sufficiently so that the two leaders can pencil in a date for a meeting at which they can shake hands on a deal that sets the right course for future relations.

Why doesn't US ditch zero-sum mentality in African development?,12/29/2018,"                      When US National Security Adviser John Bolton was laying out the new US strategy for Africa, which he announced on Dec 13, his primary concern was not about helping African countries with their economic and social development, but rather about countering China and Russia to advance the United States' selfish geopolitical goals.  Such a zero-sum mentality of a US politician came as no surprise. Former US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, and incumbent Vice-President Mike Pence have all labeled China's investment in, and trade with, Africa as ""predatory"" or ""debt trap"", or as tools of ""neocolonialism"".  Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, has endorsed Bolton's remarks. In a National Review article, titled ""The Coming Scramble in Africa"", Herman argues that China and Russia are ahead of the game to a degree, but the US has the advantage going forward. Like Bolton, Herman is neither a China expert nor an Africa expert, and therefore sees everything China does as bad and a threat to the US.  However skilled these people may be in waging a smear campaign against China, facts speak louder than words. Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is a leading authority in the field. And she gives China credit while pointing out its problems, unlike some pundits who only have a one-sided view: Everything China does is bad, and when bad things happen, it must be China's fault.  Brautigam recently told The East African, a Kenyan newspaper, that successive US policymakers ""have been spreading myths and rumors about what the Chinese are doing"" in Africa, as during her four-year in-depth study on China, she found ""no evidence at all"" to support the US government's depiction of China as a stealthy ""villain"" intent on ""sucking"" Africa's blood.  Contrary to the US charge, she argued that China does not typically give loans at high interest rates to African countries that it knows have little chance of repaying their debt. Rather, China varies its lending rates in accordance with its assessment of the African countries' repayment capabilities.  She noted that the US and other Western governments have also invested and lent to African governments with egregious record of repression and corruption. Warning against the Cold War mentality of US politicians, Brautigam said the Trump administration lacks the means to implement the ""Prosper Africa"" plan which Bolton boasted.  Compared with the US, which has long treated Africa as a continent that needs handouts, China, thanks to its experience of four decades of reform and opening-up, sees a promising future for Africa in helping lift people out of poverty and supporting it to achieve rapid economic and social development.  That's why China surpassed the US in trade with Africa in 2009. In fact, China's trade with Africa shot up to $170 billion in 2017, three times the US trade volume. Chinese companies have been building infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and power grids because Beijing knows infrastructure is essential to maintain as well as accelerate economic growth.  Bolton and some US pundits and media outlets have also alleged the People's Liberation Army logistics support base in Djibouti poses a threat to the nearby US military base. This claim is an example of sheer paranoia and beyond logic given the US' military might and its 800-plus military bases across the world.  At a seminar in Madrid last month, Chinese and European experts and former officials pointed to the huge potential China and European countries would have if they joined hands in third markets such as Africa and Latin America.  That's the sort of healthy and win-win mentality people like Bolton badly need to cultivate.  The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.          "
Phone call could be beginning of change in Sino-US ties,11/5/2018,"                      [Photo/VCG]   The phone talk between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on Thursday was probably the most positive signal in the past months in China-US relations haunted by tit-for-tat tariff retaliations and concerns over a new Cold War.  That they agreed to hold a meeting at the end of this month in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit is another positive signal. And the teams from the two sides will be working hard in the coming weeks to pave the way for a successful meeting.  Despite Trump's China bashing rhetoric during his presidential campaign, the bilateral relationship started unexpectedly well during the first year of the Trump administration when the two leaders met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April last year and again during Trump's state visit to Beijing last November.  But that amicable relationship took a steep downturn when the US singled out China as a revisionist power in its National Security Strategy last December and followed it up by a series of unilateral and hawkish moves against China, including punitive tariffs on imports from China, restrictions on Chinese investment in the US and hostile speeches on China such as the one made by Vice-President Mike Pence at the Hudson Institute on Oct 4.  Fear-mongering about China, including the Chinese news media operating in the US, the 300,000-plus Chinese students studying in US universities and colleges and various academic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, has resurged drastically.  The United States has also flirted with China's core national interests. The US Congress passed the provocative Taiwan Travel Act signed by Trump on March 16 this year. The US also threatened Latin American and African countries which sever ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan to establish formal relations with Beijing.  The dramatic turnabout in Sino-US relations on multiple fronts has triggered deep concern over whether the world's existing power and the rising power are heading into a new Cold War or Thucydides Trap, as Harvard University scholar Graham Allison has warned.  It is no secret that China and the US have major differences. And many of those differences will probably remain for a long time to come. No one, however, should deny that the two countries had far more differences and disagreements back in 1972 when US President Richard Nixon made the historic trip to China and in 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties. Yet the leaders of the two countries showed their wisdom by pursuing a path of expanding cooperation and managing and narrowing differences.  There is no doubt that the more than four decades of active engagement and cooperation have brought huge benefits for the two nations and their peoples, and made the world a safer place, if we recall the extreme hostile relations back in the 1960s and especially the early 1950s when the two countries fought in the bloody Korean War.  As philosopher George Santayana said, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The history of China-US relations serves as a warning for those who advocate a decoupling of the two economies, trigger an arms race and other confrontational approaches.  Tackling the thorny issues between China and the US won't be easy. That is exactly why the two countries should work even harder on those issues through dialogues instead of confrontation. There is no better alternative.  China and the US shoulder a great responsibility in tackling critical global issues, such as epidemic disease, climate change, peacekeeping and global governance.  Let's hope that the upcoming meeting between Xi and Trump will help reverse the course of the past months.  The author is a columnist at China Daily. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
The magic is in handwriting,2/26/2019,"                          The writing robot created by Xie Xun. Provided to China Daily   I absolutely detest tiger moms, mothers raising children in a traditional Chinese way, including extreme discipline, ultra-strict rules and tough love, as popularized in 2011 by Yale Law Professor Amy Chua in her book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. So I was incensed when I read the story in China Daily about a Harbin mother who smashed her teenage daughter’s robot-writer computer accessory to smithereens that she bought with her own red envelope-generated savings that so faithfully mimicked her own Chinese handwriting that she could do her calligraphy homework in record time in her own unique style so that no one could tell the difference.  I strongly agreed with the overwhelming online consensus that supported the student and I initially intended to argue that such a device was a welcome addition because cognitively it was no big deal and because it would be a real time saver for children, allowing them to have a few more moments to enjoy and savor their younger years. I really feel for Chinese children who seemingly have to compete with their peers from their first breath and who are loaded up with too much homework and out-of-school extracurricular activities.  Was I wrong! I went online to find scientific research to buttress my arguments and was shocked that this girl’s mother, who was quoted as telling her: “It can help you with homework, but can it help you on tests?”, was 100% correct. Handwriting characters, unlike typing them or using the robot, fires a host of brain cells having to do with memory and understanding. In fact, in the West, experts now recommend studying Chinese characters if merely to improve their learning abilities and knowledge retention, putting aside the numerous benefits of knowing the language coinciding with China’s rise.  Most of the scientific research I reviewed is based on the American English 26 letter alphabet linearly written from left to right, so imagine the multiplier effect of having to learn a minimum of 3,000 simplified Chinese characters to be considered literate, each one requiring up to 42 separate strokes written right, left, up and down. How do you learn them? It’s like the old New York joke where a tourist asks how to get to Carnegie Hall and the answer is “practice, practice, practice”.  This learning doesn’t come from typing them via the robot. Rather sequential finger and hand movements to create a letter or character literally, pun intended, fire off a brain storm of activity in the cognitive and spatial memories of the student.  Studies in the scientific field of haptics, which includes interactions of touch, hand movements and brain function, have shown that typing on a keyboard, as opposed to handwriting, creates significantly more information but that learning is much more shallow and the information is not as well retained. Areas of the brain associated with memory formation don’t fire when typing. This may be because typing is more mechanical, whereas writing is more mindful, requiring on-the-fly summarizing, organizing and concentration.  When children drew a letter of the alphabet, requiring a number of different skills, they showed increased activity in three areas of the brain that are activated in grown-ups when reading and writing: the left fusiform gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior parietal cortex. By contrast, children who typed the same letter with the touch of a key on a keyboard showed no such effect. The activation was significantly weaker.  Similarly, handwriting also promotes creativity. Writers like J.K Rowling, Ernest Hemingway and even Franz Kafka, who all had access to typewriters or computers, chose to create their masterpieces the old fashioned way with pen or pencil because handwriting enhanced their flights of fancy.  And handwriting is not only for the young but also for the young of heart. The more one uses the brain and creates neural pathways, the more healthy and robust aging brains are likely to be to maintain strong cognitive abilities. Lifelong learning is not only an enhancer of income and pleasure, but helps promote a high mental quality of life for seniors.  And in this brave new high tech 21st century world, where do we go from here? Compared to what’s coming, robot-writers are quite primitive. Voice to text software is improving day by day. When perfected, the temptation to lazily speak words in the name of increased efficiency and time saving may be overwhelming. In that case the benefits of handwriting, or even typing, will be further lost, along with the pleasure that it brings.  I wish that the robot-writer could have been the answer to freeing up time for children to enjoy their childhood. Alas, this no pain, no gain invention is no substitute for ad nauseam handwriting practice, practice, practice.  So even though I hate tiger moms, at least when it comes to the Harbin middle school student’s mother, she was right about writing. I am ashamed to admit that in this instance this Harvard Law School graduate has to reluctantly defer to a Yale Law School professor.

Optimistic about Kim-Trump summit,2/26/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump meets with DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un on Sentosa Island, Singapore on June 12, 2018. [Photo/IC]   With the second summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump slated for February 27-28, there is hope the two sides will make further headway. But it will not yield a positive outcome if Washington pushes for “permanent, irreversible, verifiable” denuclearization and Pyongyang insists on lifting sanctions.  Since the first meeting, held in June in Singapore, the vaguely worded agreement signed between the two sides for denuclearization was proved abortive despite the statement made in the UN Security Council by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “Chairman Kim committed to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”. Kim fears “Vietnam model” denuclearization seeking a step-by-step quid pro quo.  With this in mind, a trust deficit still lingers between Pyongyang and Washington. On the one hand, the US side seems skeptical of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s seriousness about denuclearization and, on the other hand, Kim doubts the bona fide intention of Trump’s administration for pursuing a tit-for-tat deal. Building mutual trust is believed to be a prerequisite for reaching a fruitful consensus.  It is evident that seeking a package agreement and once-for-all denuclearization in one meeting or two is neither reasonable nor possible. It is unlikely to include all the prerequisites and conditions of denuclearization and Pyongyang’s demands, such as withdrawal of US troops from the Republic of Korea, the lifting of sanctions and guaranteeing the security of the DPRK, in a single package. Thus, a “phased” and “synchronous” approach will be promising.  For instance, the Trump administration seems unwilling to include a quick withdrawal of US troops from ROK in the talks but expects Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal “very quickly”, as he told reporters immediately after the Singapore summit.  In the upcoming summit, the negotiating sides have to chart a clear roadmap to delineate the process of denuclearization and lifting of sanctions as well as the demands and responsibilities of each side.  Regional stakeholders expect a more positive outcome of the summit and want both sides to reach an effective consensus. “For example, for DPRK to agree to international monitors checking and reporting on its nuclear weapons and facilities; and for the US to agree partially lift sanctions,” Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of Korean studies at Renmin University, is cited as saying. He reiterated Beijing’s support for the summit, which is a key step towards regional stability.  Overall, the Hanoi Summit will be productive for two reasons. First, from harsh rhetoric and Trump’s “fire and furry”, the two sides sit face-to-face to resolve the insurmountable issue through negotiations. Such reconciliatory approach will put an end to the cold war and mitigate regional stability.  Second, the two sides are hoped to reach an agreement on denuclearization process, lifting sanctions on DPRK, formal ending to the 1950-53 Korean War, giving security guarantees to the DPRK, and establishing new relations between the US and DPRK. Although it is unlikely to have all these issues in a single package in one meeting or two, this summit will be one more step forward to decreasing the cold war mentality as well as regional instability.  Some political pundits call the Hanoi meeting “make-or-break summit” as they doubt its fruition. However, I believe that the summit will bring US and DPRK closer and create more room for optimism and better relations between the two sides. I emphasize that all the issues will not be finalized in this summit and US President and DPRK’s Chairman have to schedule a next summit for finalization.  Meanwhile, if the issues are too controversial, which may hamper them from reaching a consensus, the two sides have to consider engaging regional stakeholders in the talks. For example, China and Russia played essential role in brokering talks between Seoul and Pyeongyang and can continue their role, if they are demanded, to put their weight behind the talks.  An inclusive negotiation with the participation of regional stakeholders will lead to a more sustainable and trustworthy agreement. Moreover, the international community has to push for an inclusive consensus between the US and ROK on the one side and DPRK on the other side and make sure the agreement is practiced by all sides.

Washington's Huawei anxiety has become hysteria: China Daily editorial,2/14/2019,"                          Company logo at the office of Huawei in Beijing, Dec 6, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies has been in hot water lately.  And the water keeps getting hotter as Washington continues to fan the flames of hysteria over it being a security threat. Hard on the heels of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Monday warned allies that embracing Huawei technologies may jeopardize their partnerships with Washington, US Vice-President Mike Pence praised Poland on Wednesday, for ""protecting the telecoms sector from China"".  No telecoms operators in any country using Huawei equipment have reported security breaches. Even the White House, which has been fanatically trying to brand Huawei as a ""China threat"", has produced no evidence of the company's alleged involvement in spying.  While there is no hard truth to underpin it, the ongoing witch-hunt, which Washington is enthusiastically directing and tirelessly broadening, certainly means nothing. It betrays growing anxiety over, helplessness about, and inability to adapt to the new reality that the present-day world is increasingly turning from unipolar to multipolar.  Despite Beijing's persistent pledge that it wants to forge a constructive relationship with Washington, the latter has remained at best lukewarm, preferring instead to cling to its idée fixe that security will be out of the question if it is not the world's sole superpower.  So an anxious White House chooses to confront China ""on every front"". And it is matching that rhetoric with forceful actions.  Despite all the suspicion and suppression, the besieged Huawei has continually highlighted its willingness to accept security scrutiny. Which it believes is the only way to prove its innocence. But innocence hardly matters to the Washington fearmongers. They have become hysteria.  In the latest symptom of their distress, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, contending for a contract from the Washington, D.C. Metro, is labeled a potential source of ""cyber security risks"". Four Democratic senators have reportedly expressed concern that video surveillance cameras and the automated aspects of railway cars may be the tools of spies or hackers.  Following that logic, literally everything electronic produced by China can be turned into surveillance devices and be exploited by the Chinese government — lighting, signs, TVs, microwaves, fridges, even toys.  At the end of the day, they imply, can you lie on a made-in-China mattress without worrying you are being eavesdropped by some ears across the Pacific?  James Groft, chief executive of James Valley Telecommunications, who told The Wall Street Journal he hasn't seen Huawei do anything wrong, said he needs ""something credible, and not fearmongering"". Because he knows the hysteria will only end up hurting his US clients.  But that is unlikely to be forthcoming. In an article for the Financial Times, Robert Hannigan, the former head of UK's GCHQ intelligence arm, said its National Cyber Security Centre, has been evaluating Huawei's presence in UK telecom networks for some years, and it has never found any evidence of malicious Chinese state cyber activity through the company.

Talks can produce fresh progress toward a deal: China Daily editorial,2/14/2019,"                          New round of China-US trade talks starts in Beijing on Feb 14, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   Amid a good fall of snow, which Chinese traditionally believe promises a year of harvest and prosperity, Chinese and United States top officials started two days of talks in Beijing on Thursday.  It is encouraging that after the deputy-level meetings on Monday and Tuesday to work out the technical details for an agreement — including a mechanism for enforcing any deal — the face-to-face discussions being conducted between decision-makers from both countries are being held amid a general air of optimism.  The negotiations are being led by Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose cordial discussions in Washington on Jan 30 and 31 raised hopes that the two sides are genuinely doing their utmost to reach an agreement ahead of the March 1 deadline when US tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent.  But there are still obstacles to be overcome, and no one should underestimate how daunting a task the two sides face trying to resolve all the differences that have long existed between them in one clean sweep.  Which is why US President Donald Trump’s latest remarks — that the negotiations have been progressing “very well” and he might reportedly even let the March 1 deadline “slide for a little while” — have been taken as portents that progress is being made and a positive result may well be on the way.  Especially as White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has raised the possibility of Trump meeting with President Xi Jinping at the US president's personal retreat at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, sometime in March — The White House has previously said the two leaders would have to meet to strike the final bargain.  The market never lies, as the saying goes. Let’s hope that’s true, because the stock market has already cast a vote of confidence in China and the US being able to reach a deal. The bench mark Shanghai Composite Index has rebounded more than 10 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average, more than 15 percent, from their lows in December when Sino-US trade tensions were running high.  It is apt that melting snow symbolizes a new beginning, as positive progress in the talks would mean a convergence of expectations for bilateral relations and help ensure the Sino-US relationship has a solid foundation of mutual trust and good momentum for positive interaction at the start of its fifth decade.

Warsaw conference an exercise in futility: China Daily editorial,2/13/2019,"                             Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz (right) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hold a news conference at Lazienki Palace in Warsaw, Poland Feb 12, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   The two-day Middle East conference that started in Poland's capital Warsaw on Wednesday proclaims it will help promote peace and stability in the region. But it is sailing against the wind if it wants to yield any substantial result. There will likely be ""all thunder and no rain"" — as the Chinese saying goes — given the deep divisions between the United States and its European allies on such key issues as the Iran nuclear deal, as well as the diverse agendas being pursued by the participating countries.  The foreign ministers and senior officials from 60 countries are attending the conference. But the absence of Federica Mogherini, high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, and the foreign ministers of key European powers such as Germany and France suggests Europe is not going to fall in line behind the US on the Middle East, especially after Washington last year unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — the EU still wants to save the deal — and its decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which Europe considers too hasty.  And the fact that Iran was not even invited, and its ally Russia declined to attend, suggests the meeting will be more like a trial by default against Iran — Washington has already accused Teheran of destabilizing the region and supporting terrorism, and vowed to change its ""behavior"" — rather than a platform for relevant parties to come together and find a solution to the problem they face through consultations and negotiations.  Teheran has already dubbed the conference an ""anti-Iran circus"" and has firmly protested at Poland hosting the event.  But even though Poland is lobbying the US for a permanent US base on its territory as part of its efforts to strengthen the Polish-US alliance against Russia, and thus wants to keep in Washington's good books, it has sought to emphasize that Iran is not the sole focus of the conference.  And though the US may want the focus to be on Iran, other participants also appear to have different priorities. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, for instance, said he primarily wants to use the event to address the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.  The attendees will also be keen to hear the US plans for promoting peace between Palestinians and Israelis, which is also on the agenda, although the controversial decision by the White House to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem last year has basically made it impossible for the US to continue playing its role as a peace intermediary.  The Palestinian government — which has called the Warsaw meeting an ""American conspiracy"" — has refused talks with the US until it implements a more balanced policy.  The quest for peace in the Middle East shall never cease, but unfortunately the Warsaw meeting despite its claim to be in pursuit of that purpose is unlikely to serve that end.         "
Mentality of US poses biggest threat to humanity from space: China Daily editorial,2/13/2019,"                             The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, scheduled to launch a US Air Force navigation satellite, sits on Launch Complex 40 after the launch was postponed after an abort procedure was triggered by the onboard flight computer, at Cape Canaveral, Florida, US, Dec 18, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   Forget asteroids, it is the United States and its pathological need to maintain its hegemony at any cost that pose the biggest threat to humanity from space.  In its latest Defense Intelligence Agency report, the US claims that Russia and China have taken steps to challenge the US in space technology, blatantly ignoring the fact that space does not belong to it, and every country has the right to peacefully explore it.  The report says that ""long-standing technological and cost barriers to space are falling, enabling more countries and commercial firms to participate in satellite construction, space launch, space exploration and human spaceflight"".  But from the way it talks about what China and Russia or other countries have achieved in their development of space technology, it seems as if the US believes that when it planted a flag on the moon it staked the claim to have the sole use of space.  Such a hegemonic mentality actually poses a threat to the world's peaceful exploration of space and the peaceful exploitation of it for the benefit of all people on Earth.  It is with this mentality that the report catalogs and details supposed threats Russia and China may pose to the US in space.  For the US, there is no justice and fairness when it comes to its relations with other countries, especially when it assumes that its dominance in a particular area is being challenged.  Those who have written the report have listed threats that are anything but real. The US assumptions about the threats only serve to justify what it wants to do. In other words, the US is only making a case for maintaining its dominance in space technology.  The ""Space Force"" the US administration has proposed, which will see huge amounts of resources devoted to pushing the US military capabilities in space, is what it really intends to achieve by positing that other countries with space technology pose a threat to its national security.  Despite China's reiteration about it being committed to peaceful exploration of space and its openness to cooperation with any country in its development of space technology, the US will not give up its desire to have dominance in this domain, and it is devoting a great deal of effort to presenting China and Russia as threats to serve this purpose.  Its huge investment in the development of a ""Space Force"" will, as a result, inevitably give rise to an arms race off the Earth, which will shatter the human dream of the peaceful exploration of space.

Biased judgments sabotage fight against terrorism: China Daily editorial,2/12/2019,"                          Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN [File photo/IC]   With international efforts to combat the Islamic State terrorist group achieving decisive success in Syria and Iraq, the world has a hard-won opportunity to push forward the fight against terrorism and extremism. But that requires countries work together and show zero-tolerance to terrorists and their extremist ideologies.  Which was the call for action that Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, made on Monday. His words should not fall on deaf ears. Instead, they should rally greater international consensus that concerted efforts are needed to eliminate terrorism and make members of the international community fully recognize the threat of all terrorist forces, including the so-called East Turkestan Islamic Movement.  In recent years, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement has plotted and carried out a number of terrorist attacks in China, most frequently in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.  The terrorist group has also posed a serious threat to countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, and some of its members have illegally crossed the border into Southeast Asian countries en route to join up with other terrorist groups in these regions.  Despite this, some Western countries have deliberately tried to play down the threat posed by East Turkestan terrorist forces. Worse, some Western media have even equated the atrocities committed by East Turkestan terrorist elements in China to separatist violence.  Such a double standard only discourages and hinders international efforts to combat terrorism in all forms.  Drawing on the anti-terrorism experience of the international community and based on its own realities, the Chinese government has been actively working to counter terrorism and extremism and made notable achievements.  But it is fully aware that terrorism is a common enemy of mankind, and no country can cope with it alone. Thus it has actively promoted international cooperation to fight terrorism, not least through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and its 2019-21 program of cooperation for combating the three evil forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism.  The war on terror is at a critical juncture. The world community should embrace the concept of a community of shared future for mankind and forge greater unity of purpose. Those who harbor no prejudice or malicious intentions should be willing to oppose any double standard and genuinely seek greater solidarity.         "
Pompeo puts US paranoia front and center in Europe: China Daily editorial,2/12/2019,"                      A file photo of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [Photo/IC]   United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on a five-nation trip to Europe, of which the highlight is supposed to be the conference on the future of the Middle East, with a heavy emphasis on containing Iran.  But that seems to have in no way diminished Washington's obsession with Huawei, and of course China.  On the very first leg of the trip, in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, the top US diplomat once again issued an unsubstantiated allegation that the Chinese telecommunications company was a security risk, warning its NATO ally that its embrace of Huawei technologies presented ""actual risks"" to the Hungarian people and that it risked China using the technology ""in a way that is not in the best interest of Hungary"". Blahdiblah, you probably know how it goes by now.  Of course, he made it sound reasonable: ""They are a sovereign nation"", he said. ""They get to make their own decisions"".  But not really, since there is a choice to be made: Huawei or the US.  Getting to the heart of the matter, he said if countries choose Huawei, it ""makes it difficult for America to be present … and makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them"". Which showed the US is not above some arm-twisting to get what it wants, and making it clear the US administration is motivated by more than simple technological, or business competition.  Considering the Chinese tech giant has come into the White House's crosshairs, the latter's determination to coalesce an international siege against the company comes as no surprise, especially if it wants to sustain US commercial edge in the next-generation telecommunications market. But Pompeo made no secret about Washington's geopolitical anxiety. He confessed the US has its eyes on reversing what he called a decade of US disengagement in Central Europe that left a vacuum for Russia and China to exploit. He even warned his hosts of ""the dangers of allowing China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary"".  The message cannot be clearer: the US is not only returning to continental Europe, it wants exclusive presence. Washington is worried about Russian and Chinese influence that it fears has grown in its own absence. Huawei is only an excuse.  But Hungarian Foreign and Trade Minister Peter Szijjarto made a sensible point during a joint news conference with Pompeo: ""When it comes to cooperation with Russia or cooperation with the People's Republic of China that does not harm us being reliable as a NATO ally"".  Indeed, why must a Budapest-Washington relationship be an exclusive one when Hungary relies on Russia for 85 percent of its energy needs and maintains close, extensive economic cooperation with China?  No doubt, Pompeo will be hawking the same message to every other stop on his European trip. But the idea of exclusive relations may not sell everywhere. Because Budapest will certainly not be the only one to have smelled the ""enormous hypocrisy"" in such an approach.         "
Bad mistake by Ankara not to fact-check claims: China Daily editorial,2/11/2019,"                          Women dressed in colorful outfits perform at the 27th Silk Road Turpan Grape Festival in Turpan, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Sept 3, 2018. [Photo provided to Chinadaily.com.cn]   Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy seemed to be telling tales from the Arabian Nights when he accused China of ""serious human rights violations"" in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. In a statement on Saturday, he particularly tried to demonize China's counter-terrorism efforts in the region, calling the education facilities the government has set up there ""internment camps and prisons"" that are used for the purpose of ""systematic assimilation"".  It is a pity that Ankara has resorted to presenting misinformation, misconceptions, and even complete lies, in making such groundless and irresponsible allegations. The Turkish spokesman revealed how spurious the allegations were, when he mentioned in his statement the ""tragic"" death of Uygur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who, in fact, is still alive and in good health in prison, where he is serving an eight year sentence for jeopardizing national security.  Since the 1990s, terrorists, separatists and extremists in Xinjiang and abroad have plotted and conducted thousands of terrorist attacks in the region and the rest of the country, killing a large number of innocent people and hundreds of police officers. The establishment of education facilities including vocational training centers in Xinjiang is part of the central government's comprehensive efforts to fight the three evil forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, which are common enemies of humanity.  Such facilities help people resist and purge extremist indoctrination through lessons that give them proficiency in Mandarin, knowledge of the law and vocational skills so that they can acquire some professional skills and get rid of religious fanaticism and extremist ideology before returning to society.  Since their establishment more than two years ago, there have been no terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and tourist arrivals increased by 50 percent in 2018, suggesting the region is becoming more stable and safer.  Meanwhile, people of various ethnic groups now enjoy unprecedented religious freedom in Xinjiang, where for an average of 530 Muslims there is one mosque, as compared with one for 910 Muslims in Turkey.  Choosing to turn a blind eye to the facts, Turkey has attacked China over its anti-terrorism efforts, including the education facilities in Xinjiang. One cannot but raise an eyebrow over why Ankara has so readily subjected itself to bias and anti-China chorus before even conducting basic facts-checking, as such facilities are open to the world and have received visits from ambassadors to China and foreign correspondents, including the Turkish ones.  In doing so, it has undoubtedly harmed mutual trust and done a disservice to the two countries' counter-terrorism and counter-separatism cooperation. Ankara should seek to repair the damage it has done to bilateral ties and the efforts to counter terrorism and extremism.         "
Wily Washington ropes EU into its ruses: China Daily editorial,2/11/2019,"                          European Union flags are seen outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Nov 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   To those who live on a steady diet of Hollywood bubble gum and who are gullible enough to believe everything they read or hear about evil regimes intent on taking over the world, it must seem like Brussels is the new Berlin — a hotbed of intrigue and espionage.  At least that is what the European External Action Service would have them believe, according to a report in Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper.  Despite the fact that it apparently already has the capacity to listen in to everything that is said through backdoors supposedly installed in cellphones, computers, washing machines or anything else that has been made in China, it seems China still needs to give lodging to around 250 spies in its embassy and give them expenses so that they can surreptitiously dine in the same restaurants as European diplomats and military officials in the hope these powerful personages will inadvertently let slip some juicy nugget of information after a glass too many of Chablis.  The claims of the EEAS, and those made by the Lithuanian intelligence and security services against the Chinese telecommunications leader Huawei, also last week, are the latest in a chorus of allegations against China and the Chinese company being orchestrated by the United States.  This time the latest groundless accusations came after US officials toured EU capitals urging European governments not to use Huawei technology and equipment for next generation telecommunications infrastructure, and at a time when the EEAS is trying to keep the US sweet on NATO after Washington questioned its worth to the US.  One only has to look at how counterintuitive it would be for China to sabotage its sound cooperation with its European partners — and the economic benefits it reaps from those good relations — given the increasing pressure the US is applying in their trade conflict to appreciate how ridiculous these accusations are.  Indeed it is the trade dispute and competition between the world's two largest economies that explains why such reports have emerged now — The US is seeking whatever leverage it can to exert pressure on China, using its European allies in this way is just a matter of habit.  Some politicians in both the US and EU countries may consider the scaremongering about China as ideologically necessary since China's rise as a communist country is the last thing they want to see. However, in doing so they have to turn a blind eye to the fact that China wants and needs a peaceful environment for its economic development and social progress.  European politicians should realize that it will do their countries no good to unquestioningly follow Washington's lead. Doing so only plays into the hands of the US, which would be happy to get what it wants from a divided EU and the disintegration of the EU-China partnership.         "
Right attitude to talks has been fruitful so far: China Daily editorial,2/10/2019,"                      China and the United States will hold a new round of high-level talks this week in their latest attempt to bridge their differences on economic and trade policies. Preparatory lower-level talks begin on Monday before the principal talks led by Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday. That the respective delegations have progressively grown in size and the discussions have continued during the Christmas and Spring Festival holidays shows not only are both sides committed to finding a way to end their dispute, but also that concrete progress is being made toward achieving that goal. In previous talks, China has shown its utmost sincerity by taking a practical problem-solving approach. For instance, by increasing imports of agricultural products from the US and accelerating the opening up of its financial sector. It has also agreed to take concrete measures to strengthen protection of intellectual property rights, a major concern of the US side. The US, on its part, has gradually become less highhanded and more cooperative and the discussions have evolved to become more far-reaching and in-depth. But to ensure the world's two largest economies can ultimately reach a farsighted agreement that sets a solid foundation for the future of their relations, their upcoming discussions must continue to seek long-term remedies not quick-fix tonics. As the two sides have listened to each other's concerns they have come to understand each other better. And since the leaders of the two countries met in Argentina in December and agreed on a 90-day process of talks to prevent an escalation of the dispute, tangible progress has been made in bridging their differences. If the US side does not try to force China to implement untimely structural reforms there is no reason why further progress cannot be made if the two sides continue to talk in accordance with the principles of mutual respect and reciprocity, and with a willingness to work together for shared benefits. Bearing this in mind, US President Donald Trump's remark on Thursday he did not expect to meet President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline for the two economic superpowers to reach a deal, does not foretell an agreement is not forthcoming or that the impending tariffs will be triggered. Clearly there are still differences — perhaps sizable — to be overcome, but Trump's comment that a final resolution of the trade dispute would depend on the meeting with Xi ""in the near future"" suggests that they are not insurmountable hurdles. Hopefully, this week's talks will get the two sides past a few more potential stumbling blocks and continue the good momentum that has been achieved since the two leaders set the process in motion.

Here's hoping Trump-Kim summit can deliver the goods: China Daily editorial,2/10/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and DPRK's leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It has been confirmed a second summit between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un will take place on Feb 27-28 in Hanoi, Vietnam.  Congratulations to both parties for taking another step toward ending one of the world's most dangerous standoffs and the ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  If the pending summit does end up sustaining the reportedly productive momentum of the preparatory negotiations, it will be remembered for laying solid groundwork for the critical next steps needed for the denuclearization process.  There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense. Which is no doubt why the two parties seem to be diligently working together to present something truly deliverable.  Trump, though he tends to on most things, sounds very optimistic about the upcoming meeting. ""North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse … a different kind of Rocket — an Economic one!"" he tweeted. The change-of-tone twist on an earlier tongue-in-cheek remark suggesting the two sides are at least talking cordially and respectfully to one another.  But while the DPRK economy may indeed take off, it is unlikely to do so without a complete thaw in US-DPRK relations. Only then will Pyongyang be able to concentrate on developing the national economy, without having to worry about external security threats. And such a thaw is unlikely to materialize unless the current state of war is formally put to an end and the shadow of nuclear threats are removed. On these will hinge what Trump and Kim can deliver in Hanoi.  Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for the DPRK, made an important point the other day on his return from ""productive"" preparatory talks in Pyongyang, ""We have some hard work to do with the DPRK between now and then."" Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.  And if the ""set of concrete deliverables"" for the second summit he reportedly discussed with DPRK officials did include Trump's readiness to officially conclude the Korean War, then perhaps we should join Trump in being optimistic about the summit, since that would show the White House is indeed committed to transforming US-DPRK ties and building lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.  So let's extend our best wishes that the preparatory negotiations are both smooth and productive, and the Hanoi summit proves a success. For peace and stability in the region some concrete outcomes would certainly be most welcome.         "
"Positive message of practical, concrete progress in trade talks: China Daily editorial",2/1/2019,"                      US President Donald Trump hailed the two-day talks between China and the United States as having made ""tremendous progress"" in the two sides' efforts to find a solution to their trade dispute.  The progress is tremendous not only because the two sides have candidly discussed a series of divisive issues, such as trade, technology transfer, intellectual property protection and agriculture, and reached some agreement, but because, more important, they have demonstrated that specific discussions to find ways to address their differences with some mutual give-and-take can be ""fruitful"", as the Chinese delegation described the talks.  Since the US initiated the ongoing dispute with China last year, it has imposed high tariffs on Chinese products — prompting tit-for-tat actions — and then repeatedly threatened harsher punishments. But such an unreasonable attitude and lack of respect for China's interests has harmed the US economy as well as China's, and threatened to inflict serious damage on the global supply chains that would take a long time to fix.  The positive message being sent by both sides after their current talks suggests the two sides have realized that the most productive way to seek progress in promoting their respective interests is through candid consultations rather than confrontation.  At his news conference on Thursday, after meeting with Vice-Premier Liu He, who headed the Chinese delegation, Trump said that a letter from President Xi Jinping — in which the Chinese president wrote that he hoped the two sides would continue to act in a spirit of mutual respect in order to reach an early agreement that works for the interests of both sides — had set the right tone for the talks and put them on a good footing.  It was always wishful thinking to expect two days of talks to deliver a deal, but clearly the negotiations have been going on for a while and will continue after a short break for Chinese Lunar New Year, so the undoubtedly upbeat message that a deal could be in the offing if all goes well seems to be based on a clear understanding of what needs to be done to get it across the line.  That the talks have produced a welcome consensus toward striking a comprehensive deal was confirmed by Liu, who said that it would ultimately be agreed when Xi and Trump meet.  That both sides have said that a deal will ultimately have to be hammered home by the two leaders — in one or two meetings according to Trump — suggests there are still some sticking points to be overcome.  But Trump was characteristically bullish, saying that ""when President Xi and myself meet, every point will be agreed to"".  But even the more cautious words of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said it was impossible to predict success, gave grounds for optimism, as he said ""we are in a place that, if things work, it could happen"".  The situation is complex, not least because China is in a critical stage in transforming its development mode. But the country is determined to deepen its reform and opening-up, and some of the US demands for structural reforms are in line with the direction the Chinese leaders have mapped out. The question now is, can a mutually agreeable timeframe for those be agreed before the March 1 deadline suspending further tariffs on Chinese goods expires?  Having come this far toward meeting each other half-way, it would undo all the good work that has been done to build trust and make practical progress not to go the extra mile to clear the final hurdles.

Nobel Peace Prize should  not be used as political tool: China Daily editorial,1/31/2019,"                          A screen grab from CCTV 13 shows lham Tohti at the court in 2014.   In a move that interferes in China's internal affairs, US lawmakers from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China nominated Ilham Tohti, a jailed Uyghur teacher, for the Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday.  Tohti, a former teacher at Beijing's Minzu University of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014 for promoting separatism. But in the letter of nomination sent to the president of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, and its other members, he was eulogized as a scholar that ""embodies the peaceful struggle for peace and human rights in China"", and thus there is ""no one more deserving of the committee's recognition in 2019"" than him.  By nominating someone who has committed serious crimes by undermining peace and stability in China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the US lawmakers are trying to humiliate China.  In fact, the nomination itself runs counter to the spirit of the prize which aims to promote peace worldwide. The committee already faces a lot of criticism for handing out its laurels to some controversial figures in recent years.  This is not the first time that the Nobel Peace Prize has been used as a political tool by outside anti-China forces to meddle in the Xinjiang issue. Back in 2006, notorious Xinjiang separatist Rebiya Kadeer, the ""chairwoman"" of the so-called World Uygur Congress, was nominated for the same prize.  Of course, there is a big difference between nomination and actually winning the prize, but the latest move shows US lawmakers still want to send a message to the world to express their opposition to China's policy in Xinjiang. As before, their ulterior motives are doomed to fail.  The current peaceful and stable situation in Xinjiang is clear evidence that the central government's efforts to counter separatist ideology in the region are working and its policy has won widespread support from all Chinese people, including Uygurs in Xinjiang.  True, there is a stark contrast between the Chinese and Western judgments on the situation in Xinjiang. But the Xinjiang issue is complicated and sensitive as it not only involves the issue of sovereignty and human rights but also ethnicity and religion.  Hence, it is inappropriate for the US lawmakers to try and simplify the Xinjiang issue as discrimination on the part of China. Those in Washington need to take off their biased spectacles and view Xinjiang through a more objective and fair lens.         "
Actions against Huawei cold war of technology: China Daily editorial,1/31/2019,"                          Visitors are attracted by products at Huawei stand at the International Funkausstellung 2017, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, in Berlin, Sep 2, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   It was reported on Wednesday that the European Union is considering proposals that would effectively amount to a de facto ban on Huawei's equipment for next-generation mobile networks based on concerns that it might compromise national security. This is just the latest move in a concerted series of attacks on the Chinese telecom giant by the United States and its allies.  By making such allegations, if the European Commission were to amend the definition of critical infrastructure in EU law to include 5G mobile networks, it would effectively prohibit EU businesses from using Huawei equipment on the grounds it might be used for spying or sabotage.  The constant detraction of Huawei has been orchestrated by the US, as part of its pressure tactics to contain China. Having conjured the accusation that the Chinese company represents a national security threat out of thin air, it has roped in its allies as accomplices in its fear mongering. The attacks against Huawei are now unabating and unceasing. Indeed, on the part of the US, they have become increasingly nasty, as shown by the charges announced against the company and some of its representatives by the US Justice Department on Tuesday.  The slander, discrimination, pressure and coercion of the US and its allies are nothing more than a pretext to squeeze Huawei out of the global market. The US would consider it a victory in the technology cold war it is waging against China if it could eliminate Huawei. And it would be of particular significance to the EU, as the other leading 5G companies are Sweden's LM Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.  Yet Huawei supplies 45 of the top 50 global telecom companies and has signed contracts with 30 carriers to test its next-generation technology. Given how integrated the telecommunications industry is, blocking Huawei's development will also harm the development of other countries' telecom companies and the industry as a whole.  Huawei will do whatever it can to protect its rights and interests. It has already set up laboratories in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom for their governments to conduct security tests on its software and hardware.  But the actions of the US and its allies have nothing to do with national security or fair competition. Instead, they are the actions of a politically motivated lynch mob as the West seeks to obstruct China's development as a world power in science and technology.  The US has long used national security as an excuse to deny exports of key technologies to China. And whenever Chinese technology companies cut conspicuous figures overseas through their own efforts, the US is on pins and needles until it can find a way to suppress their development.  Beyond the immediate horizon of the US-instigated persecution of Huawei lies the future digital society. Countries should reflect on how that society can avoid the persistence of past prejudices.         "
Defense radar plan puts regional stability at risk: China Daily editorial,1/30/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and DPRK's leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   In another provocative move that may further complicate regional security and even spark a new arms race among major powers, the United States is reportedly mulling a plan to deploy a new stationary radar — the Homeland Defense Radar — in Japan to help reinforce the US system aimed at intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting US territories.   The US already boasts the world's most advanced land-based anti-ballistic missile system, with missiles deployed in Alaska and California to intercept attacks. Yet in the Missile Defense Review released on Jan 17, US President Donald Trump still expressed the intention to reinforce that system, citing threats of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks by Russia, China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The radar deployment is just part of that plan.  Building unrivaled and unmatched military supremacy for the US has been in Trump's mind ever since he came to office. His professed military buildup ambition includes a dramatic increase in US nuclear stockpiles and building a Space Force to turn space into a war-fighting domain like the land, air and sea. His threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty risks undoing all disarmament efforts the world has witnessed over the past decades.   But the claim these moves are in response to military threats to the US is absurd. No country poses any danger to the world's sole superpower, whose military spending is more than that of all other major countries combined.  But hyping up threats from real and imagined adversaries has been a pretext Washington likes to use to seek uncontested military domination in the world. In 2017 it used the threat of missile attacks from the DPRK to install its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system in the Republic of Korea, breaking the existing military balance in the region.   The situation on the Korean Peninsula has improved markedly since last year. A historic summit was held between Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, with both leaders expressing their commitment to denuclearization and ending decades of hostilities.  Since both countries are working for peace on the peninsula, the radar plan seems out of place, it will only do a disservice to the ongoing detente and trust building and may even derail efforts to make the region nuclear free.   History proves that seeking unilateral and absolute security at the cost of the security of other countries will only trigger an arms race, which in return will cause more instability and make the world a more dangerous rather than a safer place. Washington must abandon its Cold War mentality and stop its aggressive moves for the good of peace and stability in the region.         "
Taiwan 'nationhood' talk only leads it to abyss: China Daily editorial,1/30/2019,"                      Responding to the recent clamor in Taiwan for a new ""constitution"", Beijing warned on Wednesday that pursuing ""jurisprudential independence"" with a new ""constitution"" will only push Taiwan down a ""dangerous abyss"". The mainland will ""absolutely not sit on our hands looking"", said a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office. There is every sign that, instead of learning the real lesson from their Nov 24 defeat in the island's local elections, hardcore independence seekers in the Democratic Progressive Party are trying to blaze a more radical trail. But their adventure is destined to be fruitless and, as Beijing has admonished, hazardous. Suicidal, to be precise. Inaugurating his ""Taiwan New Constitution Foundation"" on Jan 23, long-term ""independence"" advocate Koo Kwang-ming said a new ""constitution"" would give Taiwan a sense of ""nationhood"". Koo, who is now 93, can hardly make a difference, good or bad, regarding the status of Taiwan. No matter how hard he tries. Equally obviously, though, the ambitious Lai Ching-te thinks he can. The former head of the ""executive yuan"", who stepped down on Jan 11 as a result of the DPP's Nov 24 failure, endorsed Koo's aspiration for a new ""constitution"". Present leader Tsai Ing-wen's obsession with the ""status quo"" of relations across the Taiwan Straits has limited Taiwan's participation in the international community, Lai said. To change that, the island needs a new ""constitution"". With that, Taiwan will be able to solve the issue of being an ""unrecognized nation"". In his words, Taiwan would have stayed within the United Nations had then leader Chiang Kai-shek not refused to participate alongside Beijing. Completely ignoring the historical truth that the UN members recognized Beijing as the sole, official representative of China. Accordingly, he attributed the DPP's latest defeat to Tsai's disloyalty to the party's fundamental goal of independence, and the party's failure to translate corresponding advocacy and opinions into ""the next step"". While Lai labels himself as a ""pragmatic worker"" for ""jurisprudential independence"", many believe in so doing he is just wooing support from the ""deep green"" faction for his potential bid for local leadership in the 2020 elections. Once he fills Tsai's shoes, observers say, he too, like all DPP predecessors, will hover around the ""status quo"". All such, uncertainties notwithstanding, one thing is for sure. Beijing will not tolerate any move toward ""jurisprudential independence"". The mainland's Anti-Secession Law has no ambiguity about that. Its Article 5 stipulates, ""upholding the principle of one China is the basis of peaceful reunification of the country"". The new ""constitution"" Koo and Lai advocate would inevitably eliminate that basis. What follows then, would indeed be an abyss of devastating potential.         "
Trade talks are not a contest to see who blinks first: China Daily editorial,1/29/2019,"                      It is being anticipated that the upcoming talks between China and the United States will produce some positive results, but whether those expectations are met will depend on both sides being genuine in their efforts to bridge their differences and reach an agreement.  The high profile makeup of the Chinese delegation that arrived in Washington on Monday for the economic and trade negotiations scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, shows that China is sincere in seeking a workable solution to the two countries' ongoing trade standoff.  Led by Vice-Premier Liu He, the delegation includes top officials from the central bank, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, as well as the Ministry of Commerce and other ministries.  However, sincerity from Beijing alone will not be enough.  That is why US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Monday that President Donald Trump is set to meet Liu during his visit has been interpreted as a good sign as it suggests the US is also participating in the talks in good faith.  But while it is evident to both sides that it is in their own interests, and to the benefit of the world economy as a whole, that they end their trade dispute, it remains to be seen if they can maneuver their way to such an outcome. Especially given the US Justice Department's actions against the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei and its chief financial officer, which were announced on Monday.  Given the timing, this has been widely perceived to be a ploy to push for the structural reforms the US wants, but the issues to be discussed are complicated enough, without any additional complications being added to the mix.  The two sides will need to ensure their discussions stay on track if a framework for progress is to be produced, without which it will be very hard to prevent the cease-fire ending without an agreement. The subsequent trade war would do grievous harm to the global economy, as well as the Chinese and US economies. As the global financial crisis that originated in the US showed, such damage would take a long time to fix.  Just the breadth and depth of their discussions is daunting to consider. Nevertheless, China's commitment and determination to deepen reform and opening-up have been demonstrated with new measures that provide a solid platform to build on, so long as the two sides can agree on a time frame for further measures, and reciprocal actions are forthcoming.  There will be around 30 days for further negotiations after the meetings in Washington before the March 2 deadline for the suspension of further US tariffs on Chinese goods expires. It is to be hoped that focuses attention on the need to be reasonable and sober-minded, because a full-scale trade war between the two economic powerhouses would certainly make for more uncertain times.

Mud slung at Huawei sticks to Washington: China Daily editorial,1/29/2019,"                          Visitors are attracted by products at Huawei stand at the International Funkausstellung 2017, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, in Berlin, Sep 2, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   At a news conference, acting US Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said that two affiliates of Huawei had been indicted on 10 federal crimes related to accusations that Huawei stole technology from T-Mobile, and that Huawei, its chief financial officer, an affiliate in Iran and one of its subsidiaries in the US had been indicted on 13 charges related to allegations that Huawei committed financial fraud by violating US sanctions against doing business with Iran.  That these charges are politically motivated should be evident from the extrajudicial nature of the sanctions-busting accusation — which reveals more about the ingrained US hostility toward Iran — and the fact the T-Mobile technology in question, robotic technology that tests the durability of smartphones, was proudly being displayed on YouTube before the Huawei employees allegedly stole it.  The fact that Apple, Facebook and Uber, among others, have been accused of stealing trade secrets, as well as a steady stream of cases where people leave a company with its know-how and sell that knowledge to competitors, shows how cut and thrust the technology competition is.  Yet over the years, even though the US has developed a penchant for accusing Chinese companies of stealing trade secrets and being a threat to national security, on no occasion has it provided any solid evidence.  Last October, Bloomberg claimed China was putting spy chips in the hardware of US companies. The companies cited denied that possibility. And no matter how strong one's allegiance to the Stars and Stripes may be, so far the only country that has been caught resorting to such nefarious practices is, you guessed it, the US.  Such unwarranted accusations reveal the truth often demonstrated, that the US, being in possession of a big fortune, believes other countries are beneath it. China is at the crucial stage of its transformation from being a large country to becoming a strong one, and this success, as embodied by companies such as Huawei, has invited detraction.  Washington should be told a lie will not become truth even if it is repeated 1,000 times, or more.  The latest US decision, together with its pending request to Canada for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, shows the US is determined to take a hard line on the Huawei case, but this will not deter either China or Huawei from pursuing the heights of the 21st century.

"Accusations against Huawei all smears, with no substance: China Daily editorial",1/28/2019,"                          Visitors are attracted by products at Huawei stand at the International Funkausstellung 2017, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, in Berlin, Sep 2, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   The West has long taken pride in claiming the moral high ground with regard to the rule of law, a just and transparent business environment and a level playing field for businesses, while at the same time accusing China of lacking them. But the way some Western countries are suppressing the development of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei gives the lie to these claims and shows them to be nothing more than a means to an end.  So much for the presumption of innocence — Huawei has been declared guilty without a trial and without any hope of appeal in the United States, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, all of which have banned the use of its equipment. And the European Union seems set to follow suit.  It doesn't take the deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes to see the United States is the common factor in this witch hunt, as the others are all its go-to allies. Their actions are a concerted effort to use national security as an excuse to destroy the legitimate business operations of the Chinese company which are in full swing.  Why? Because as Ren Zhengfei, CEO and founder of Huawei, said in a rare interview recently there are only a few manufacturers in the world that can make 5G products, and Huawei is the best of them, and it is currently the only manufacturer in the world that is capable of equipping 5G base stations with the state-of-the-art microwave technology.  So despite the fact Huawei has been operating in 170 countries worldwide, including in developed countries, without causing any concerns, and despite the fact it has signed 30 5G commercial contracts and delivered more than 25,000 5G base stations worldwide without being involved in any security incident, the US — perhaps concerned it will no longer be able to spy on everyone if it is not the one that has supplied the equipment, it being the only one known to do so — has been rounding up its allies to conduct a smear campaign against the Chinese company.  That its allies have readily joined the politically motivated game the US has orchestrated is extremely disappointing as it shows they have surrendered any autonomy of action. It is especially upsetting that the EU might decide to join them, as China has always considered the bloc to be a comprehensive strategic partner that it can work with to uphold rules-based multilateralism and oppose the might-is-right unilateralism of the US.  However, it is evident that the fear mongering of the US has been paying off, and its allies are willing to follow its lead in violating free business competition and the rule of law for a pat on the back. Even the US' highhanded action in pursuing Huawei's chief financial officer has not given these countries pause for thought.  Instead of letting the US tell it what to do, the EU should exercise its own discretion.         "
US stance toward Iran on wrong side of history: China Daily editorial,1/28/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump. [Photo/IC]   A while back, the US president said his country would no longer act as the world's policeman. However, it seems this will be a habit the long-authoritarian Washington finds hard to kick. Certainly in terms of the long-arm jurisdiction it likes to apply on the assumption that by drawing up a domestic law it can dictate to everyone, everywhere, what they can and cannot do.  While the United States can introduce domestic legislation to prevent its own companies from doing business with anyone it dislikes, it has no legal grounds for applying that legislation to non-US entities.  If, based on their relations, the US' allies opt to voluntarily coordinate and side with the US on a certain matter, that is their decision, right or wrong. But no country is under any obligation to observe sanctions unilaterally imposed by the US. So while Washington's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was in blatant disregard of its own international obligations, its latest attempt to deter the European Union from engaging with Teheran is an outrageous transgression.  The White House has warned the EU to not proceed with an alternative payment arrangement mechanism with Iran, saying it would deem it to be in breach of the US sanctions against Teheran.  All the other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal share the belief it is as good as it can be. Which is why, even with Washington gone, they have demonstrated their unanimous commitment to its continued implementation.  Inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency have found no violation of the deal on Teheran's part. In other words, the deal has held on both sides. But although the deal has proved effective, the current administration has not only withdrawn the US from the deal, it continues to pursue a maximum pressure campaign against Iran for reasons originating from previous mistakes and misjudgments by Washington.  Instead of imposing unilateral punishing sanctions, Washington should be thankful that the deal has held. After all, it has put in nothing but has still reaped the rewards of peace. But then maybe, that is not what it wants. After all, as well as stopping Iran building a nuclear bomb, the deal also prevented the possibility of a war with Iran. Destroying the deal would restore that potentiality.  Washington's current approach to Teheran is a dangerous round of gambling that risks not only ruining what the international community has achieved on the nuclear issue, but also further destabilizing the Middle East.  Decision-makers in Washington should know the nuclear deal is only a nuclear deal. Attaching too much to it will simply not work, and punishing the EU for doing the right thing will only end up hurting the US itself in the long run.         "
Better cross-Straits relations can help island boost its economic growth,1/28/2019,"                      Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, speaks at a conference on Taiwan affairs in Beijing, capital of China, on Jan 22, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   A recent online poll showed about 80 percent of the netizens in Taiwan don't believe Su Tseng-chang can significantly promote economic growth after succeeding Lai Ching-te as the island's executive head, according to CTnews, a digital media outlet. The netizens' views are based on the past records of how much positive impact a change in the island's ruling party or ""cabinet"" leaders has had on economic development.  The Taiwan economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 percent from 1962 to 2000, making the island one of the top ""Asian Tiger"" economies, as well as creating an overall affluent society.  But since 2000, when the ""pro-independence"" Democratic Progressive Party assumed the island's leadership for the first time, Taiwan has seen a constant outflow of resources, a slowing economy, a growing gap between the rich and poor, stagnating wages, a widening fiscal gap, and an aging urban and rural society.  The annual growth rate of the Taiwan economy was about 3.4 percent from 2001 to 2008, close to one-third of the rate between 1962 and 2000. What are the main causes of this drastic slowdown? And how can Taiwan accelerate economic growth?  Although it occupies a relatively good position in the global economy, Taiwan is a small economy suffering the disadvantage of limited resources and a small hinterland market.  Therefore, compared with large economies, the island needs to more urgently cooperate and integrate with the world economy. First, it has to introduce more friendly and open policies to improve the investment environment and adopt more liberal trade practices to promote imports. And second, it has to reach agreements with other economies to promote free trade and sharpen the competitiveness of its products in the world markets to increase exports.  The island's economy worked well from the 1960s to the 1990s when the United States, the European Union and Japan were drivers of the world economy, and the Chinese mainland's economy was still to take off. Thus, cross-Straits ties had little influence on the island's economy at the time, and establishing good relations with the US, the EU and Japan was enough for the island to reap the fruits of fast-paced economic development by exploiting global resources and markets.  However, with the rise of the mainland, much has now changed in the world economy. The mainland has become both the ""factory"" and market of the world, and therefore greatly influences the Taiwan economy.  Thanks to successive Taiwan authorities prioritizing politics over their mainland policies, cross-Straits relations have not been normalized, preventing the liberalization of trade across the Straits, which is critical to Taiwan's economic survival.  Deliberately maintaining a distance from the mainland market, the island, unlike in the past, is unable to make good use of world resources and world markets, which have significantly undermined investors' confidence in and outside Taiwan. Plus, the cost of production has been constantly rising on the island, leading to the flight of capital and industries, and the marginalization of its economy in the world.  The shortage of investment and lack of free trade are apparent causes of the slowdown of the island's economy. But the root cause is the uncertainty in cross-Straits relations, for it has prevented the island from fully integrating in the global economic machine.  With economic globalization and regional integration, as well as the growth of the mainland as a major center of globalization, the development of the island's economy fundamentally depends on peaceful and stable cross-Straits relations, and the economic integration of the two sides.  Or else, the island's economy will be further marginalized, resources and capital will keep flowing out, its industrial innovation and economic transformation will slow down further, and the gap between the rich and the poor will widen. As a result, in the next 20 to 30 years, the island's economy would be stifled.  This is to say, for Taiwan, poor cross-Straits ties will lead to a poor economy, and only through improved cross-Straits relations can the island's economy prosper.  The author is the deputy director of the Taiwan Research Center, Xiamen University.         "
External interference only adds fuel to fire in Venezuela: China Daily editorial,1/27/2019,"                          Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro smiles while he speaks during a meeting with youths in Caracas, Venezuela, Jan 26, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   Whatever has happened in Venezuela, it is still a sovereign country which has the say over its own fate. No country has the right to dictate to this nation and its people how to settle its own political crisis.  The US administration, which is averse to Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro, only made the situation in Venezuela more complicated when it announced it recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido, after he declared himself president on Wednesday claiming that Maduro's reelection last year was fraudulent.  Following the lead of the US, the European Union on Saturday gave Maduro an ultimatum to call elections within eight days or it too would support Guaido. An ultimatum that was dismissed as ""childish"" by Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza.  Guaido reportedly met with the government officials on the weekend to convince them of the need for new elections. Although with international support, he has no control of the state, which he is hoping to gain with the promise of amnesty for those who switch allegiance to him.  Meanwhile, Maduro's government has backtracked on an order that gave US embassy personnel 72 hours to leave Venezuela, saying it had opened a 30-day window to negotiate with the Trump administration, defusing tensions between the countries just hours after their top diplomats traded heated rhetoric at a special meeting of the UN Security Council.  Given the increasingly fierce confrontation between Maduro's government and the opposition, it is not just improper but also dangerous for other countries to take sides, as it will only intensify the divisions and may even spark a civil war in the country.  External political or even military interference has the likelihood of plunging the country into chaos. Latin America has plentiful experience of the cost of US-led interference and military ""solutions"" to crises.  For Venezuelan people, violence or even a civil war as a result of the fierce confrontation between Maduro's government and the opposition should be the last thing they want, as it will only plunge the South American country into turmoil and cause even more suffering.  What has happened in Syria in the Middle East, where a civil war has lasted for years between the Syrian government forces and those opposing it, should serve as a mirror to reflect what would likely happen should the situation in Venezuela spin out of control.  If there is a chance for a political process to develop between Maduro's government and the opposition for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, other countries should do whatever they can to promote that process. Even if they find no way to extend a helping hand, they should respect the sovereignty of Venezuela and take no action to intervene.         "
"Ottawa should realize by now, right decision is to release Meng: China Daily editorial",1/27/2019,"                          Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is escorted by her private security detail while arriving at a parole office, in Vancouver, on Dec 12, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The political life of John McCallum, who was the Canadian ambassador to China, took a dramatic turn on Friday after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau forced him to resign for his comments regarding Canada's detention of Huawei's chief financial officer, who is being held by Canada at the request of the United States.  Everybody knows that the US is seeking the extradition of Meng Wanzhou as part of its pressure tactics against the Chinese tech company and China. McCallum was merely stating the truth when he observed that Meng has a strong case against extradition, which he rightly said was politically motivated.  The Canadian government may feel obliged to dance to the tune of the US, and that, in this instance, the bilateral extradition treaty between the two countries gives it an excuse to do so. But it should not let its commitment to Washington confuse right and wrong and even becloud its judgment about what is fair and just.  As McCallum pointed out, the political interference from the White House, the extraterritorial nature of the charges and the fact that Canada is not party to US sanctions against Iran all mean Meng has a strong case against extradition.  In fact, he could have gone further and made it clear that the spurious request for her extradition means she should not have been detained in the first place.  Although what he said is 100 percent true, his words seem to have fallen on deaf ears at home. Those who had attacked McCallum should feel ashamed of themselves.  Trudeau's firing of the ambassador shows how sensitive Ottawa is to the pickle it has got itself into at the behest of the US.  In fact, before the Huawei case broke out, Trudeau had been dedicated to improving bilateral ties, and sending McCallum, an old China hand, to Beijing was part of his efforts.  The US has made it clear last week it will pursue Meng's extradition, so the political mess that Ottawa is floundering in could get a lot worse if it chooses to accede to the US request for Meng's extradition despite the problems with the case that McCallum, among others, has pointed out.  It is high time Trudeau reflected upon whether it is worthwhile allowing the US to lead him by the nose.  The best solution for Ottawa to emerge with any credibility from the mess it has created is to admit its error of judgment and return freedom to Meng. It is hoped Ottawa will make the wise choice, a choice that is based on reason and fairness and not on political calculations of how to best get on with the country's rambunctious southern neighbor.

Long-term efforts must follow health product cleanup campaign: China Daily editorial,1/24/2019,"                          Quanjian (Tianjin) Tumor Hospital. [Photo/VCG]   The ongoing three-month national crackdown on illegal practices in the health products market, which started early this month, is a welcome move.  Problems, such as false advertising, counterfeit goods and poor-quality products, have long existed in this sector and they have become a consistent source of complaints. Many consumers of these products are senior citizens, often with chronic diseases and without much knowledge about medical science, and they tend to easily fall prey to the promotional spiel of the sellers, who may even be part of a scam.  As China enters an aging society, the demand for health products from senior citizens continues to grow. The size of the market — which includes food, equipment and wearable devices — is estimated to already be worth billions of dollars, and it is expected to grow at a double-digit rate in the years to come.  Yet compared with the explosive market expansion, government supervision has lagged far behind, often compromised by a shortage of law enforcement personnel and the lack of coordination among different government departments. For example, it is the public health departments that are responsible for verifying the claims of health food advertisements, yet the right to law enforcement rests with the market regulatory agency. This situation inevitably leads to passing the buck and even neglect of duties.  This explains why Tianjin-based health products giant, Quanjian, could be so successful, before its many irregularities such as false advertising and pyramid-style selling were exposed. The local government conducted an investigation into the company only after a social media post — claiming a 7-year-old girl died after forgoing medical treatment in favor of taking herbal products that Quanjian claimed could treat cancer — sparked a public outcry.  It is unrealistic to expect the health products market will be spotlessly clean and in impeccable order after the campaign. The huge profits to be gained — many products are sold at a price a dozen times their actual costs — mean there will always be those ready to take a chance testing the moral and legal bottom line.  To deter them in the long run, laws must be updated and institutional reform must be carried out to make a national supervision system more responsive and efficient. The China Food and Drug Administration has already established a new department to better manage ""special food"" registration.  Yet more needs to be done, and people need to be better informed of how to live a healthy lifestyle, so they are not so easily duped by the quick-fix claims of false health advertising.         "
China's message in Davos a call for collective action: China Daily editorial,1/24/2019,"                          Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan delivers a speech at the 2019 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, Davos, Jan 23, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   What Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan told the global leaders and business elite attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, was a candid declaration of Beijing's policy and position, as well as a rallying call for concerted efforts to oppose protectionism and unilateralism.  Reaffirming the pro-globalization, pro-multilateralism stance that President Xi Jinping put forward in his widely acclaimed speech at the forum in Davos two years ago, Wang firmly positioned Beijing as a still-steadfast proponent of economic globalization.  China is fully committed to preserving economic globalization and ""wishes to work with all countries for common development"", Wang said. But he made it clear that China will continue to adhere to a development path that suits its own conditions and is in keeping with the trend of the times.  To those listening, his remarks should have made it clear that Beijing wants to work with others for mutual benefits but it will not pander to unrealistic expectations of how it can benefit others.  It has recently been suggested by some in the developed countries that what China has achieved has been purely because those countries and their companies extended altruistic helping hands to raise China up.  That distorts the truth and insults the Chinese people. As Xi said recently, what China has achieved is the result of its own vision, hard work and courage; it is not ""a gift from others"".  He has made it clear that the country will continue to advance reform and opening-up, but it will only change what needs to be changed, it will not change what should or cannot be changed.  Those words may not have been pleasant to some ears. But Wang reiterated them in Davos.  Since the US delegation didn't attend this year's forum due to that country's government shutdown, it is to be hoped that message does not get distorted in its relaying.  With trade talks between the United States and China due to take place next week, a positive outcome requires both to have realistic expectations of what they can take by appreciating what the other can give.  Hopefully, Washington realizes that the Chinese and US economies are mutually indispensable, and as Wang said, their relations must be mutually beneficial and win-win.  Indeed, the frictions between the two countries do not stem inherently from their relations as some suggest, but rather from the problems in the global economy, such as the lack of new growth drivers, unbalanced development and uneven income distribution, as well as the changes being unleashed by new technologies and new industries.  These problems and changes will not be overcome by looking inward since they are universal in nature. The only way to overcome the problems and meet the challenges is to embrace the trend of the times and seize the potential of connectivity and cooperation.         "
US politicians' attempt to play 'Taiwan card' will be futile: China Daily editorial,1/23/2019,"                      In a blatant interference into China's internal affairs, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday intended to promote the participation of Taiwan in the World Health Organization and other international forums. For the House Resolution 353 to become law, it still needs to be passed by the US Senate. Then it will direct the US secretary of state to campaign for the participation of Taiwan in international organizations such as the WHO and Interpol. As such, it is a malicious violation of the one-China principle. The United States should honor the one-China commitment it made in the three joint communiqués that laid the foundation for the two countries to establish formal diplomatic ties and not proceed to make this provocative resolution law. This is not the first time that the US Congress has tried to play the Taiwan card in the world arena in this way. According to media reports, the same resolution was passed by the House of Representatives last year but failed to gain approval from the Senate due to procedural issues. But Washington should know by now that any attempt to internationalize the Taiwan question will be a mission impossible. The UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and World Health Assembly Resolution 25.1 provide the legal basis for the WHO to follow the one-China principle. It will be futile to try and challenge this. Given the sensitivity of the Taiwan question, the US should handle it with caution and refrain from making any moves that may send the wrong signal to Taiwan separatists by encouraging them in their deluded ambition to attain ""independence"" for the island. The Tsai Ing-wen administration has repeatedly tried to gain membership status for the island in international bodies such as the WHO in bid to gain de facto recognition for an ""independent"" Taiwan. Those in the US trying to help Tsai manipulate health fears in an attempt to expand the international space to challenge the one-China principle should listen to the voice of the majority of Taiwan people, who in the island's recent local elections showed they categorically reject Tsai's approach, forcing her to step down as head of her party. It should be clear why Tsai is in such an embarrassing position: The previously cordial relations across the Taiwan Straits would not have come to an abrupt end had she not pursued her pro-independence, anti-mainland policy. Those US politicians, who think playing the Taiwan card in this way will help the US gain leverage in its ""rivalry"" with the Chinese mainland, are only fooling themselves. No matter what the US does it will not be able to brush aside the clear legal status that the island is part of one China.         "
China Daily editorial: Were Pompeo's remarks a sign of greater realism?,1/23/2019,"                          US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is seen on a screen during his address via satellite at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, on Jan 22, 2019 in Davos, Switzerland. [Photo/VCG]   For a fairly long period of time, United States President Donald Trump sounded like he was the only person in the US administration confident the trade talks with China would result in a deal.  However, it seems there are others that share his optimism.  Speaking by video to those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he too expected a good outcome from the upcoming conversations.  Although that shared confidence may be rooted in the mistaken belief that Beijing will have to cave in because the Chinese economy has been taking a battering, the fact that the administration is receptive to reaching a deal, rather than just going through the motions for the sake of appearances, is welcome.  A successful conclusion to the talks would be good news for both sides and inject some much-needed confidence in the global economic outlook.  Whether or not they are willing to acknowledge it, both economies have already felt the effects from their exchange of trade blows, and the prevailing mood in both countries has been that worse is yet to come.  But while they struck a more conciliatory tone, it remains to be seen whether or to what extent Pompeo's remarks represent a break from the previous stance expressed by various Trump administration officials, including himself.  From US Vice-President Mike Pence to National Security Advisor John Bolton, we have heard on numerous occasions the dogmatic assessment that China is a rival that needs to be countered on every front.  But rather than the now-familiar chip-on-the-shoulder message from Washington that the US will go it alone because everyone is out to get it, Pompeo's remarks on Tuesday hinted at a more community-aware, less of a social-misfit approach to relations with other countries.  As he said with regard to China: ""There are those who say that a superpower conflict between our countries is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We want to find places where we can work together.""  Adding the two countries can ""thrive and prosper together"", a message that China has repeatedly tried to get across to an administration that up to now has been hard of hearing.  And it is a message that Beijing is backing up with actions. Washington needs to do the same.  If what Pompeo told the WEF gathering does indicate a change in approach by Washington, it will definitely herald a brighter future for both peoples, and offer some reason for optimism at what has otherwise been a bleak start to the year.  For as the past 40 years of diplomatic relations have proved, differences can be overcome as long as there is the shared will.         "
Shame on Canada for being US yes-man: China Daily editorial,1/22/2019,"                          Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. [Photo/IC]   It was reported on Tuesday that the United States will proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer.  Canada did what the US asked of it in detaining Meng without considering whether it was proper or not to do, so it is anticipated that it will carry on doing the US' bidding, even though its use of long-arm jurisdiction in this way is highly problematic.  If Canada does continue to do what is required of it by the US, it will certainly see its relations with China, including its trade relations, further deteriorate, since it has the choice not to carry out the extradition of Meng on what are trumped-up charges.  Canada has exacerbated the problem it has created for itself by seeking to establish a connection between China's arrest of two Canadians with its own holding of Meng, despite none existing. China has explained that what the two Canadians were doing posed a threat to its national security.  It is even more ridiculous for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to claim that China arbitrarily handed out the death penalty to a Canadian citizen after a local Chinese court sentenced Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death for drug trafficking. Schellenberg was caught trying to smuggle more than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine to Australia, a crime that carries the death penalty according to China's Criminal Law. As does operating an international drug-trafficking operation, a separate charge that Schellenberg was also found guilty of.  Huawei, because of its success as one of the world's largest smartphone makers and telecommunications equipment providers, has become a convenient lightning rod for US anxiety about China's growing technological might. It has spared no efforts in demonizing the Chinese company and even persuaded other countries, its allies in particular, not to use Huawei's products.  The risk of Huawei's products being used for spying is simply a pretext; the US has never found any evidence to support this allegation. However, it has found allies such as Canada that are willing to go along with its pressure tactics against the Chinese company, for reasons of their own.  By detaining Meng at the request of the US, Canada is acting as an accomplice in the US attempt to squeeze the space for China's technological advancement by containing the development of its telecoms pacemaker and even killing the company.  Canada should be ashamed of what it has done with Meng, and realize that it will be the biggest loser if it continues to be the US yes-man.         "
Data indicate pessimism over birth rate unfounded: China Daily editorial,1/21/2019,"                          A mother and her two children. [Photo/VCG]   There has been growing worry in recent years that China's population may have started to decrease, leading to a rapidly aging society. However, figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday suggest that is a pessimistic view, as there were 15.23 million new births last year, meaning the population grew by 3.81 percent to 1.395 billion.  And among the new births many are a second child, which indicates that the change to the country's family planning policy in 2016 to allow all couples to have a second child has proved effective in encouraging more births.  Also that the workforce — those aged 16 to 59 — stands at around 900 million, or nearly 65 percent of China's total population, suggests there are still years to come before the country ceases to reap its demographic dividend, which has often been described as one of the major factors behind China's miraculous economic growth over the past four decades and was one of the reasons for the prescient change in policy.  This, in addition to higher quality workers, as more than 8 million college graduates enter the job market each year, all bodes well for the country's industrial upgrading and economic growth in the long run.  But the latest figures do reveal some cause for concern. That the number of new births last year was much lower than the 17.23 million in 2017 and 17.86 million in 2016 suggests a declining curve in new births that will be hard to reverse.  This means more measures other than the all-couples two-child policy are needed to encourage young couples to give birth to a second child, whose willingness to do so is severely dampened by the costs involved in raising children. The measures should include more child care and early child development services, so as to relieve the burden on parents, as well as strengthened protection of women's employment rights.  The fast aging population now poses a big challenge to China, as the number of people aged 60 years or above accounts for 17.9 percent of the total population, compared with 12 percent only 10 years ago. The proportion is expected to rise to 40 percent by 2050.  To turn the problem into opportunities, the government must heed the alarm bell and make sure it is well prepared with new strategies such as building a well-developed social security system, improved welfare institutions and healthcare centers.

"GDP growth slows, but remains steady: China Daily editorial",1/21/2019,"                          Beijing's Central Business District is seen in this night view of the city's skyscrapers, office buildings and highways. [Photo/VCG]   Despite growing at the lowest rate in nearly three decades given the complicated domestic and external situation, that China's GDP growth was 6.6 percent last year highlights the resilience of the world's second-largest economy, which remains one of the fastest-growing major economies and the largest contributor to growth of the world economy.  Admittedly, on a quarterly basis, the economy grew 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, down from the rise of 1.6 percent posted in the third quarter, and economic indicators such as industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment, all weakened last year, especially in the second half, prompting concerns that the trade dispute with the United States has begun to bite.  However, considering the sheer size of the economy — over 90 trillion yuan ($13.26 trillion) — it is to be expected that its growth rate should slow after decades of nearly double-digit expansion, especially at a time when protectionism is on the rise and the country is making ongoing efforts to restructure the economy to make its growth more sustainable.  Activity-dampening measures, such as cutting excessive production capacity and the closure of polluting factories, have inevitably proved a drag on the Chinese economy, but sacrificing speed for higher quality growth is necessary to secure sustainable growth in the long run.  Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, on Monday listed some of the recent progress China has made in its restructuring efforts: Consumption and the service sector have become the two pillars of the economy, manufacturing technology upgrading is making solid progress and new growth engines, such as e-commerce, have emerged and are expanding.  It will take time for the restructuring of such a large economy to fully take shape. But China is clearly making headway in its ongoing efforts to make the economy more efficient and growth more sustainable.  While the China-US trade dispute has hit investor confidence in the Chinese economy and dampened domestic trade-related activities, thus slowing growth, there is optimism that the ongoing negotiations will result in a deal. Even if the dispute is prolonged, China has plenty of room for policy adjustments and will do so as necessary to mitigate the effects and cope with the challenges.  And knowing that it is in the best interests of the country and its people, the country's leaders have indicated repeatedly that they are resolved to adhere to the course of reform and opening-up. While adopting targeted loosening policies, such as monetary easing to support the real economy, China will also deepen reforms in various fields to encourage competition, protect intellectual property rights, expand access for all types of investors and open its doors wider.  As the data show, the country has the foundation, conditions and capability to keep economic growth within a reasonable range, and ensure sustained and healthy economic development.         "
Trump-Kim meeting must avoid going round in circles: China Daily editorial,1/20/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump shakes hands with DPRK's leader Kim Jong-un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island Tuesday, June 12, 2018 in Singapore. [photo/IC]   There is no guarantee that the announced second meeting the top leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will produce anything substantive, or live up to either side's – or the rest of the world's – expectations.  But that should not prevent us from accepting the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un as another step forward. At least in the sense of keeping the denuclearization process alive.  Despite worries that the United States president's eagerness for a ""win"" may undermine US strategic interests, it may be essential for opening up a new phase featuring meaningful interaction.  Trump needs something worth boasting about as he is under pressure from the partial government shutdown over the funding for his wall on the border with Mexico and the ""Russian connection"" investigation. But Kim also needs a positive outcome, as the DPRK's economy continues to suffer under United Nations sanctions, which simultaneously constrain his rapid détente with the Republic of Korea.  Considering that shared eagerness, the question then becomes whether, or to what extent, Trump and Kim can break the current stalemate at their coming summit.  That the US president agreed to a second summit following a face-to-face meeting with the DPRK's top denuclearization negotiator Kim Yong-chol should be a signal he at least has an idea about what the next steps will be. A second summit ending without any tangible outcomes will put himself in an even more awkward position.  But for this meeting to be productive, the two parties will have to demonstrate a shared political will to get real about what they promised last time.  Things may easily return to the apparently circular quarrel over what constitutes meaningful moves, or reciprocity. That is precisely what this summit should strive to tackle. Without breaking that endless circle, denuclearization negotiations will go nowhere.  For the summit to be worthwhile, the two leaders must make serious endeavors to bridge the gap between their governments' stances on how denuclearization should proceed. Washington's desire for swift, independently verifiable, irreversible denuclearization has proven unrealistic. Pyongyang's calls for reciprocity remain unanswered.  Since Pyongyang has gone the extra mile to prove its sincerity, Washington must consider beginning to reciprocate.  Since denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula appears increasingly likely to be a phased process, it would do no harm to any party for that process to start with the formal ending of the nominal state of war.  That is a very low-cost way to attain a feat of potentially historic importance.         "
Building walls mentality will only lead to confrontation: China Daily editorial,1/20/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump talks with Vice President Mike Pence as he arrives at the Missile Defense Review announcement at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, US, January 17, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   Although it is said to be beyond the Pentagon's technical and scientific capacity, which is what grounded most of Reagan administration's “Star Wars” initiative, some people might ask what it is wrong with US President Donald Trump talking about building an impenetrable missile shield to defend all US territory from ballistic missile threats.  But such an anti-ballistic missile defense system can be compared to a wall in the space, and is yet another manifestation of the philosophy behind all the policies his administration has put forward and implemented on all fronts — hunkering down behind walls.  When it comes to trade with other countries, even with its allies, his administration has built a wall of tariffs as a barrier to prevent imports from other countries. And he insists on building a wall on the border with Mexico.  Instead of stepping out to engage with the international community, his administration is trying to hide the United States behind walls, in the belief that it is making the US an impenetrable fortress. In doing so it feels safe and superior not having to get along with anyone else, and so it is quite happy to lob stones over the walls.  When it comes to Trump's plan of missile defense system which is envisioned as being able to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any US target, it is obvious that it is targeted at Russia and China, as clarified in the 81-page Missile Defense Review that was released by the Pentagon.  Given that the US is very likely to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was signed by the US and Soviet Union in 1987, the US is clearly trying to adopt a confrontational approach in handling of relations with Russia and China.  With the Trump administration pushing too hard on all fronts without leaving room for talks, it is not hard to imagine how Russia and China will have to act in response. And it is very likely that a new round of arms race will start.  Given that some US strategists view the arms race the Reagan administration instigated with the Soviet Union as being the reason for the Soviet bloc's breakup, and given that the Reagan administration seems to have written the playbook for the current administration, the intent is clear.  But things are not as they were then.  The Trump administration should heed the adage about being careful what you wish for, before trying to create another Cold War.  Certainly, such a scenario is the last thing the majority of countries and people around the world would like to see.         "
Outside interference biggest threat to stability in South China Sea: China Daily editorial,1/17/2019,"                      Although China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are on the course to negotiate the text of a code of conduct in the South China Sea, outside forces continue to try and make waves.According to a statement released by the US military on Wednesday, the United States and the United Kingdom conducted coordinated drills in the South China Sea between January 11 and 16.This show of force in the sensitive waters can by no means be interpreted as a goodwill gesture. It only further complicates the situation in the South China Sea and turns it into a potential regional flashpoint.Defending freedom of navigation is the justification given for such military maneuvers in the South China Sea, yet the only impediments to it are such provocative actions. As the world’s second-largest economy, China knows full well how important it is for the international shipping lanes to be unimpeded. But by barging through the door of China’s territorial waters uninvited in this way, the US and its allies force China to shoo them away. Although it is their actions which are unruly, they then create a fuss about how aggressive China is.The US calculations of the risks and benefits of such military provocations have more to do with its own sense of identity and its feelings of insecurity when it is not throwing its weight around, rather than any desire to get involved in regional affairs in a constructive way. The US has found a willing accomplice in the UK, which having hobbled itself with Brexit is desperately seeking a supportive shoulder to lean on, preferably one that will dip its hand into its wallet to extend a token of thanks.Instead of projecting their power in waters thousands miles away and creating an unnecessary ruckus, both the US and the UK should mind their own business. After all, the historic government shutdown in the US and the UK’s Brexit shambles show they have much to do back home.China has made it clear it will not back down in the face of the US and its allies baring their teeth and growling hypocritically about recalcitrant behavior. There is a consensus in the region that interference from outside forces in regional affairs is the biggest threat to peace and stability, as it is habitually and intentionally disruptive. By finalizing a code of conduct for the waters, and enhancing their cooperation in developing the maritime economy, scientific research and weather forecasting, maritime search and rescue, and anti-piracy operations, China and other countries in the region can ensure such outside meddling does not achieve its divisive and disorderly intentions.

Intense anxiety of US leads to witch hunt of Huawei: China Daily editorial,1/17/2019,"                          Visitors are attracted by products at Huawei stand at the International Funkausstellung (IFA) 2017, the world's leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances, in Berlin, Sep 2, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   It may be because of what it has achieved as one of the world’s telecommunications technology giants, of which Chinese people are proud, but Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has become a thorn in the flesh of the United States. A bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of US chips or other components to Huawei, ZTE Corp or any other Chinese telecommunications company that they believe has violated US sanctions or export control laws.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources, that the Justice Department is looking into allegations of theft of trade secrets from Huawei’s US business partners, including a T-Mobile robotic device used to test smartphones.However, the US has done a lot of looking, and from the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, in Canada at the instigation of the United States, to the repeated warnings by the US to its allies not to use Huawei products and not to cooperate with Huawei, it has not provided a shred of evidence to support its allegations. The US politicians may believe that a lie repeated a thousand times will be accepted as truth. But they should know that they will only shame themselves when Huawei proves innocent of all their allegations.As far as the US interests are concerned, they seem to be so paranoid about Huawei and the rise of China that they have forgotten that technology companies all over the world now rely on each other for innovation and development because of the globalized supply chain. No technology company can survive without the procurement of components from others.What the US government and its politicians are doing with Huawei will certainly make things difficult for the Chinese telecommunications giant. But they are also doing a disservice to the development of the telecommunications technology across the world.It may be because its success portends the rise of China as the major rival of the US that some US politicians spare no efforts in demonizing Huawei with a view to strangling its development. But by talking ill of Huawei as a technology thief and a company engaged in espionage on behalf of the Chinese government, those US politicians are politicizing business matters. That will not only sabotage the normal development of China-US relations but also inevitably the progress of the global telecommunications industry.Huawei has 180,000 employees all over the world, participating in global telecommunications construction under different conditions. And according to rotating-Chairman Hu Houkun at a round-table with international media organizations on Dec 18, it plans to launch more chipsets, hardware and software solutions for artificial intelligence to help customers maximize the benefits of 5G technology.And there’s the rub — the US crackdown on Huawei is a politicized attack provoked by the Washington’s paranoia that the US will lose its pole position in the latest technology race.            "
Report fuels worries Washington playing risky game with Taiwan: China Daily editorial,1/16/2019,"                      A Pentagon report on Tuesday plays into the hands of China hawks in the United States by whipping up the concerns about a possible attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland.  Instead of making wild assumptions and sowing the seeds of paranoia, the US should engage in serious soul-searching as its connivance has encouraged those trumpeting ""Taiwan independence"" on the island to become ever more strident in their calls. The report released by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, titled China's Military Power, said: ""Beijing's long-standing interest to eventually compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for China's military modernization."" There will no doubt be those in Washington and the US defense industry rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect it heralds another big arms sale to the island. But the Pentagon is not in the position to make a fuss about China's determination to deter Taiwan separatists. Like any sovereign state, China has a legitimate right to enhance its military capacities so that its defense forces can better fulfill the responsibilities of defending China's territorial integrity. Especially since, as the report itself makes clear, it is Beijing's anticipation that foreign forces are intervening in what is an internal affair that has prompted it to ""develop a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projection"".  Over the years, the US side has played a dishonorable role by encouraging, in both overt and covert ways, those on the island who seek to deny the historical and legal fact that Taiwan is part of China and the two sides across Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China. Apart from selling weaponry to the island and sending its warships to the Taiwan Straits, the US has recently upped the ante by passing the Taiwan Travel Act and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, in blatant violation of the one-China principle. As President Xi Jinping pointed out earlier this month, while reaffirming the mainland's commitment to peaceful reunification, Beijing ""reserves the option of taking all necessary means"" to ensure reunification is not blocked by anyone or any force. Given that Washington seems intent on encouraging the foolish fancy of secessionists on the island, the People's Liberation Army should continue to improve its capabilities so as to maintain a high degree of strategic deterrence against those who might be emboldened to act out their fantasy. Rather than playing up concerns about China's military modernization and indulging itself in distorting China's intentions out of apprehensions that China might supplant its pre-eminence in the region, the US should solemnly honor its commitment to one-China policy and allow no room for ""Taiwan independence"".

"Hard Brexit looms as May offers too little, too late: China Daily editorial",1/16/2019,"                          British Prime Minister Theresa May is seen in Parliament ahead of the vote on May's Brexit deal, in London, Britain, Jan 15, 2019. [Photo/Agencies]   In June 2016 when the British voted to seek a divorce from the European Union, few in the country seemed to understand all the implications of such a transformative move. Which is why there have been growing calls for a second referendum.  The short span of time before Brexit was put to the vote — held about a year after former prime minister David Cameron gave the green light to a referendum in 2015 — means many voters were driven by impulse and emotion, rather than reason, and there was little weighing of the pros and cons of this seismic event.  Ensuring people were well-informed would have been the best defense against them acting in haste and repenting soon after, but then the Brexit vote was never about what was good for the country, but rather a means to try and keep the Conservative Party intact and in power. Brexit has simply picked up a lot of baggage along the way.  The country is about to pay a heavy price for Cameron's gamble, as members of Parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected his successor Theresa May's deal to leave the EU. It was the biggest parliamentary defeat for a government in modern British political history, but it also means the country faces the immediate risk of a ""no deal"" Brexit.  Such a situation could be catastrophic, because it will disrupt trade, slow down the British economy and wreak havoc on the financial markets. The Treasury has predicted a ""hard"" Brexit would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5 percent compared with staying in the EU.  To avoid this worst-case scenario, May has promised to hold more discussions with MPs to identify ideas that ""have sufficient support"" before returning to the parliament with a new proposal on Monday.  But that appears to be mission impossible. It took May nearly two years to craft her EU withdrawal agreement, which she described as ""the best deal for Britain"", and indeed the only deal. Actually, she had already delayed the parliamentary vote, initially scheduled for Dec 11, fearing defeat. If the month she spent since then trying to woo support for her hard-won deal has proved futile, there will be few who will back her to succeed with a second try within just a few days.  And the door for her to seek ""fundamental change"" to the deal so that it could get parliamentary approval has basically been shut by the EU. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the existing deal ""the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal"".  The clock is ticking ever closer to the March 29 deadline, and each passing day accentuates belief a hard Brexit will be the reality. What that will entail no one really knows. So let us join French President Emmanuel Macron in wishing Britain and its people ""good luck"", and hope the same for the rest of us, since Brexit will have far-reaching effects.         "
Opening-up remains right path for progress: China Daily editorial,1/15/2019,"                      In their latest round of talks early this month, China and the United States agreed to further negotiations to work out a deal that will hopefully help put an end to the current trade standoff.  Such a deal would clearly be in the interests of both China and the US as well as global trade and the world economy.  For China, its trade dispute with the US is no doubt a major challenge and one of the harshest it has encountered in recent history. The world's most powerful economy has used its all-around influence to pressure China to toe the line, forcing China to fight back to safeguard its legitimate interests.  China will not be coerced, but history shows that if it handles the challenge properly, it can turn the current situation to its advantage by using it as a means to advance its deep-water economic reforms and opening-up agenda, which will further enhance its national competitiveness.  Over the past 40 years, while carrying out domestic reform, China has also continually opened up its economy to the outside world, a move that has improved its own economic vitality and, at the same time, benefited other economies. Now China and the world economy are deeply interconnected.  But that has not been a case of a simple snap of the fingers and lo and behold the country has become the world's second-largest economy. Take China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, for instance. It marks a milestone in the country's economic history, but before that decision was made, there were many debates over whether the country should take the initiative to become more deeply integrated in the global economy.  Over the past 17 years, the decision to join the WTO has proved to be the right one, and the country continues to adhere to the path of opening-up. Indeed, it is pressing ahead with the implementation of a ""new round of high-level opening-up"".  The latest data show, China's imports last year increased by 15.8 percent year-on-year, significantly higher than its growth in exports, which was 9.9 percent. And China showcased its resolve to allow its trade partners to benefit from its vast domestic market while satisfying its own domestic demand for overseas products by hosting its first international import expo in Shanghai in November. It has also recently shortened the negative list for foreign investment.  Such changes well illustrate the country's commitment to further opening-up, while President Xi Jinping's words in December explain the rationale — ""openness brings progress, while seclusion leads to backwardness"".

Nothing arbitrary about death penalty for drug trafficking: China Daily editorial,1/15/2019,"                          Robert Lloyd Schellenberg appears in court. [Photo from Intermediate People's Court of Dalian city]   Drug trafficking is a felony subject to the death penalty in the Chinese criminal code.  Under Clause 1, Article 347 of the Chinese Criminal Law, those convicted of smuggling, trafficking, transporting, or manufacturing more than 1,000 grams of opium, more than 50 grams of heroin or methamphetamine, or large quantities of other drugs may receive the death penalty.  In fact, not a few have been executed for drug-related crimes, including some foreign nationals.  There have been pleas, protests, diplomatic representations over cases involving foreigners. But neighbored by some drug-producing nations, China has consistently taken a hard line to deter drug trafficking.  With such historical precedents, the death sentence Dalian Intermediate People's Court of Northeast China's Liaoning province handed down after hearing the appeal of Canadian citizen Robert Lloyd Schellenberg on Monday is nothing out of the ordinary. The Canadian citizen was found guilty of trafficking over 222 kilograms of methamphetamine, quite substantially well in excess of the 50-gram threshold for the death penalty set out in Chinese law.  He was also found guilty of operating an international drug-trafficking operation, a crime that independently carries the death penalty.  Yet despite the law being unambiguous on these matters, the case instantly ballooned into something far beyond the crimes and punishment.  The government of Canada has updated, and upgraded an earlier travel advisory. It now rather sanctimoniously warns Canadians traveling to China of the ""high risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws"".  As in any country, the law is the law, and those trafficking drugs in China do so knowing they face the death penalty if caught.  But ignoring the fact that Chinese law clearly prescribes it as a punishment, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a protest, in which he accused the Chinese court of ""arbitrarily"" sentencing Schellenberg to death.  The arbitrary accusation perhaps stems from the Canadian government having a guilty conscience given he was believed to be suggesting that Beijing is using the case to pressure Canada over that of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is in Canada awaiting possible extradition to the United States at the latter's request.  Such speculation is natural given the timing, but there is no evidence that Beijing is playing hostage politics, as some critics claim. Beijing is simply adamantly anti-drugs.  Schellenberg would have done well to heed the words of Justice Neil Brown of Canada's British Columbia Supreme Court in Chiliwack, who on sentencing Schellenberg to two years imprisonment for drug trafficking in 2012, told him, ""Do not ever underestimate the seriousness of this kind of an offense.""  Under Chinese law, Schellenberg has 10 days to appeal the death sentence, nine are left.         "
Trade data shows resilience of the Chinese economy: China Daily editorial,1/14/2019,"                          High-rise buildings in Beijing's central business district, Dec 4, 2018. [Photo/IC]   In yet another sign of the resilience of the Chinese economy, the country's foreign trade reached a historic high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.62 trillion) in 2018, an increase of 9.7 percent from the previous year, according to figures from the General Administration of Customs released on Monday.  That is indeed remarkable given the rising protectionism globally and the ongoing trade frictions between China and the United States, and it reflects how well China has adapted itself to the fast-changing and complicated external situation, with the government providing timely policy support.   Measures already taken range from the ""significant"" lowering of tariffs on imports such as vehicles and auto parts, moves to broaden market access and reforms to improve the business regulatory environment. The recent World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report, which ranks economies based on how easy it is to do business in them, identified China as one of the top 10 improvers in business regulation, rising to 46th compared to 78th last year.  But despite the overall positive picture, pessimists have pointed to the December figures — which show both exports and imports fell, by 4.4 percent and 7.6 percent, from a year earlier — as an indication China's economy may be losing momentum due to weakening overseas markets and cooling domestic demand.   But it is not the first drop in the monthly figures, as the growth rates of exports and imports fluctuate due to seasonal factors, global commodities prices or base figures for the corresponding month of previous year. Actually, China's foreign trade increased quarter-on-quarter in 2018, suggesting a healthy trend.   Of course, uncertainties abound, especially in external demand from traditional overseas markets such as the US and the European Union. That is why China has sought in recent years to explore opportunities in new markets, especially along the Belt and Road routes. Trade with such countries registered faster-than-average growth of 13.3 percent in 2018, indicating they have become a new ""driving force"" for the foreign trade of the world's largest trading nation.  Its trade frictions with the US may continue to be a source of worry — as accentuated by the latest figure that suggests the trade surplus between the two countries rose to $323 billion last year, the highest since 2006. But the impact it will have on its economic well-being is likely to be limited because China's dependence on exports has been declining over the years — from 70 percent in 2007 to less than 20 percent nowadays as the country seeks to shift its economic growth from export-oriented to domestic demand-driven.   And all the economic indicators suggest a healthy Chinese economy — for example, it has registered economic growth in the 6.7 percent to 6.9 percent range for 12 consecutive quarters.   This, together with the latest trade figures, should instill optimism in the prospects for the country's economy in 2019.

US naval operations chief can help keep ties on even keel: China Daily editorial,1/14/2019,"                          Chinese Navy hospital ship Peace Ark arrives in the Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the United States, on June 29, 2016. A Chinese fleet with about 1,200 soldiers and officers arrived in the Pearl Harbor to take part in the Rim of the Pacific 2016 (RIMPAC 2016) multinational naval exercise. [Photo/Xinhua]   Worldwide military-to-military ties are usually a useful barometer for gauging the degree of strategic mutual trust between countries. When bilateral ties plummet, mutual trust between the two militaries will suffer. Hence, the ongoing visit of US Admiral John Richardson, chief of Naval Operations, is naturally being perceived not only as a move taken by the two militaries to maintain and lubricate their channels of communication and dialogue, but also a sign the two countries want to keep a tight rein on their differences.  Since the US side unilaterally initiated trade frictions with China last year, bilateral ties between the two big countries have rapidly worsened. At the same time, due to Washington's increasing perception of China as a strategic rival, tensions between the two militaries have also spiked.  After US President Donald Trump took office, the US Navy has conducted several so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea in an attempt to challenge China's maritime territorial sovereignty and interests.  In the latest of such operations, the US sent its guided-missile destroyer USS McCampbell to sail near the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea on Jan 7. As always, this US action was met with strong opposition from China as it violates China's sovereignty. US operations like this and its close-in surveillance not only cast a shadow over military-to-military ties but also erode the strategic mutual trust between the two countries.  The seemingly inexorable downward spiral of bilateral relations have fueled speculation that a head-on military clash between the two countries is becoming increasingly unavoidable, so even though it is unlikely the two sides will suddenly see eye to eye during Richardson's visit, exchanging views on their respective positions is necessary and of real benefit. For as he said ahead of his trip, honest and frank dialogue can reduce risks, improve relations in constructive ways and help find ways to expand common interests. This is especially true as Beijing has no intention of challenging the US global supremacy.  Frequent contacts at the high level have, over the year, proven to be instrumental in deepening mutual understanding and reducing the risks of strategic misjudgment and miscalculation, Richardson's visit should be no exception and can help ensure military ties provide support for building healthier relations in other areas.  At present, the two countries are pursuing negotiations that aim to put an end to the trade war. At this critical moment, the two sides should seize the opportunity of Richardson's visit to clarify their broader aims and build greater trust.         "
Nabbing fugitives pays off in anti-graft fight,1/14/2019,"                      Sweeping victory is the key expression that was used to describe what China has achieved in its anti-graft campaign in the past years at the current third plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Beijing.  This includes all-out efforts to hunt those corrupt elements seeking shelter in a foreign land, in which other countries have contributed to the success.  On Aug 23, 2018, the National Supervision Commission, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the ministries of foreign affairs and public security, jointly released a notice urging those corrupt fugitives overseas to hand themselves in. In the five months until the end of 2018, 441 such fugitives from 46 countries and regions had been brought back, and among them, 165 surrendered themselves. Some of them were on the Interpol Red Notice list.  If corrupt elements were able to lead a peaceful life in a foreign land, it would obviously set an example encouraging others to seek ill-gotten gains by abusing their power. Whether the actions China takes to hunt them down succeed is therefore of great importance to the country's campaign against corruption.  In the past years, China has launched its Sky Net Action and Operation Fox Hunt to hunt down corrupt elements who have fled to foreign countries with their illegal assets. From 2014 to the end of 2018, China has already brought back more than 5,000 corrupt elements from 120 countries and regions, and among them 56 are on the Interpol Red Notice list.  These efforts aim to finally make officials not dare to, unable to and have no desire to commit any illegal act. It goes without saying that the aim could never be fulfilled unless their last retreat-seeking a shelter in a foreign country-is blocked. So there is no reason why any country should turn down China's request to hand over an economic criminal suspect hiding there.  Now a five-part TV documentary is being aired on China Central Television, which tells how some well-known corrupt fugitives on the Interpol Red Notice list were brought back home to face trial for the crimes they've committed.  Five years ago at the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said that wherever the corrupt fugitives have fled, they will be brought back to face trial, and any foreign country should never become a safe haven for China's corrupt elements.  The documentary shows how these efforts are paying off.         "
Vaccine scandals call for stricter control and management,1/14/2019,"                      Barely five months after it was revealed a key manufacturer had fabricated records regarding rabies vaccines, we heard solemn vows of a nationwide clean-up and promises that similar lapses would not be repeated.  That scandal accelerated the drafting of a law to establish a strict regulatory system covering the research, development, production, distribution and use of vaccines.  If that particular case highlighted the public's distrust of the way vaccines are made and supplied in our country, what has happened in Jinhu county, Jiangsu province, reveals stunning failures in how vaccines are being administered and how urgent it is the proposed law is introduced to impose the ""strictest"" regulations on the production and use of vaccines.  Local authorities in Jinhu have confirmed 145 children were administered an expired polio vaccine, attributing it to ""chaotic management"" on the part of local vaccine administrators in this particular case. But suspicious parents in the county insist that such a mess is longstanding, and involves an unknown number of other vaccines.  As in similar cases in the past, more than a dozen officials have been dismissed, or are under probe. And a broader investigation is to follow.  The local authorities are trying to reassure the public further worries are uncalled for, but unless there is solid proof that this was indeed a one-time mistake as they claim, it will be difficult to convince the incredulous public with vaccination records, because as shown by the earlier scandal, such records are at best poor or misleading, especially when it comes to the production dates, the current focus of public suspicions.  In this instance, it may be that the problem can be traced back to chaotic everyday management at local disease control and prevention agencies, which has much to do with the awkward role disease control and prevention agencies are assigned in the national public health regime.  In that case it will be difficult to determine to what extent responsible individuals, agencies, or institutional arrangements are to blame.  While expired vaccines may not cause direct, immediate adverse health effects, inadequate immunization may expose people to harmful, potentially fatal, medical conditions. So it is natural that people are worried, especially parents.  Each new scandal drains public confidence in vaccines, even the broader authorities. And that long-term accumulation of mistrust may prove very harmful.  Clearly the proposed law on vaccines cannot be introduced soon enough. And when it is, it must be implemented to the letter.         "
Preservation of Tibetan culture linked to its modern development: China Daily editorial,1/10/2019,"                          People wait in line in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. [Photo/Xinhua]   Should the Tibetan autonomous region open up to the outside world?  With China increasingly integrated with the world, which is itself increasingly globalized, this should not be a question. Yet the preservation of Tibetan culture including its local language is often used as an excuse by some in the West to deny Tibetans the right to economic growth and better lives.  Their desire to keep Tibetan culture preserved in aspic does a disservice to the Tibetan people, who, like their counterparts elsewhere, have the right to higher living standards that can only be obtained through local economic development. That explains why the work report the government of the Tibet autonomous region delivered to the local people's congress on Thursday makes it imperative for Tibet to open wider to the outside world.  By better cooperating with provinces and cities elsewhere in the country and further opening up to the outside world through cooperation with Belt and Road countries, the autonomous region would be able to attract more investment and maintain the momentum of its rapid economic growth.  Tibet would not have achieved the 10 percent of economic growth in 2018 without its cooperation with other provinces and cities, and without the 49 billion yuan ($7.19 billion) tourism revenue, an increase of 31.5 percent over that of 2017.  As far as the development of Tibet is concerned, how to achieve a balance between the preservation of its traditional Tibetan culture and improving the living standards of local Tibetans through rapid economic growth is always a concern.  But preservation of traditional Tibetan culture should not mean keeping the region underdeveloped forever and neither should it mean denying Tibetans access to higher living standards and a modern lifestyle.  Without economic growth, Tibet would have no money to preserve its ancient lamaseries and it would be unable to provide for those lamas living in the lamaseries. Without increased revenue, Tibet would not have money to protect its natural environment.  The local government invested 10.7 billion yuan in improving and protecting the local environment by planting trees on the vast plateau in 2018. It has also established several State-level nature reserves to protect the local environment.  Tibetan culture is not frozen in time. Like any living culture, the traditional culture of Tibet has been handed down from generation to generation, and the legacy of the past is now part of modern Tibetan culture, which is oriented toward the future and the rest of the world. A culture can only remain vital by keeping up with the times, otherwise, as some in the West seem to want for Tibet, it becomes merely a curiosity show of how people lived in the past.         "
Shared sincerity sets foundation for a deal: China Daily editorial,1/10/2019,"                      Having exchanged in-depth views on trade and other economic issues, the Chinese and US delegations finally wrapped up their discussions on Wednesday, with both sides agreeing to continue to keep close contact with a view to ultimately solving their differences.  The talks, which were extended for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday, having already continued late into the evening on Tuesday, have eased market concerns that the world's two largest economies would be unable to find a way to end their trade frictions. And Asian stock markets rose on the back of the rising tide of optimism that the two sides will reach an agreement that will stop the trigger being pulled on a further exchange of punitive measures.  The extra day of talks testifies to the complexity of the trade and economic relations between China and the United States. It is unrealistic to expect a quick-fix solution or Band-Aid; it will take time to sort out the many thorny issues between them. This week's negotiations, which both have engaged in with sincerity and goodwill, have offered a good opportunity for the two sides to deepen their mutual understanding and allowed them to expand their common ground. Both sides have demonstrated they are aware that they lose more than gain from being at odds with one another.  The rest of the international community also hopes the two can resolve their dispute since it would help bolster the shaky global economic growth, which, according to the World Bank's latest forecast, could drop to 2.9 percent this year from 3 percent last year.  But optimism must be tempered by realism, as the statement released after the meeting on Wednesday said, the talks have only laid the foundation for solving the problems, which means major differences remain between the two sides. There will need to be more negotiations to carry on the progress made in this week's talk.  However, an early conclusion to the dispute would serve the interests of both sides, as well as other countries, given the impact the world's two largest economies have on the world economy. And the key to unlocking a solution lies in the willingness and sincerity of both sides to seek a solution through equal-footed consultations.  The experience over the past nine months have proved that it is unrealistic for the US to unilaterally force its terms on China with the stick of tariffs while incurring no economic cost to itself.  Such miscalculation should not be repeated since it would not help solve problems but only worsen the situation. Finding a way to exchange mutual rewards rather than punishments will better serve both countries' long-term interests.         "
Beijing's role in peninsula process unvaryingly positive: China Daily editorial,1/9/2019,"                      Kim Jong-un spent his 35th birthday in Beijing. It was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader's first trip abroad in 2019, and he is the first foreign leader Chinese President Xi Jinping has received this year.  In an unprecedented break from Kim's previous visits — this was his fourth to China in 10 months — both the DPRK and China confirmed the visit as it took place.  But even before any additional official information has been received, there has been plenty of wondering, guessing and speculating regarding Kim's latest China visit. Not only because United States President Donald Trump just declared his second summit meeting with Kim may materialize soon, but also because the DPRK leader just threatened to pursue a ""new path"" should the US fail to respond to his country's gestures of goodwill. And because the trip coincided with a critical round of China-US trade negotiations in Beijing. No wonder 9 of the 10 questions the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman took on Tuesday were about Kim's visit.  The US president has tweeted occasional complaints about Beijing not being sufficiently efficient in persuading Pyongyang to denuclearize. But even US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Monday that, ""China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea's nuclear capability."" With the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman summing up China's role as always being ""a positive one"".  Considering the traditional closeness between the Chinese and DPRK leaderships, there is nothing unusual if the two parties compare notes and coordinate positions on matters of common concern. Such a visit is in line with Kim's New Year's Day address, which highlighted ""strategic communication and cooperation with socialist countries"". His three past visits to China occurred prior to his first meeting with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, as well as before and after meeting Trump.  But no observation should overlook the DPRK leader's ambition to boost his country's economy. During his March 2018 visit, Kim visited a Chinese Academy of Sciences exhibition of its research achievements; three months later, he visited a Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences innovation center, and the Beijing Municipal Rail Transit Command Center. This time, he reportedly visited an exhibition commemorating the China's 40 years of reform and opening-up, a technology development zone, and a pharmaceutical factory.  Pyongyang has made clear its intent to shift to economic development, also that it needs assistance in various aspects. Beijing, as a next-door neighbor and longstanding friend, which has maneuvered a rags-to-riches transformation with four decades of reform and opening-up, has a lot of valuable experience to offer.

"Awards show how far China has come, how far it has to go: China Daily editorial",1/8/2019,"                          The National Science and Technology Award Conference is held in Beijing, capital of China, Jan 8, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]    Hybrid rice, high-speed railways, or the Chang'e 4 lunar probe which made an unprecedented landing on the far side of the moon last week are likely what first come to mind when considering China's science and technology achievements.  Yet the names of the scientists and engineers who are behind these scientific and engineering wonders may not necessarily be known to the public despite their distinguished contributions. Thus a grand ceremony has been held each year since 2000 in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to honor those unsung heroes who have helped China stand tall in the world with its scientific knowledge and technology.  On Tuesday President Xi Jinping presented the top awards to two military technology experts, Liu Yongtan, for his achievements in radar technology; and Qian Qihu, for his contribution to national defense infrastructure projects. They joined the 29 elite scientists who have won the award over the previous years.  The high-profile ceremony, and the high prize given — each of the two scientists received 8 million yuan ($1.17 million), 3 million yuan more than last year — serve to recognize and encourage the hard work and innovative spirit of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese scientists who in just several decades have helped build China into a world science and technology powerhouse.  Today, China leads in the world based on many criteria for science and technology performance.  China now publishes more scientific papers than any other country apart from the United States. It ranked second as a source of international patent applications filed via World Intellectual Property Organization in 2017, again only behind the US. And China is also the second-largest spender in terms of research and development, accounting for 20 percent of the world's total R&D expenditure.  Yet this does not mean it will be a smooth path ahead for China to transform its economy into a center of innovation and become a global leader in science and innovation in the years to come.  The setback that ZTE, China's telecommunications equipment giant, suffered after a US ban on the export of US-made chips and other technologies reveals the Achilles' heel of China's quest to master some of the core technologies. Although it is the world's largest semiconductor market, China still relies heavily on imported chips needed for making high-tech products. Chinese scientists have to double their efforts to design a domestic chip if they want to turn ""made in China"" into ""designed in China"" at an early date.  And for that, the scientists have to ensure the fruits of expanded research and innovation are timely industrialized to help production upgrading, and thus propel the economy and better serve society.  Science and technology have been two of three pillars supporting the country's rapid development over the past 40 years of reform and opening-up; they still are the keys to unlock its future.

Spirit of accommodation key to trade agreement: China Daily editorial,1/8/2019,"                      The repercussions from the trade frictions between the United States and China are already giving investors the heebie-jeebies and causing widespread consternation. And with the clock ticking down the days to the March 1 deadline set by the US for raising its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent — which would trigger a full on trade war — if no agreement is reached, the prospects of even worse to come has led to the worldwide air of gloom and doom growing correspondingly.  So, not surprisingly, when US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday that Beijing and Washington would be able to reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"", it raised hopes that the two days of closed-door negotiations that were due to conclude in Beijing on Tuesday would be able to produce concrete progress toward the two sides resolving their trade dispute. Especially, with both sides saying they were going to engage in the talks in good faith.  That air of optimism was boosted by the visit of Kim Jong-un, the leader of Democratic People's Republic of Korea to Beijing, with speculation that it was somehow tied to trade talks.  However, China's Foreign Ministry was categorical in its denial that the two were linked.  ""We don't need other actions to gain the confidence of the US. The US is very clear about China's stance,"" the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.  Certainly, China could not have made its position any clearer. It has stated on numerous occasions that it hopes the two sides can put an end to the ongoing trade dispute because it not only harms the interests of the country and the US, it also disrupts the international trade order and supply chains.  And it has been consistent in advocating discussions to resolve the trade dispute because it believes that friendly relations are precious and should be valued.  However, it has also made it clear that it will not seek a solution to the trade frictions by making unreasonable concessions, and any agreement has to involve give and take from both sides.  It is to be hoped that the spirit of accommodation indicated by Ross' remarks have been carried through in the talks, which were continuing late into the evening on Tuesday.  While it remains to be seen what the outcome will be, the short history of the current trade dispute shows that the frictions benefit neither side and it will be better for them to arrive at a solution in which they trade benefits rather than continuing to trade blows.

White House wakens to reality of Syria pullout: China Daily editorial,1/7/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump announces military strikes on Syria while delivering a statement from the White House in Washington, US, April 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Following United States President Donald Trump's abrupt tweet on Dec 20 announcing the pullout of US troops from Syria, there was no lack of suspicion and criticism.  James Mattis, then defense secretary who resigned after Trump declared that all-important decision on Twitter, was only one of many who had difficulty endorsing it.  Many questions have been raised. Not least about the way a decision of far-reaching strategic significance was made. While bringing US servicemen and women home from the dangerous war zones of Syria does honor another of the US president's campaign promises, giving him one more chance to repeat the claim ""promise kept"", doing it in such a rash manner may create more problems than it solves.  For one thing, despite Trump's claim of ""historic victories"" against the Islamic State extremists in Syria, many at the Pentagon reportedly disagree with the conclusion that the IS terrorist organization has been defeated.  And what has happened in war-torn Syria over the past two weeks following Trump's announcement? Accumulating signs of fresh violent rivalries among different regional actors with conflicting agendas.  Still, withdrawal was the order, and Trump is the US commander-in-chief.  The withdrawal was initially anticipated to be completed within weeks, but it seems that the US leader has finally woken up to the complexity of the matter and has now changed his tune.  While sending White House National Security Advisor John Bolton to the Middle East to assure confused allies and partners, Trump clarified Sunday: ""I never said we're doing it that quickly.""  According to Bolton, US troops will not leave until the IS militants are defeated, and American-allied Kurdish forces get proper protection. The timetable is based on objectives that ""we want to accomplish"", Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem.  If, as he said, the pullout will not occur until the IS group ""is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again"", and security of Israel and other US ""friends"" in the region ""is absolutely assured"", there will be a protracted process ahead. Not to mention US geopolitical concerns regarding Russia and Iran simply will not allow the US to be a disinterested onlooker there.  A rethink on the withdrawal was therefore called for, because ensuring the IS militants are vanquished is necessary for the US to accomplish its other objectives.  Now it is to be hoped the US will be good to its word and not withdraw until the IS group is defeated and unable to revive itself, as eliminating the terrorist group is also the precondition for reconstruction and stability in Syria.

West trying to smear China so it can hold Africa captive: China Daily editorial,1/7/2019,"                          China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi (L) and Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Workneh Gebeyehu (R) speak during a joint press conference in Addis Ababa, on Jan 3, 2019. [Photo/VCG]   In a sign of how it values its traditional relations with Africa, for nearly three decades China has scheduled its foreign minister's first overseas visits of the year to the continent. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has just concluded a five-day African trip, which took him to Ethiopia, Gambia, Senegal and Burkina Faso — from Wednesday to Sunday — once again testifying to what he described as the ""unbreakable"" friendship between China and Africa.  A focus of Wang's trip was to make sure the initiatives proposed at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation covering industrialization, infrastructure, trade facilitation, green development and healthcare will be well implemented. China pledged $60 billion in aid to Africa at the summit as part of its efforts to propel Sino-African cooperation to a new stage, and jointly build a community of shared future for mankind.  Much progress has been made in Sino-Africa cooperation, as evidenced in the 10,000 kilometers of highways, over 6,000 km of railways as well as numerous schools, hospitals, ports and power stations that China has helped Africa to build over the past decades.  Africans can see with their own eyes that the China-Africa strategic partnership is based on mutual respect and benefits both sides. The Chinese experience in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty over the past four decades, in particular, makes the Africans believe that they could also copy a page from China's playbook on sustainable development and prosperity.  But some in the West tend to look at the Sino-African relationship through the lens of geopolitics and view it as part of great power competition, and they try to sow discord between the two sides by describing China's role in Africa as neocolonialism preying on the African economy.  Just last month, US National Security Advisor John Bolton criticized Beijing for using ""bribes, opaque agreements, and the strategic use of debt"" to hold African countries captive to its wishes and demands.  Such remarks are preposterous. Just as Wang refuted: ""Debt in Africa has been a protracted issue left from history. It didn't come up today, still less is it caused by China.""  For instance, the decades of Western aid to selected African countries have not brought tangible benefits to ordinary people. In contrast, China's unconditional cooperation to the continent over the years has brought jobs and much needed funds for development.  Now the Belt and Road Initiative, which is being integrated with the development plans of African countries, will continue to enable the Africans to embrace new opportunities for a better future as equal partners.

Groundless accusations won't help US economy,1/7/2019,"                          An Apple company logo is seen behind tree branches outside an Apple store in Beijing, December 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The White House's reaction to Apple's slashing its revenue guidance for the fiscal first quarter is both odd and unreasonable. Speaking on Friday, the day after Apple's announcement, Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow said China may have ""picked off"" Apple's technology as it was becoming very competitive with the US giant.  Apple did cite an unexpected slowdown in China as one of the reasons for its downturn in revenue, but there are probably a couple of reasons for that: The trade frictions with the United States have damped Chinese consumers' enthusiasm for US products, and Apple has priced its new products beyond the reach of the majority of Chinese consumers. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Chinese consumers are spending less, which is not necessarily true. It is primarily because Chinese consumers have more choices now at every price point.  And the reality is that with the next big thing yet to emerge, the competition is fierce in a market where the existing technology has been around for awhile.  And while Apple's phenomenal success and the smartphone market have been built on the success of the iPhone, the White House might want to bear in mind that Apple didn't invent the smartphone. The first phone to be marketed as such was a model introduced by the Swedish company Ericsson. What Apple did was to give mass appeal to what had hitherto been considered a corporate tool and set the template for all that have followed.  Now when every smartphone is based on that proven paradigm, making wild surmises about successful later comers is not only groundless but also unhelpful for forerunners such as Apple, who need to locate where their problems are and try to find a way to stay relevant to changing consumer demand.  Kudlow's remarks were made just before Chinese and US trade officials are due to meet this week to discuss trade. Was he deliberately trying to exert pressure on China for the talks or is that just the way the current administration is accustomed to thinking?  It is the hope of many that the trade talks between Chinese and US trade officials this week will be able to achieve some progress in bringing to an end the trade frictions.  But to make a deal needs the willingness and efforts of both China and the US. It would be wrong for Washington to think it is only China that is under pressure. If US officials keep pointing accusing fingers at China and the trade frictions continue, both economies will suffer, not only directly but also indirectly, as the global economy as a whole will feel the effects.            "
Exploring outer space for benefit of mankind,1/7/2019,"                          A simulated landing process of Chang'e-4 lunar probe is seen through the monitor at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in Beijing, capital of China, Jan 3, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   The successful landing of China's Chang'e 4 probe on the far side of the moon on Jan 3 marks a significant step forward in the exploration of outer space and paves the way for future space missions.  Unsurprisingly, images sent from Chang'e 4 of the moon's uncharted side, which is never visible from Earth, have drawn acclaim both at home and abroad. Both the country and its people have a good reason to take pride in this pioneering achievement, which contributes to the efforts to learn more about our home planet's satellite, the solar system and the universe beyond.  China's lunar exploration program, named after moon goddess Chang'e, began in 2004, and has included orbiting and landing a probe on the near side of the moon, and bringing samples back to Earth. Following the Chang'e 4 mission, China is expected to quicken its steps in exploring outer space.  In recent years, each significant achievement made by China's space industry has drawn global attention. Although its space industry is comparatively young, China's commitment to the exploration of outer space has always been crystal clear and consistent. It is committed to the principle of using outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes the militarization of or an arms race in outer space. Its door is open to international cooperation in space exploration.  All these should help mitigate global concerns that it is contributing to outer space becoming a new front line for competition and confrontation among countries.  The Chang'e 4 lunar probe itself is a good example of international cooperation: It is equipped with instruments developed by scientists from Sweden, Germany and China to study the lunar environment, cosmic radiation and the interaction between solar wind and the moon surface. Its power equipment is supplied by radioisotope sources of electricity produced in Russia.  Apart from the Chang'e series of probes, China is also looking to cooperate with international partners in other space programs. Last year, it invited all member states of the United Nations to jointly utilize its future China Space Station, which is expected to be launched later this year and brought into operation by 2022.  China's commitment to international cooperation demonstrates its unwavering belief that outer space is a common home for all humanity and that its space dream is part of the dream of all humankind.

Peninsula progress will take more than another meeting: China Daily editorial,1/3/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and DPRK's leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   For much of last year, both United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un were very enthusiastic about their interaction. Until they started bickering about whose turn it was to make the next move and the peninsula denuclearization process stalled, with the two sides pointing fingers at each other's gamesmanship.  But while speculation is rife that this means the peace process is on its last legs, both Trump and Kim apparently feel that there is still life in it.  Everybody seems to have noticed Kim's threat ""to explore a new path"" should the US pursue ""sanctions and pressure without keeping a promise it made in front of the world,"" in his New Year address. And to be wondering what that ""new path"" might be.  But Kim also declared denuclearization was his ""firm will"", and his country ""would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them"".  For anyone concerned about Pyongyang being the source of a nuclear threat, that should be a consoling message. Plus, Kim again displayed willingness to continue engaging with Washington over the future of the Korean Peninsula.  On the other side of the Pacific in Washington, the US president announced receiving a ""great"" letter from Kim, along with the probability of them meeting again.  ""He'd like to meet, I'd like to meet"", Trump said. ""We'll set that up, we'll be setting that up in the not-too-distant future"".  Although Trump stated he was in no hurry, unless the current momentum is badly disrupted, another US-DPRK summit meeting would likely sustain what Trump has said is his ""very good relationship with North Korea"", which is critical to his claim to have made progress in removing a nuclear threat.  It would also serve Pyongyang's needs for peace, economic development and closer cooperation with Seoul. There would be no guarantee of peace if the DPRK returns to a tense standoff with the US, while constructive engagement on denuclearization might be rewarded with precious US assistance in its pursuit of economic progress.  So it would be no surprise if another Trump-Kim summit occurs sooner rather than later.  However, things cannot really proceed far with key US demands remaining unmet and with the sanctions on the DPRK still in place, and since neither side seems willing to be the one to make the required move first, it would be naive to believe another meeting will make a substantial difference, unless somebody comes up with something new.  Both sides should heed the other's rational concerns if the positive momentum is to be maintained this year.         "
It would be great if Britain could step out of the past: China Daily editorial,1/3/2019,"                      Given its coming divorce from the European Union and its desire to show it is its own master, Britain seems to feel the need to demonstrate that its status is not dependent on it being part of the European collective.  But its intended means of displaying its glorious independence in Southeast Asia will only mark it out as a troublemaker.      Britain's Secretary of State for Defence, Gavin Williamson arrives in Downing Street, London, Britain, Dec 4, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   British Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph last week, said Britain would open two new military bases in ""a couple of years"", one in the Caribbean and the other in Southeast Asia with Singapore and Brunei as possible sites.  This would unnecessarily break the current strategic equilibrium in the Asia-Pacific and fuel new tensions at the geopolitical level.  To be charitable, since Britain is hoping for a trade deal with the United States to keep its economy afloat after it severs its advantageous ties with its European partners, the move is perhaps one of desperation rather than malice.  In recent years, Washington has used the regional maritime disputes as an excuse to meddle in regional affairs and a means to create discord, and it has been pressuring its allies to do the same. London will be keen to show it's willing to do so while holding out its cap for pennies.  US President Donald Trump's announcement that Washington would stop playing the self-assumed role as a ""world policeman"" had raised hopes that the US would stop interfering in others' affairs. So Britain's plan to beef up its military presence in the region has naturally led people to think that London, unsatisfied with its previous role as Washington's deputy sheriff, may seek to polish its prestige by claiming the tin star that the US seems to be discarding.  While that is beyond its capabilities, London as Washington's loyal follower has always been willing to do Washington's bidding, so there is no reason to think the new base will not do the same.  To project its power through naval muscle-flexing is a residual of Britain's days of empire when it sent gunboats to convince others that homage was in order. Those days are past.  It is no longer a time when outside forces can impose their will on the region. With the mutual efforts of China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the maritime disputes have not hindered efforts to enhance cooperation in the region.  More important, China and ASEAN members are quickening their steps in negotiating the text for a code of conduct in the South China Sea. Under such circumstances, London's intention to militarize the waters is an error of judgment.         "
China part of the solutions not part of Brazil's problems: China Daily editorial,1/2/2019,"                      In his inaugural address on Tuesday, Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro elaborated on domestic problems as he vowed to rescue South America's largest and most populous country from ""corruption, criminality and ideological submission"" during his term. ""We will re-establish order,"" he declared.  Brazil suffers from infamously high homicide rate — more than 63,000 people were killed last year — is enduring a slow recovery from a prolonged recession, and has an increasingly polarized society between the left and the right. Bolsonaro faces mounting challenges if he wants to deliver on his campaign promise to bring big changes to the world's eighth-largest economy.  That's why many analysts predict that the outspoken leader, who will have to act rationally and pragmatically once in office, may have to backpedal on some issues despite his inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail.  Which may bring relief to those who worry about future China-Brazil relations now with Bolsonaro at the helm. That's because the hard-line views on China he expressed during his campaign made headlines, especially his claim that ""China isn't buying in Brazil, it's buying Brazil"".  Whether that was a total misconception at the time or just a ruse to win votes by whipping up nationalism, it has been encouraging that Bolsonaro has since restrained himself from making such extreme remarks, and he seems to have come to terms with the fact that the smooth development of China-Brazil relations benefits both countries. He later described China as an ""exceptional partner of Brazil"".  As Brazil's largest trade partner, China has been the No 1 destination for Brazilian exports such as soybean and iron ore. Chinese investment has driven growth in Brazil's energy and infrastructure sectors, and China has become a new source of Brazil's much needed financing, especially since the downturn in 2012, when World Bank lending to the region halved. That's why China has been called ""the countercyclical lender and the stabilizer"".  The Sino-Brazilian strategic partnership, which has deepened dramatically in recent years, should be resilient enough to withstand any political scenarios because it has been based on win-win cooperation and mutual benefits, rather than one country taking advantage of the other.  Both members of the BRICS grouping of the world's most important emerging economies, China and Brazil can avail themselves of limitless growth opportunities if they can work together as their economies are highly complementary.  China has never been the source of problems that Brazil faces today, but rather it stands ready to help provide solutions to those problems.         "
Xi offers practical means to inevitable reunification: China Daily editorial,1/2/2019,"                          A gathering to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing Message to Compatriots in Taiwan is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Jan 2, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]   The message to compatriots in Taiwan issued by Beijing on Jan 1, 1979, made clear the question of Taiwan is an internal affair and set out the fundamental policy of striving for peaceful reunification.  In his speech on Wednesday to commemorate the 40th anniversary of that message, President Xi Jinping made clear those two points still hold true today, while adding substance to how that inevitable outcome should be achieved.  China must and will be united, he said, proposing political negotiation and democratic consultation to work out a systematic arrangement for the peaceful development of the cross-Straits relationship.  The Chinese mainland is willing to hold talks with any political parties or organizations in Taiwan on political issues, he said, so long as it upholds the one-China principle.  And, taking into account the reality of the different development paths of the island and mainland over the years, he put forward ""one country, two systems"" as the most practical means for the realization of reunification, stating that the different political systems on either side of the Straits were not a barrier to reunification.  But he warned that neither is it an excuse for the island's secession from the motherland.  Xi issued a stark caution to the current independence-minded administration of Tsai Ing-wen on the island — as well as those foreign forces that have been emboldening her in her secessionist pursuit — stating that the mainland would make no promise to give up the use of military force and it reserved the option of taking ""all necessary means"" against Taiwan separatist activities.  That such a caveat was necessary was evidenced by Tsai's immediate rejection of Xi's proposals and categorical refusal to accept there is only one China.  Taiwan compatriots should realize from what Xi said in his speech that the mainland is sincere and resolute in seeking the peaceful reunification of Taiwan, and that their rights and interests will be fully guaranteed.  They should also pay heed to how Tsai, in her refusal to accept reality, is willing to let them pay the price while she and those similarly inclined negligently seek to live out a fantasy.  That her party took a beating in the recent local elections should have been a wake-up call for them to pull their heads out of the clouds. Instead, puffed up by tenuous reassurances of support, they persist in trying to promote a historical fallacy.  The reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is in the interests of the Chinese people on both sides of the Straits. Anyone or any forces seeking to prevent this are trying to prolong a feud that need not be handed down from generation to generation.         "
Tsai ought to abide by reality island is part of one China: China Daily editorial,1/1/2019,"                          Taipei 101 skyscraper is seen in the background in Taipei, Taiwan, Dec 19, 2018. [Photo/IC]   It should be clear to everybody why Taiwan and its leadership are in such an embarrassing position when it comes to the island's relationship with the Chinese mainland.  The previously warm and close relations across the Taiwan Straits would not have come to an abrupt end had local leader Tsai Ing-wen not pursued a stubborn pro-independence, anti-mainland policy.  Yet ignoring the vote of no confidence in the course she has chosen that was delivered in the recent local elections on the island, there was no indication throughout Tsai's New Year's address on Monday that she has any intention of changing tack.  Rather than acknowledging her administration's poor performance, especially its problematic mainland policies, Tsai told the people of Taiwan that the mistake is the mainland's. Even though before her inauguration, Beijing declared it was willing to deal, even collaborate, with any person or force that subscribes to ""one China"". That was a precious gesture of willingness to bury historical discord and sustain the fine momentum of constructive interaction fostered under the leadership of Ma Ying-jeou of the now opposition Kuomintang.  It is Tsai's anti-mainland, pro-independence approach that brought ties to freezing point. It is disingenuous to fault the mainland for interference when she has severed nearly all the official channels of communication.  But Tsai enjoys drowning herself in her own fantasies.  Ignoring the pressing need to be reasonable, she sounded even more combative.  While brushing aside the clear international legal status of the island being part of China, Tsai called on Beijing to ""abide by the reality"" of the existence of ""the Republic of China on Taiwan"".  Turning a blind eye to Beijing's long-standing promise of a ""one country, two systems"" design for future relations across the Straits, she required the mainland to ""respect Taiwan people's insistence on freedom and democracy"".  Without repenting for her party's and administration's inclination for creating a scenario of de facto independence, she stated the mainland ""must use peaceful, on parity means"" to handle cross-Straits differences.  Taken out of context, Tsai's remarks may sound reasonable and draw sympathy. But anyone who bothers to look into the true causes of the present impasse would see the absurdity of her requests and why Beijing will not forego the use of nonpeaceful means if necessary to prevent secession.  Tsai said her responsibility is to ""find room for Taiwan's development"" in an international environment full of uncertainties. Considering what she said on Monday, as well as what she has done since assuming office in May 2016, however, she is effectively shrinking that very room.         "
"China, US should build on what's been achieved so far: China Daily editorial",1/1/2019,"                      The start of a new year always generates fresh hopes and expectations, and this year is no exception. The leaders of China and the United States have fueled the seasonal sense of anticipation by raising hopes that the tensions between the two countries will be eased.  On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump exchanged congratulatory messages on the 40th anniversary of the forging of diplomatic ties between the two countries, vowing to push for more cooperation and the further progress of bilateral relations.  This came just two days after the two leaders had a telephone conversation in which they expressed their shared willingness for an agreement to be reached in the two sides' trade talks. The working teams of the two countries are actively promoting the implementation of the consensus reached between the two leaders in Argentina last month.  Despite the vicissitudes over the years, bilateral relations have withstood all the twists and turns. And in doing so, the two sides have learned from experience that cooperation, rather than confrontation and estrangement, should be the defining theme for their relations.  Admittedly, bilateral relations have met a strong headwind since the Donald Trump administration — manifesting the anxieties of many in the US at a changing world over which the country seemed to be losing the grip — unilaterally launched a trade war with China and stubbornly provoked it over sensitive issues such as the South China Sea. But experience has repeatedly shown that the two countries benefit from conducting reciprocal cooperation, and both lose if the atmosphere between them turns cold.  As long as both sides bear in mind the larger picture of bilateral ties and opt for dialogue and negotiations to resolve their differences, there is no reason why their relations cannot continue the general trend of increasing engagement that has benefited both countries over the past 40 years.  And at a time when the world is undergoing profound changes and facing rising challenges and uncertainties, a rapport between Washington and Beijing would also be a welcome signal that they recognize that no country can be an island unto itself in today's interconnected world, in which all actions may prove to have the storm-inducing wings of butterflies.  It is to be hoped the two sides can now demonstrate the political wisdom that will enable them to deliver on the welcome sense of optimism that prevails as we enter 2019.         "
US has blotted copybook acting as world's policeman: China Daily editorial,12/27/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump delivers remarks to US troops in an unannounced visit to Al Asad Air Base, Iraq Dec 26, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Whether the world needs the United States to play the role of global ""policeman"" has been increasingly questioned in recent years, as its interventions in the affairs of other countries have consistently done more harm than good.  With US President Donald Trump declaring this week that the world's sole superpower is discarding this self-assumed role, much of the world will feel relieved — at least for a while.  That Trump made public his decision during a surprise visit to Iraq on Thursday is ironically apt as it is a country that still bears the scars from the US' heavy-handed policing.  In fact, the US interference in Middle East countries such as Iraq, Libya and Syria has been a major factor behind the rise of terrorist groups, especially Islamic State and al-Qaida, in the region. As such, many people will consider the world to be a safer place without the US patrolling the beat.  The US' policing of the world has never been driven by altruism. It has always acted to protect its own interests and project its power across the world. So even if it turns off its sirens, the US will resort to other means to pursue its own interests and agendas.  But at least the world now has a better chance to rally more agreement on how best to maintain peace and stability.         US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet military personnel at the dining facility during an unannounced visit to Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, Dec 26, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   To retain its global supremacy, the US has established a network of alliances made up of countries to which it offers a security umbrella in exchange for support of its policing. With it no longer willing to be the ""policeman"", that umbrella will now come at a price. Those countries being asked to pay should consider the true costs of doing so.  With a new year just around the corner, they should embrace equality, mutual respect, noninterference and win-win cooperation for shared security.  The US, on its part, instead of taking every opportunity to flex its muscles and continually trying to impose its will by force, should accept it is a member of a global community and shoulder its responsibilities by contributing in a constructive way and working with others to ensure it is a safe and secure community for all.  So the question is not whether or not the US should be the global ""policeman""; clearly it shouldn't, since it is only seeking to protect and serve itself.  Instead, the question we should be trying to answer is how can we improve the global governance system to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations, which was established to harmonize the actions of nations for the attainment of peace and stability for the common good.

Constructive China-Japan ties help build community spirit: China Daily editorial,12/27/2018,"                      In a sign of continuously warming relations between Beijing and Tokyo, Japanese naval forces are reportedly expected to send warships on a courtesy visit to Qingdao next April, to take part in the parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Liberation Army's Navy.  In reference to the planned visit, the first of its kind in seven years, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday that more military exchanges between the two countries are beneficial for both sides to ""properly handle disputes and consolidate mutual trust in security"".  The move toward restoring normal military contacts comes as the two sides have just concluded consultations on the creation of a maritime and air liaison mechanism to help avoid any misunderstanding or misjudgment. The two countries are yet to resolve the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands in East China Sea, and the liaison mechanism will be an effective means of reducing the risks of any untoward incident happening.  For the two close neighbors, nothing can better commemorate the 40th anniversary of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship this year than their markedly improved ties, the outcome of the leaders of both countries seeking common ground with a view to the future.  However, the intensifying competition between China and the United States is complicating the situation in Asia. As are the concerns of India, which viewing China as a security threat is trying to strengthen ties with Japan. Tokyo should bear in mind that deepening Japan's economic cooperation and its political dialogue with China and working to maintain peace and stability in the region is the best way to serve Japan's economic and security interests.  As the world's second- and third-largest economies, China and Japan can only gain by focusing on collaboration, especially in an era of turbulent global economy that is being threatened by the rising tide of protectionism and anti-globalization.  By putting aside their differences and deepening their engagement, the two countries can set a positive example for the region by rejecting the selfishly transactional approach of the US in favor of joint efforts to promote an Asian community with a shared future.  They should seek to speed up talks on the three-country free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and take advantage of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative to jointly pursue infrastructure projects in countries along the routes. The lack of infrastructure remains a bottleneck for development in Asia.  Despite the complex regional situation and the attendant uncertainties, Chinese and Japanese leaders should endeavor to build on the hard-won improvement in their relations.         "
Reports of anti-Christmas bias are simply humbug: China Daily editorial,12/26/2018,"                          A Christmas-themed area in a shopping mall in Jinan, East China's Shandong province. [Photo/IC]   In what has become traditional season's greetings, every year about this time, there are Western media reports about China pushing back against Christmas.  They cite as ""evidence"" for this rumors about local officials forcing the removal of Christmas decorations or Christmas-related goods.  That the government in Langfang, Hebei province, was banning Christmas goods was one such rumor, which is a misrepresentation of a local pre-holiday campaign aimed at street peddlers' unauthorized occupation of public spaces.  These reports turn a blind eye to the ubiquitous Christmas decorations and festive dining in many cities.  Such biased reports simply serve as a means to reinforce the stereotype the West is trying to peddle of the atheist Chinese authorities being anti-religion.  Not to mention that such reports feed the misperception that an increasingly assertive China giving a cold shoulder to the entire West. No wonder the otherwise easily dismissed rumors have found some receptive believers this time — despite the Chinese government having clearly affirmed its commitment to the rule of law, and the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of religious belief.  In fact, the government has no reason to throw a wet blanket over the festive season. Why would it, especially when so much of its appeal is material.  But there is the rub, while people enjoy it as another opportunity to have a good time with friends and family, and retailers and hospitality companies like it, there are others who decry it for promoting consumerism.  And that being said, there can be no denying there have long been mixed views toward Christmas in the Chinese society as it has grown more visible. A few people even appeal for a boycott, hoping to make it a test of ""Chineseness"".  A video clip showing children swearing allegiance to traditional Chinese holidays and opposition of Western ones went viral online.  But that is not representative of the nation as a whole. Some people, perhaps even certain local officials, may dislike Christmas. But they are not the majority.  There is no way the government would embrace or promote xenophobia, as to do so would only end up hurting the nation itself.  Given the country's need and its resolve to further open up, suppressing Christmas celebrations in the country would only create an image of narrow-minded nationalism.  And one of the lessons from China's success story over the past four decades of reform and opening-up has been the importance of fostering cultural inclusiveness.  Which is why China has vowed to embrace ""the cream of all human civilizations"".  We should take pride in our own. In February, there will be activities and celebrations in cities around the world to mark the Chinese New Year. This festival is becoming increasingly visible in the West as more people around the world want to experience Chinese culture.  Making our own traditional holidays more popular overseas is more desirable than boycotting a Western holiday here.  Beijing knows that.         "
China working with UN in pursuit of common good,12/26/2018,"                      As an international body charged with the mission of maintaining world peace and development, the United Nations cannot operate without financial support from its member countries. And as a firm defender of multilateralism and a beneficiary of globalization, China knows how important it is to safeguard the current world order in which the UN plays an indispensable role.  China is aware how important it is that it does its bit to ensure the UN can fulfill its missions, and knows that this is an obligation it must fulfill for the benefit of all.  And Chinese people can take pride in the fact that the country has overtaken Japan to be the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget. Since how much a country pays to the regular budget of the United Nations is a benchmark on how powerful the country is, at least financially.  It is therefore natural that China's contribution to the UN budget should rise from 2.05 percent in 2005 to 12.01 percent this year. That hike is an indicator of what the country has achieved over the past 13 years.  In addition, China is now the second-largest contributor to the UN's peacekeeping expenses, to which China contributes 15.22 percent. And China also provides the largest number of peacekeeping troops among the permanent UN Security Council members.  It took three decades for China's economy to jump from being the tenth-largest in the world to the second-largest. And apart from its reform and opening-up policies, the international environment has provided the country with the window of opportunity it needed for its economic development. With the country's further development, there is no doubt that its financial contribution to the UN will continue to rise. China will pay as it should.  However, the more money a country pays, the more responsibility it shoulders and more say it is entitled to enjoy as a major player on the world stage. But the reality is that the rights and international standing China enjoys are still disproportional to what it does for the UN and its contribution to the development of the world economy.  As a responsible member of the international community, China is striving for reform of the UN and the global governance system so they are more effective and representative of the international community as a whole.  Although peace and development remain the themes of the times, uncertainty and instability are on the rise. With this in mind, all countries should make concerted efforts to deepen understanding, enhance trust and promote cooperation. China is committed to building a community with a shared future for humanity and will continue to work with the UN to realize that vision.         "
New negative list nails down rules nationwide,12/26/2018,"                          Containers are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port in Shanghai, April 24, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The rolling out of a negative list for market access nationwide on Tuesday is another significant move to open up the Chinese market to domestic and overseas investors.  Many foreign companies with investments in China have gained handsomely from the country's economic development. Still, some foreign enterprises have complained about a lack of unified regulatory rules that they can follow when doing business in the country.  Without such rules, they say, they do not know which industries they can invest in and which they cannot, and they can be subject to the willful regulatory moves of some local government agencies.  The release of a nationwide negative list for market access will solve this problem and protect the legitimate interests of all types of enterprises, thus promoting a fair and healthy business environment.  Applicable to all types of companies, whether foreign, private or State-owned, the negative list outlines sectors, fields and businesses off-limits to investors.  China has made continual efforts over the past 40 years to open up its economy to foreign investors and allow private enterprises to grow as it builds its socialist market economy.  As part of these efforts, the government started to pilot the negative-list approach in 2016 in the country's four provincial regions with free trade zones, and the pilot was extended to another 11 provincial regions last year.  The new national negative list system is not a makeshift move, it is part of the country's efforts to build a more accommodative and consistent rules-based socialist market economy that provides a level playing field for all investors. Such negative lists are already in place in many advanced economies such as the United States, Japan and the European Union.  It is anticipated that China's national negative list will boost investor confidence and so help usher in more capital from foreign investors and encourage domestic companies to make investments. Especially since the unified regulatory system reduces the number of areas prohibited to investors.  The formal version of the negative list for market access consists of 151 items and 581 specific rules, down by 177 and 288, respectively, compared with the previous draft, testifying to the country's willingness to open up its economy wider and allow the market to play a larger role in the allocation of resources.  In this vein, officials have reportedly vowed to further shorten the negative list and it is expected that the country's regulatory regime for investments will be liberalized further.         "
West's double standard on display once again: China Daily editorial,12/24/2018,"                          Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, right, arrives at a parole office with a member of her private security detail in Vancouver, BC, Canada on Wednesday December 12, 2018. [Photo/IC]   Canada is seeking support from its Western allies in an apparent attempt to exert greater pressure on China over the latter's detention of two Canadian citizens. So far, both the United States and the European Union have chosen to side with Canada. But just like truth does not automatically lie with those who speak the loudest in a quarrel, this does not mean their demand is reasonable.  China's Foreign Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that compulsory measures have been taken in accordance with the law against two Canadian nationals, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as they are suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China's national security.  Prior to that, on Dec 1, Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, at the request of the US authorities. Canada has demanded immediate release of its own citizens who are suspected of breaking China's laws while so far ignoring China's rightful demand to release Meng who has broken no Canadian laws.  The entirely different stance taken by Canada and its Western allies on the two separate cases has laid bare the double standard those countries tend to apply in international relations.  For one thing, the treatment toward Meng upon her detention was is a blatant violation of Meng's rights, and runs counter to what Western countries continually preach on human rights issues in the world arena.  Over the years, Western countries have dressed themselves up as guardians of international human rights, but the detention and treatment of Meng has exposed their hypocrisy and double standard in this regard.  Meng was detained allegedly on charges that she and her company misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. But international practice shows similar disputes were usually resolved through business means.  The two Canadians were detained on suspicion of violating China's national security, and the Chinese authorities would not have taken measures without solid evidence. But out of the Western bias against China, these two cases are being used as an excuse to criticize China's legal and business environment.  This is self-evident in the EU's statement, which says: “The declared motive for the arrest and detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both Canadian nationals, raises concerns about legitimate research and business practices in China.”  Western countries' resorting to such a double standard does not help resolve the current skirmish between China and Canada. They need a just and objective lens to see through the disputes which was started by the US in the first place.         "
Confidence booster for foreign investors in China: China Daily editorial,12/24/2018,"                      No one questions the vital role the 950,000 foreign-funded enterprises registered in China have played in driving the country's miraculous economic and social development over the past four decades. In Shanghai alone, such companies, whose number accounts for only 2 percent of the city's total, contribute about 27 percent of the economic powerhouse's GDP; and nationally, foreign-funded companies account for 10 percent of China's employment, 20 percent of its tax income and nearly half of its foreign trade. Thus it is not surprising that the Chinese government has always sought to protect and promote foreign businesses in the country, by providing them with fair treatment and a level playing field. In the latest move to serve that purpose, a draft law on foreign investment — to replace three existing laws, namely, on Chinese-foreign equity joint ventures, nonequity joint ventures (or contractual joint ventures), and wholly foreign-owned enterprises — has been submitted for approval to a bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the top legislature, which opened on Sunday. The draft seeks to boost foreign investors' confidence in the Chinese market by streamlining the rules governing foreign investment and broadening market access for foreign investors, and addressing concerns such as the forced transfer of intellectual property. Obtaining required licenses can be a headache for foreign investors, as under the existing laws most foreign investment projects are subject to lengthy, and sometimes cumbersome, approval procedures. The draft law will be a painkiller as only those projects in restricted sectors — as set out in a negative list — will need to obtain a market entry permit. And it should be pointed out that China unveiled a shortened negative list in June. The number of items on the list was reduced from 63 to 48, and officials have pledged to further shorten it next year to open up more sectors to foreign investment. To strengthen property rights protection, the draft prohibits government departments and officials using administrative means for forced technology transfers and stipulates that technological cooperation concerning foreign investment be decided by all parties concerned through negotiation. The measures to ease market entry are the result of the government's steady and thoughtful process of experimentation and adjustment, and benefit both the Chinese economy and foreign investors by providing a sound investment environment and predictable growth prospects for foreign investors.

Resolve for high-quality growth tops the agenda: China Daily editorial,12/23/2018,"                          Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the annual Central Economic Work Conference in Beijing. The conference was held in Beijing from Dec 19 to 21, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   Tenacity is the term President Xi Jinping used in his keynote speech at the Central Economic Work Conference on Friday to emphasize how China’s economy can maintain its momentum. And despite the risks and uncertainties the Chinese economy faces at home and abroad, the conference said the prospects of better quality economic development and social progress are high.  The economic situation at home and abroad could not have been more complicated and difficult. The trade frictions with the United States, drop in commodity prices and slower global growth among others have taken a toll on the economic growth of many countries including China.  That China has maintained healthy economic growth has helped it to cope with the external challenges, realize the goals of macro-regulation relatively well, and make excellent progress in the battles against major risks, poverty and pollution.  Since the focus on high-quality growth has paid high dividends, promoting high-quality development of manufacturing will be beneficial to overall economic growth. The steady increase in investment in manufacturing, services, high-tech and equipment producing industries, along with the low unemployment rate speak volumes of the tenacity of China to maintain stable and quality growth.  True, China has enough reason to be optimistic about its economy, not least because globalization will continue to expand despite some countries’ protectionist and unilateral trade policies. But having a window of opportunity for development is one thing, seizing it is another. Cautious optimism is therefore called for, especially because getting the governments at all levels to implement all the policies to the letter is not an easy task.  Which is important given the framework for the economic growth plan for next year emphasizes that fiscal stimulus will come from local governments and monetary policy through direct financing to private enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.  Domestically, as long as China continues to upgrade its economic structure for quality growth — driven by innovations in science and technology, and further tapping of various sectors’ potential — its development will continue to offer opportunities for the Chinese economy as well as other economies.  But to tap the potential for development by furthering reform and opening-up, local governments need to locate where the benefits of reform and local residents’ interests converge and how the latter can be mobilized to push ahead reform.  As such, tenacity will help China maintain steady and healthy growth provided all the local leaders sincerely and honestly implement the policies in the way they should.         "
Africa not a battlefield for major power geopolitics: China Daily editorial,12/23/2018,"                          Three men head north towards Algeria after crossing the Assamaka border post in northern Niger on June 3, 2018. [Photo/IC]   Would Africa have attracted such intense global interest had China not worked for mutual benefits with its partners there? The question deserves special attention.  Increasingly, the long-neglected continent is seen as a land of boundless opportunities, which is good both for overseas investors and the African people.  With its rich resources, relatively cheap labor, and unfathomable potential demand, Africa could be the last frontier of traditional development models promising lucrative returns for international investors. Foreign capital, technologies and management expertise will in turn inject vitality into Africa's economies, and ultimately improve the livelihoods of the people there.  With what it has learnt from its own reform and opening-up, China is engaged in mutually beneficial cooperation throughout Africa. This cooperation has yielded rich fruits thanks in part to China's longstanding policy of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, as well as to the historical friendships cultivated over the past decades.  Allured by the rich prospects Africa offers, an increasing number of developed countries are turning to the continent, promising handsome inputs — only that they are not just regular foreign investors eyeing profits but have the common goal of countering China's influence there.  For instance the United States administration not only defines Beijing as Washington's foremost ""rival"", but also has repeatedly declared its resolve to take on China. And US National Security Advisor John Bolton has just pledged to respond to ""predatory practices"" of China in Africa and safeguard US interests there.  Even the European Union has jumped into the fray promising more investments in Africa to balance Chinese influence. At the 2018 Africa-Europe High-Level Forum in Vienna last week, EU officials were heard echoing Washington's allegation that Chinese investments are increasing Africa's debt burden, and vowing to not ""leave"" Africa to China.  Which prompted Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union Commission chairman, to express worry that market competition in Africa is being seen through the prism of major power geopolitics. ""We choose our partnerships, and create conditions based on mutual interest and benefit. Do not infantilize an entire continent,"" he said.  Rwanda President Paul Kagame (who is also AU president) reinforced the message, saying Europeans need to see Africans as partners, not beneficiaries of their generosity. ""…we should have a conversation about how what Africa brings to the partnership and how what Europe has been offering can be offered differently, so that we get the results we want,"" Kagame said.  Indeed, Africans know what it is in their best interest.  And it would be sad if Africa becomes a new playground for major power geopolitical confrontations.         "
"It's time for peace, stability in Syria: China Daily editorial",12/20/2018,"                          In this file photo taken on March 5, 2017, a convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij. [Photo/VCG]   Washington's decisions regarding the Middle East have a tendency to leave chaos and destruction in their wake, as they are usually both self-serving and shortsighted. It is to be hoped the latest proves to be an exception.  Although a complete withdrawal from Syria has been his long-stated mission, it still came as a surprise when US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he is pulling all US troops out of the country. He had just broadened the US objectives in Syria from fighting the Islamic State group to wiping out all proxy forces in the country earlier this year.  And although the United States now only has about 2,000 troops in Syria mainly on a train-and-advise mission to support local forces fighting the Islamic State group, their withdrawal will still have geopolitical significance.  The decision, which overtly at least is based on the conviction that the IS group has been defeated in the country, ignores the assessments of his own experts warning that is not the case.  Just two weeks ago General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there was still a long way to go to prevent a resurgence of the IS and stabilize the country.  The very fact that military action against the extremist group was needed is a lesson to be heeded. Whether the US had a solid reason to launch its invasion of Iraq aside, its hasty withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 left a security vacuum that was exploited by terrorist groups, most successfully by the IS group.  Iraq is still mired in security woes since the premature US pullout and it is to be hoped that the US in withdrawing will not complicate the situation in Syria by encouraging others to act on its behalf.  Compared with 2014 when the US, leading an international coalition, started to launch airstrikes against IS targets in Syria, the situation in Syria has dramatically changed.  Syrian government troops, backed by Russia and Iran, have regained most of the territories seized by IS terrorists this year. With the US signaling it has less interest in the situation in Syria, there may be a greater chance of a political solution to end Syria's seven-year crisis.  The international community should step up efforts to push for peace and national reconciliation.  Meanwhile, the US withdrawal from Syria should not be the end to the multilateral efforts to counter terrorism both in Syria and elsewhere. Those efforts should never stop.         "
US doubles down on a bet of folly: China Daily editorial,12/20/2018,"                          People wait in line in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. [Photo/Xinhua]   With the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 now signed into US law, the already rocky China-US relationship just got an additional flashpoint.  The Act seeks to promote access to Tibetan areas of China for US diplomats, journalists, and tourists by denying entry into the United States for Chinese officials allegedly responsible for restricting their access to Tibet.  This, as the Foreign Ministry angrily retorted, is a ""totally groundless and absolutely unacceptable"" move.  Groundless because plenty of foreigners, among whom some 40,000 were Americans, have visited Tibet since 2015.  Unacceptable because the Act ""grossly interferes with China's internal affairs, and violates the basic norms of international relations"". The former in particular.  Request for reciprocity is nothing unusual in negotiations between countries over privileges for each other's citizens in people-to-people exchanges. But the masterminds behind the Act have ignored the common sense that reciprocity grows best as an outcome of common consent, and when based on mutual respect.  Beijing's furious initial responses reveal the political naivety of those hoping to coerce Beijing into budging on such a sensitive and critical internal affair.  With long and constantly refreshed memories of foreign interference in its affairs, present-day China cherishes a particular aversion to it, among which interferences related to Tibet and Taiwan have become prominent in recent times. This to Chinese minds is a continuation of the historical interferences by foreign powers in its affairs.  The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 and the Taiwan Travel Act, passed earlier this year, serve as nothing but moves of folly as they send the wrong signal encouraging those secessionist forces seeking ""Tibetan independence"" and ""Taiwan independence"".  Some US politicians, preoccupied with addressing international issues with domestic laws, have taken the wrong way in pointing their fingers at China and trying to force their terms on it.  Tibet is open and will open wider to the outside world. But everything will proceed to Beijing's agenda, not that of Washington.  The two acts show that as well as its trade attacks, Washington is intent on putting pressure on Beijing by all means possible.  With Washington favoring a confrontational approach aimed at maintaining its hegemony rather than a cooperative one for the common good, Beijing will have to be prepared to stand its ground and respond as necessary to safeguard its core interests.

Huawei victim of US panic attacks: China Daily editorial,12/19/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.  Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.  In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.  Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.  Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.  As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.  None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.  It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.  While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.  In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.  The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks.         "
Washington's militarization of space will ignite arms race: China Daily editorial,12/19/2018,"                      Washington seems intent on getting its kicks by trying to relive the good old days. If that just involved it rambling on about ""America first"" it could just go in one ear and come out the other. Unfortunately, it also insists on trying to act as it did in the past.  In a dangerously bastardized version of the country's Sputnik moment, US President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Tuesday authorizing the Department of Defense to create a new Space Command.  According to Vice-President Mike Pence, it will be tasked with developing ""the space doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures that will enable our war fighters to defend our nation in this new era"".  Trump has been pushing to establish a US Space Force by 2020, believing that ""space is a war-fighting domain just like the land, air, and sea"". It wasn't, but obviously the United States wants to make it one.  The professed zeal by the world's sole superpower to turn space into a potential war front will definitely deal a heavy blow to the decades-old international efforts to foster the peaceful use of space.  It runs counter to the spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty — to which the US is a signatory — which declares space a demilitarized zone and the moon and other celestial bodies ""the province of all mankind"".  Of course that treaty, given its deficiencies, is far from enough to guarantee the peaceful use of space, as it only partially restricts military use of space.  That is why countries, including China, and scientists have long sought an arms control regime for space to prevent a conflict in space and outlaw the threat or use of force against man-made objects in outer space or to countries from space.  It is the US that has rejected any arms control agreements for space, as it seeks to remain at the forefront ""technologically and operationally"" in space, as it has in the air, on land and at sea.  It is with this aim in mind that the US keeps harping on the increasing space capacity of the countries it deems to be its adversaries — countries such as China, which has the capacity to shoot down satellites — so as to justify its Space Force program.  It is the consistent stance of China and other space capable countries that outer space should not be militarized and countries should instead work together to explore it and discover more about the Earth and the universe we live in.  A Space Force shows that there are some in the US who have taken Star Wars a little too much to heart.         "
"Policy paper reaffirms Beijing and Brussels can, should stand together: China Daily editorial",12/18/2018,"                      As major participants in, and contributors to, world multi-polarity and economic globalization, China and the European Union share extensive common interests in strengthening their partnership, upholding the global trade system and promoting sustainable development.  Although their political systems and cultures differ, China and the EU have learned to bridge their differences through dialogue and negotiations, and developing sound relations has long been a shared foreign policy priority.  This year marks the 15th anniversary of their comprehensive strategic partnership and the 20th anniversary of the China-EU Summit, and China issued a policy paper on the European Union on Tuesday, its third since 2003, which underscores how importantly it regards its reciprocal cooperation with the bloc.  The paper reaffirms China's support for the European integration process, and its commitment to developing ties with EU institutions, member states and other European countries ""in a comprehensive, balanced and mutually reinforcing manner"", including with the United Kingdom, whose exit from the bloc it hopes will be orderly.  However, it points out the key to long-term stability and growth of China-EU relations is in the EU's hands since it requires the bloc to continue to uphold the one China principle with concrete actions and respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Clearly, as with other parts of the document, such as the call for the EU to keep its market open, reduce and eliminate investment hurdles and discriminatory barriers, this comes in light of the actions of the current US administration.  The ""America First"" policy of the Donald Trump administration has been testing the ties between Beijing and Brussels, as both are navigating their relations through the new uncertainties and challenges created by Washington's attempts to contain China.  But aside from their robust cooperation in trade and people-to-people exchanges, Beijing and Brussels hold similar views on many major international issues, and it is Washington that is alienating itself from the international community with its attempts to dictate who can be friends with whom.  Both staunch supporters of multilateralism, globalization and free trade, Beijing and Brussels can be an important force to counter unilateralism, anti-globalization and trade protectionism, which is being practiced and fueled by the US.  The new policy paper shows that China is viewing its relationship with the EU from a strategic and long-term perspective and it hopes the EU will do likewise.         "
Reform and opening-up start over in a new era:  China Daily editorial,12/18/2018,"                          China holds a grand gathering to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the country's reform and opening-up at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, Dec 18, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   In his 100-minute, 13,000-character speech addressing the official commemoration of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, President Xi Jinping offered what is to date the most comprehensive elaboration of the latest proposal for the 40-year-old cause to ""start over"".  That, according to Xi, means to press ahead with reform and opening-up with a new-found confidence and sense of direction. Which boils down to a deeper conviction in the continuous indispensability of reform and openness as well as a continuous commitment to doing it the right way.  No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done, Xi said, making it clear that the country will change what should and can be reformed, but it won't change what shouldn't and can't be.  Commemorating China's transformative journey over the past 40 years is more than just marking the milestones, it is also about carrying forward what this nation of over 1.3 billion people has learned in the process.  In particular what the Communist Party of China has learned through its ""great awakening"", an awakening that 40 years after it began, continues.  ""Only when conforming to the trends of history, actively responding to changes, spontaneously seeking changes, can we advance with the times,"" Xi said. And in the CPC's understanding, China can contribute more to the world by being the guide for countries to build a community with a shared future for humanity.           "
Washington must recalibrate perception for shared future: China Daily editorial,12/17/2018,"                      In March, China woke up one morning to find that without having done anything truly wrong, it was to be severely punished.   The judgement highhandedly handed down on the 22nd was a sad indictment of the current US administration's lack of appreciation of what has been achieved over the past 40 years — both in terms of bilateral cooperation and the reality of how much has changed in China — and its obstinate refusal to let go of the comfort blanket of an outdated ideological perspective.  On Dec 16, Beijing time, 1978, China and the United States released a joint communiqué announcing they would establish diplomatic relations as of January 1, 1979.  It was the culmination of their diplomatic courtship that had caught the world by surprise when it was first revealed. Since then, the relationship has not only witnessed the rags-to-riches transformation of the most populous nation on Earth, it has also been in step with it.  Undoubtedly, the normalizing of their relations benefited not just China, but the US as well. But with Beijing and Washington now at loggerheads, it seems unlikely either will be offering to uncork the bubbly to celebrate this ruby anniversary.  Positioning China as a ""revisionist"" rival and the portrayal of it as ""predatory"" in the global market, in Africa in particular, shows that it is unfamiliarity that breeds contempt. China's image in US eyes has changed dramatically and Washington is acting on a false impression of it rather than the actuality.  Yet at a symposium to commemorate the 40 years of diplomatic relations in Shanghai, the organizers highlighted there were three consensuses reached between the Chinese and US participants.  These being: China and US interdependence can prevent the two countries from getting caught in the Thucydides' trap; the fundamentals of the bilateral relationship have not changed; and the US remains positive about the long-term opportunities in the Chinese market.  The impending escalation of their trade dispute in 72 days is preoccupying both governments at the moment, and risks locking them into that looming moment with increasing tunnel vision.  What is needed is a broader historical perspective that allows them to look back over the past 40 years of their relations, so they have a complete picture of the progress that has been made in their bilateral interaction and clearer view of how to push it forward in both their interests.  Forty years ago, the two countries recalibrated their perceptions of one another in the belief they had a shared future. It is time for them to do the same again.         "
No stopping reform or closing the door: China Daily editorial,12/17/2018,"                          The first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai. [Photo/VCG]   What China has achieved in the past four decades has vindicated the decision to initiate reform and opening-up. At the time, reform and opening-up were focused on how Chinese people's minds could be emancipated to embrace the notion of a market economy. Today, the domestic and international situations are very different from what they were 40 years ago, but the pursuit of further reform and opening-up still requires courage and resolve.  Domestically, what is urgently needed is not just to give people the green light to do whatever they were not allowed to do before, as was the practice in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, governments at all levels need to have a clear mind that reforms must promote a healthy business environment and build a strong domestic market.  They will have to bear these aims continually in mind, since the more specific a policy is the more difficult it will be to implement, as it will likely infringe upon some vested interests that have been formed over the past four decades. Oftentimes, local governments will have to give up their own vested interests or rack their brains to balance different interest groups.  And there is much that needs to be done. Not least promoting and coordinating regional development and pushing forward the rejuvenation strategy for rural areas, as well as speeding up reform of the economic system and pushing forward all-around opening-up.  For an important lesson China has learned over the past 40 years is the two must go hand-in-hand. By opening its door, China has succeeded in transforming a closed economy into one that embraces and benefits the world.  But that has also brought China new challenges and obstacles. Not least, because it has now moved nearer center stage in the international arena. As the world's second-largest economy whatever it does now has a bearing not only on itself but also on others. And its championing of multilateralism and fair trade has put it at odds with the rising trend of unilateralism and trade protectionism.  Whatever the circumstances, China will defend its national security and protect its own interests from being infringed upon. At the same time, it will use diplomacy to forge strong bonds with the rest of the world and resolve disputes.  The importance of opening up to the outside world can never be overestimated. That explains why President Xi Jinping has proposed to build a community with a shared future for mankind, in which win-win cooperation is promoted for the building of a better world. And that's why he remains confident that China will continue to comprehensively deepen reform and expand opening-up.         "
An important step forward in addressing climate change: China Daily editorial,12/16/2018,"                          People take part in the Claim the Climate march in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec 15, 2018, to demand action at the United Nations conference on climate change in Poland. [Photo/Agencies]   Just a week ago, the prospect of any agreement being reached at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was utterly unimaginable.  But what has been achieved in the Polish city of Katowice builds on what was agreed in Paris in 2015 and marks a significant step forward in efforts to address climate change.  When the big oil-exporting nations — the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait — blocked an endorsement of the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it looked like the conference was going to produce only more hot air.  The report concluded that while it is possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy and a shift away from fossil fuels.  That a rulebook was adopted on Saturday despite this setback is the result of resilient diplomacy and a triumph for multilateralism.  The rulebook sets out how countries should report their greenhouses gas emissions and the efforts they're taking to reduce them in a universal and transparent way. It also aims to ramp up the commitments made in Paris, with participating countries agreeing to update their carbon emission reduction goals by 2020. The new pledges will be reviewed at the UN summit to be held in September 2019.  There are also guidelines relating to the process for establishing new targets on financial assistance to support the efforts of developing countries from 2025 onwards as a follow-on to the current target of mobilizing $100 billion a year from 2020.  There is still a long way to go, but the outcome does offer hope that the grave consequences of not putting a brake on global warming are now evident to all and the urgency of doing so has been brought home.  A report by the World Meteorological Organization shows that the long-term trend for global warming remains unabated, with the 20 out of the last 22 years the warmest on record, with the last four years the warmest. Given the effects of global warming that have been witnessed so far, we cannot claim to have had no warnings of what lies in store if we fail to takes effective action.  Countries should stick to their ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and hold to their commitments for climate action. Any self-calculation will undercut global efforts in this regard.         "
Huawei focus for West's prejudicial view of China: China Daily editorial,12/16/2018,"                          A logo of Huawei Technologies. [Photo/IC]   A politically-motivated cloud is obviously gathering over China's private telecom technology giant Huawei. It was reported that the telecommunications company Orange has ruled out using Huawei products in its core 5G network in France and Germany's Deutsche Telecom says it's reviewing purchases of Huawei equipment.  Australia and New Zealand have already announced their decision to block Huawei from getting involved in the building of their 5G networks. While in the United Kingdom BT announced the week before last it was stripping Huawei equipment from its core 4G cellular network.  Given the repeated reports about Washington's pushing of its allies to shun Huawei equipment and technology, it is difficult not to view the detention of Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada early this month at the request of the United States as being politically motivated. It is therefore reasonable to believe the reports of a clandestine meeting by the ""Five Eyes"" countries to plan a way to strangle the development of Huawei.  National security is the excuse they use. Yet none of them have shown any evidence that Huawei's equipment or technology has deliberately been designed to place their national security at risk. There is also no solid evidence that Huawei is using its equipment or technology to gather intelligence for the Chinese government.  Washington would not consider Huawei as nail that must be hammered were the Chinese company not one of the technology leaders in the telecoms industry. Indeed, it probably wouldn't have noticed it, had Huawei not stood out as China has grown to be the world's second largest economy.  It is therefore not how Huawei has fared that is at issue, nor how China has developed. It is how Washington looks at China and Huawei that matters. To put it bluntly, it is Washington's fear that China may overtake the US to be the world's largest economy and a global technology leader in the near future that has alarmed Washington.  It should therefore go without saying that Huawei, a private company that is committed to the development of telecom and mobile communications technology and equipment, has been unfairly treated.  The political bias against Huawei among Western countries is undoubtedly detrimental to the overall development of the telecoms and mobile telecoms sector worldwide, as will not be able to concentrate the most advanced technology and equipment worldwide for its advancement of 5G networks.  We can hardly expect much of what is in store for the development of the world economy and globalization unless the US and its allies change their mentality.         "
Politicized law enforcement Washington's predilection: China Daily editorial,12/13/2018,"                          Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou exits the court registry following the bail hearing at British Columbia Superior Courts in Vancouver on Dec 11, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   When US State Department spokesman Robert Palladino remarked that the US condemns ""all forms of arbitrary detention"" on Tuesday, he was commenting on reports that two Canadians have been detained in China.  It would have been welcome and proper if that remark had applied to the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by the Canadian authorities at Washington’s request. However, it seems the condemnation Palladino conveyed was directed solely at Beijing.  His words were more revealing of how Washington operates rather than Beijing. Washington naturally assumes the compulsory measures Beijing has taken are politically motivated — an expedient move on Beijing’s part to retaliate against Ottawa — since that is how it operates.  While the timing may have led others to draw the same conclusion, Ottawa has found no indication of any such link, and Beijing has not expressed any cause-and-effect connections. Instead, it has clarified that the two Canadian nationals are being questioned about illegal activities that may threaten national security.  To suggest that Beijing, indignant at the arbitrary detention of a Chinese citizen, may now be embarking on some kind of arbitrary detention spree, locking up visiting Canadians or Americans willy-nilly, merely shows how removed from reality Washington is — or perhaps how intent it is on trying to persuade companies to invest elsewhere.  That this is the impression Washington wants to create is reinforced by reports that it is considering issuing a warning to US citizens, including executives, traveling to China, suggesting they are at risk of being used in retaliation for the detention of Meng.  Interpreting the two detentions in this way represents a serious misreading of the matter, as well as that of China as a country — portraying, as it does, a stubborn, biased picture of China as a country that remains in a state of lawlessness.  Actually, it is Washington’s abusive and politicized use of long-arm jurisdiction — which it claims is simply domestic law enforcement — that has triggered concerns over the travel safety among business people. And Chinese people are also weighing how safe it is for them to visit Canada.  For its need of and commitment to greater openness, China cannot afford the image of having no respect for the rule of law. No innocent foreign nationals, wherever they are from, should fear for their safety visiting or living in China. It seems the same cannot be said of foreign nationals stepping onto Canadian soil, even if they are only changing planes.         "
Pompeo's Marriott hacking claim simply preposterous: China Daily editorial,12/13/2018,"                      Give a dog a bad name and hang it. That is exactly what the United States was trying to do when it pointed an accusing finger at China on Wednesday, claiming that the country was behind the massive hacking of data from hotel giant Marriott, involving some 500 million of its customers. Yet instead of concrete and credible evidence, such a serious accusation has so far been based on nothing other than ""we believe"" and ""we suspect"" — perfunctory assumptions — as made when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Fox News program that Washington believes China masterminded the Marriott data theft, and when officials from the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security told the Senate Committee on the Judiciary that China is working to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from US companies in order to harm its economy. An investigation is now under way into the Marriott data theft, but given how arduous and complicated it could be — since the hacking is known to date back to 2014 at least — such presumption of guilt can only be politically motivated. Since Pompeo's allegation came amid rising tensions between the two countries over trade frictions, people can't help but wonder whether the US is up to its tricks again as it seeks to gain an upper hand in the deadlined negotiations aimed at reaching a deal with China. The unfounded accusation is especially disappointing and worrisome since both countries had previously reached a consensus that they would not knowingly support the cyber theft of corporate secrets or business information, paving the way for concerted efforts to tackle cybercrimes. There were doubts at the time about whether that agreement would have any practical effect on the behavior of the US, and those doubts would appear to have been justified by Pompeo's remarks. Rather than trying to claim China stole the horse, the US should first fix the stable door. One of the largest ransomware attacks, which was staged in May last year, used one of the hacking tools that the US National Security Agency created for its own use. That an agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks was itself so vulnerable to hackers shows how serious the problem is. China, as a major target of serious international cyberattacks, has always advocated international cooperation to safeguard cybersecurity. The internet is so pervasive in modern life that only combined efforts can ensure effective protection for all the inhabitants of cyberspace.         "
Canada should choose right course and not play US game: China Daily editorial,12/12/2018,"                          Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. [Photo/IC]   A Canadian court granted bail to Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on Tuesday, which is a step in the right direction. But it is only a small one, and the diplomatic incident, which has been manufactured by Washington using Ottawa as a tool to manipulate the extradition system for political not legal ends, is still far from over.  There are strict conditions for Meng's release, but Canada said that so far the United States has not formally requested her extradition. If the US does not formally request it within 60 days from the date of her detention, Meng will be released.  Considering that Beijing and Washington are in the process of restarting a fresh round of negotiations aimed at bringing an end to trade frictions between them, the timing of Meng's detention and whether or not the US will pursue her extradition has sparked a lot of speculation.  The conjecture that her detention is a bargaining chip in the 90-day-deadlined trade negotiations between the US and China was seemingly given substance by the remarks of US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, when in an interview with Reuters, he said he would intervene in the case if it would help seal a trade deal with China.  It goes without saying that the Chinese government will keep a close watch on Meng's case and will do whatever it takes to ensure she gets a fair hearing, but Washington is mistaken if it thinks it can take Meng hostage and ransom her for concessions in the upcoming trade talks.  Likewise Canada is mistaken if it believes that a former diplomat's detention is linked to Meng's arrest. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang commenting on Meng's bail on Wednesday made it clear that Michael Kovrig has been detained for questioning about possible illegal activities in China relating to his work with an NGO, which being unregistered means he and the NGO have violated the law.  Instead of complicating Meng's detention by trying to link it to other issues, Canada and the US should show political wisdom and untangle the various issues so that they can be resolved in the correct way.  Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said that Kovrig's detention has attention at the very highest level of government, which is all well and good. But the highest attention should also be given to Ottawa's actions in the service of Washington. Canada's willingness to play ball with the US in the games it is playing with China has badly damaged its image among Chinese people and will only gravely harm bilateral relations.  As Lu said, Meng's detention was a mistake from the start and China's request is very clear — Canada should immediately release Meng and protect her legitimate rights and interests.         "
UK's Brexit frolics only aggravate global gloom: China Daily editorial,12/11/2018,"                          British Prime Minister Theresa May returns to Downing street after postponing a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal in London on Dec 10, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   It has been generally concluded that British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a parliamentary vote on Brexit scheduled for Tuesday as she anticipated a crushing defeat.  Up until then, the embattled May had steadfastly held on to the line that it was either her deal or no deal for the United Kingdom's petulant parting from the European Union. She categorically ruled out any other options.  As did Brussels.  European Council President Donald Tusk made clear there was no possibility of reopening negotiations ahead of the planned vote, when he tweeted on Monday that the EU would not renegotiate the deal.  Now that May has bowed to reason and accepted that her deal was already dead in the water since there was no possibility of it gaining a parliamentary seal of approval, she is desperately trying to get additional concessions from the EU ahead of a vote that is now penciled in for some time in January. Although it seems her mission will be in vain, as the message she will hear is expected to remain the same — she got the best and only deal on offer.  Without tangible concessions from Brussels, delaying the vote is just delaying the inevitable. And even if the EU was willing to renegotiate, there is no way that a deal can be found that will appease everyone.  Meanwhile, to compound what is already a somewhat bizarre mess of the UK's own making, the European Court of Justice ruled on Monday that the UK can pretend the whole thing was just a bad dream as it can stop the article 50 process without seeking the EU's approval.  Really, you couldn't make it up. If it wasn't for the fact that the repercussions are so serious — and not just for the UK — it would be viewed as a comedy of errors.  Yet here we are. And whatever happens next there will be shock waves. Not just in terms of the economic consequences of whatever unfolds, but also in terms of the social tensions that Brexit has helped to expose in both the UK and the EU. These will only be aggravated, come what may.  Whether Brexit is hard or soft, or even if it never happens, there are going to be a lot of pieces that will need to be picked up as quickly as possible to restore a sense of stability and restore confidence in the validity and meaning of the UK and EU institutions.

40 years of diplomatic ties should not be squandered: China Daily editorial,12/11/2018,"                      On Jan 1, 1979, China and the United States issued their joint communiqué establishing diplomatic relations. Since then the general trend has been for their ties to be strengthened.  There have been dips, of course; some deeper than others. Given their different social systems, cultures and development stages, it would be a marriage made in heaven if there were no misunderstandings, affronts or quarrels.  But over the past 40 years, they have got to know one another better and found ways to put their disagreements behind them. While it is imaginable that China and the US could sever all their ties, it is doubtful either side really wants to, despite appearances.  Which is why both sides have exchanged views on pushing forward the timetable and road map for the next stage of their trade consultations, with a view to ending their current spat.  Vice-Premier Liu He spoke with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer by telephone on Tuesday morning Beijing time to put flesh on the bones of the consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Argentina at the beginning of the month.  Both leaders agreed then that bilateral relations should develop in a coordinated, cooperative and steady manner. Their discarding of the zero-sum mentality that can plague international relations laid the foundation for the efforts to push ties away from unnecessary confrontation.  It is understandable that China wants to defend the multilateral trading system, without which China would not have achieved what it has. It should also be understandable that China will adhere to socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has been the guarantee for China's development.  It is also important that US politicians look at the reality of China rather than slotting it into a pigeonhole from the past.  Likewise, it is understandable that the US does not want to give up that to which it has become accustomed.  Both countries should have learned enough lessons from the ups and downs of their relations over the past four decades to know that both benefit from cooperation and suffer from confrontation. There are no winners if China and the US are antagonistic, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a forum on Tuesday.  Perhaps over its festive season, those in Washington with an axe to grind against China can take time to reflect impartially on the changes that have taken place in the world over the past 40 years.  It would be good if the New Year were to herald an upturn in relations and even brighter prospects for the future as the two sides build on their leaders' consensus.         "
IPCC's call for action should be welcomed: China Daily editorial,12/10/2018,"                      The 2018 United Nations climate change conference, now in session in Katowice, Poland, had to take an unplanned day off on Sunday, because the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked the endorsement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report on what would happen if the average global temperatures rise by 1.5 degrees, and how to ensure they don't. Three years back in Paris, when countries agreed on the need for joint actions to contain global warming, they called for such a scientific report on what needed to be done. That report is now in, and the four countries didn't like the implications. The US State Department said the US noted the IPCC report but did not ""welcome"" it, as to do so would be to endorse it. Which is basically saying we can all go to hell in a fossil-fueled handcart, because not even Mother Nature gets to tell this administration what to do. The statement sends a stark message of how difficult it is to get everyone to appreciate that climate change is happening and lifestyle changes are unavoidable, not optional, if runaway global warming is to be prevented. The current US administration's infamous distrust of the scientific findings about climate change means its casual dismissal of the report comes as no real surprise. But while negotiations in the rest of the week are expected to get a lot tougher than previously anticipated, that would be nothing compared with the critical summit ending up without a meaningful consensus on what to do next. Nonparticipation by a few countries may not stop concerned members of the international community from pressing ahead with their own climate response agenda under the framework of the Paris Agreement. Key supporters including China and the European Union have repeatedly stated their respective commitment to what has been agreed upon, and there is a shared sense of urgency about reworking and upgrading growth models and promoting clean energy usage, an urgency that will only become more acute as the reality of the global temperature rise begins to bite. But climate change is a problem way beyond any individual country's capacities. Collective, indeed universal, actions are indispensable if a difference is to be made globally. If this year's UN climate summit fails to achieve a consensus on actions to be taken, much of what countries agreed in Paris risks becoming empty talk. Because according to that agreement, 2018 is the deadline for plans honoring emissions reduction commitments.         "
Ottawa willing dupe for Washington's power play: China Daily editorial,12/10/2018,"                          Huawei Technologies executive director Meng Wanzhou. [Photo/IC]   China is justified in reacting indignantly to the indignities imposed on Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen who was detained by the Canadian authorities at the behest of the US Justice Department while she was in transit between flights in Vancouver on Dec 1.  Like any other country in the world, it has an obligation to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens. Hence, the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Canadian Ambassador to China John McCallum on Saturday and United States Ambassador to China Terry Branstad on Sunday to express its strong protests at Meng's detention and demand the reasons for her detention, as no justification had been given.  Having an extradition treaty with the US, Ottawa might feel it is caught in the middle of the conflict between Washington and Beijing, but to be frank that is the position it has chosen to put itself in. Since by detaining Huawei's chief financial officer, Ottawa is not upholding the law but instead letting itself be used as a tool of US law enforcement, which is itself being politicized to achieve Washington's policy objective of weakening China's corporate competitiveness.  The US is not only trying to tarnish the image of one of China's most successful companies overseas — along with its Belt and Road Initiative and overseas investments — it is also using its unilateral sanctions against Iran and the extended reach of extraterritoriality to stretch the arm of its law to try and fatally damage the competitiveness of one of China's technology leaders. This is hijacking the extradition system for its political aims.  Ties between Canada and China were in their best shape for years before Meng's detention. Last month, the two sides held the first economic and financial strategic dialogue, vowing to deepen cooperation and press ahead with negotiations on a free trade agreement. But the move by Ottawa has revealed its true colors and Beijing will now need to consider what is its best course of action.  Meng's detention has also added more pressure on China-US ties, which seemed to be on a positive trajectory after having fallen to their lowest point in years thanks to the US-instigated trade frictions. With this in mind, US politicians should refrain from fanning the flames of the current incident by making inflammatory remarks.  In this regard, US Senator Marco Rubio's remarks on Sunday were most inappropriate. When asked on a CBS program about his reaction to Meng's detention, Rubio said he wanted to reintroduce legislation that would ban Huawei and its fellow Chinese telecom companies from doing business in the US.  The US politician's presumption of guilt in Meng's case was appalling and revealing as not only does it not conform to human rights values touted by Rubio's own country, it also laid bare the political motivation behind her detention, which runs counter to the spirit of the law.

Anti-graft momentum must not abate for clean governance: China Daily editorial,12/9/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   China has enough reason to take pride in what it has achieved in its fight against corruption on the 15th International Anti-Corruption Day which fell on Sunday. The country is not only well on the way of building a mechanism to place power in the cage of law. It has also achieved a great deal in its cooperation with other countries in tracking down economic criminal suspects that have fled overseas.  A total of 171 ministerial level or above officials have been indicted or investigated for abuse of power since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. More than 20 of them have been apprehended in a little more than a year since the 19th National Congress of the CPC in October 2017.  What the anti-graft fight has achieved and its unabated momentum speaks volumes for the resolve of the Party leadership to rid the Party and government of all bad apples and finally create a political and legal environment which leaves no room for abuse of power.  No corrupt elements should harbor a try-my-luck mentality in the belief that they will somehow be able to get away with any abuse of power.  Through close cooperation with an increasing number of countries, China has repatriated 4,833 economic criminal suspects from 125 countries to face trial since it launched its Skynet operations in April 2015 to hunt down such corrupt elements who have fled overseas. And these efforts will only be strengthened with China’s International Criminal Justice Assistance Law taking effect in October.  It is of vital importance to make it impossible for corrupt elements to seek a hiding place overseas, as closing this last line of retreat would shatter the notion some officials harbor that they will be able to enjoy their ill-gotten gains overseas.  Corruption is perniciously harmful to healthy economic growth, undermines the country's efforts to eliminate poverty and helps facilitate organized crimes. But corruption is not just a challenge to China, it is a global one.  With unremitting efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, China will be able to not only intensify its fight against corruption at home, but also play its part in the global anti-graft fight through law-enforcement collaboration and information exchanges.

Canada should not let US dictate its politics: China Daily editorial,12/9/2018,"                          Huawei Technologies executive director Wanzhou Meng. [Photo/IC]   Vancouver said earlier that it would not ""let politics slip into decisions"" when Canada refused to join the other four ""Five Eyes"" — Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States — in banning China's Huawei Technologies from participating in the 5G mobile networks in their countries.  Unfortunately, that is what it is now doing.  The country has surrendered to the United States' ugly politics by detaining Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's global chief financial officer, on Dec 1 when she was transferring at Vancouver airport. An action done at the request of the US judicial authorities, which claim Huawei violated the sanctions the US has imposed on Iran.  Huawei has stated that it complies with all laws and rules where it operates, including the export controls and sanctions of the United Nations, the US and European Union, and no details have been forthcoming relating to the alleged charges.  Detaining a Chinese citizen during her change of flight without giving any concrete reason is severely violating her legitimate rights and interests. And Canada has treated Meng as a dangerous criminal, handcuffing her at the airport and making her wear ankle restraints after her first bail hearing.  Meng is a middle-aged woman, who has health issues and is still in recovery from neck surgery in May, yet she is being treated as a violent offender. It is hard to escape the conclusion that her treatment is something of a show trial intended to humiliate her and China.  On Saturday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Le Yucheng summoned the Canadian Ambassador to China John McCallum to lodge solemn representations and strong protests at the arrest, and urging her to release Meng immediately and earnestly protect her legal and legitimate rights and interests or face grave consequences.  According to the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ottawa had advance notice of the arrest. However, he chose not to keep the Chinese side informed but connived in the US' action against Huawei.  Huawei has become something of a bête noire for the US administration. The Chinese company, which is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies, has been looking to position itself at the forefront of the nascent 5G revolution that is beginning to take shape and the US administration wants to reserve that spot for US companies.  To this end, the US has been pressuring the other ""Five Eyes"" to limit the use of Huawei technology. But the latest move targeting Huawei is nasty. It is to be hoped that Canada will not simply hold a candle while the devil does its dirty deeds. It risks resulting in serious consequences and Canada will have to bear the responsibility.         "
Containing Huawei's expansion detrimental to China-US ties,12/6/2018,"                          For better China-US relations and bright prospects for the world economy as well as the good performance of its own economy, the US needs to change its mentality toward China. [Photo/VCG]   There is still no telling on what grounds Huawei's global chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Canada, although she is reportedly facing extradition to the United States as it alleges she was trying to evade US curbs on trade with Iran. But one thing that is undoubtedly true and proven is the US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei's expansion in the world simply because the company is the point man for China's competitive technology companies.  As one of the largest makers of telecommunications network equipment, it is natural for Huawei to cooperate with telecom companies all over the world and for it to want to be involved in the construction of 4G and 5G cellular networks.  However, Washington has asked its allies to cut ties with Huawei, claiming its equipment poses strong cyber security risks.  Such pressure from the US has made it very difficult for some governments and companies to make a decision on their cooperation with Huawei, whose provision of mobile equipment and services can make a positive contribution to their telecommunications network.  In the latest submission, Britain's largest mobile provider BT revealed on Wednesday it was stripping the equipment of Huawei from its core 4G cellular network after similar moves by the US and New Zealand. Australia announced in August that it will ban Huawei from its 5G network.  Security concerns are the reason given, but no evidence of this has been forthcoming while the pressure from the US is writ large. What propels Washington's animosity against China is its pertinacious Cold War mentality, with which it continually distorts the reality of international relations.  What is badly needed for the development of China-US ties is political trust. Yet Washington, in persuading and pressuring its allies to shun cooperation with Huawei, has helped erode that political trust.  For better China-US relations and bright prospects for the world economy as well as the good performance of its own economy, the US needs to change its mentality toward China.  President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump had a meeting on Saturday that was seen as bringing China-US trade relations onto the right track of resolving their differences through talks.  Rather than clinging to the familiarity of an outdated adversarial approach to what it considers a ""rival"", Washington should explore ways to put meat on the bones of the White House's observation after Saturday's meeting that friendly relations offer ""unlimited possibilities"".  China and the US are at a critical point in their relations, the US should not let bad habits hinder their efforts to build on the positive momentum that emerged from the meeting.         "
Washington real saboteur of multinational system: China Daily editorial,12/6/2018,"                          US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [Photo/IC]   Unpersuasive as they were to both allies and non-allies alike, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's China-related remarks in Brussels endeavored to inject some coherence into Washington's erratic foreign policy.  His remarks in a speech at the German Marshall Fund on Tuesday offer valuable insights into the White House's outlook on the present-day world.  As a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry pointed out, Pompeo's identifying China as a ""bad actor"" sounded incoherent with the shared interest the Chinese and US leaders displayed in ironing out divergences. Let alone the near impossibility of rebuilding a world order excluding China, Russia and Iran, if not others.  Pompeo's address might sound laughable to some as Washington seemingly wants to isolate Beijing while it is constantly estranging itself from otherwise close allies and partners. Even as he tried to reassure US allies of Washington's credibility as a trustworthy partner, Pompeo again disparaged multilateral international institutions, from the United Nations to the European Union.  His accusations against China, from it allegedly taking advantage of loopholes in the World Trade Organization rules to ""undermining"" the international order, have been heard before and were made on the same shaky grounds. Beijing has come up with forceful and valid retorts, backed up with the evidence that it has faithfully honored its WTO obligations, and is an adamant defender of multilateralism as well as the post-war international order — both of which the Trump White House seems intent on sabotaging.  What Washington has done and is doing to the international order, as well as to Beijing, is there for everyone to see.  But the words Pompeo uttered in Brussels do mean something. When it comes to Washington's perception of China, Pompeo's statements share the same thread running through the US National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy reports and US Vice-President Mike Pence's earlier speech berating China.  They do not appear in official agreements. They may even contradict White House announcements. Even the US president's tweets. But they do mean things. They point to an unspoken turn in US foreign policy thinking featuring unprecedented vigilance against China. A shift that will have lasting impacts on the US' China policy and China-US relations.  If Washington does manage to portray Beijing as bending or rewriting international rules against US and Western interests, and hence attempt to ""rebuild"" an international order that seeks to exclude China, a standoff will be difficult to avoid.

China willing to try and help US overcome its opioid crisis: China Daily editorial,12/5/2018,"                      There is enough reason to welcome the consensus President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump reached on the control of fentanyl in their meeting in Argentina over the weekend. But it would be totally wrong to conclude from the agreement that China is to blame for the abuse of opioids in the United States. Fentanyl is said to be 100 times more powerful than morphine, and even 30-50 times more potent than heroin, and its abuse has become a serious social problem in the US. More than 72,000 people died of drug overdoses in the US last year, with fentanyl responsible for more than 29,000 of them, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On the one hand, with the increasingly widening gap between the haves and have-nots in the US, an increasing number of poor people turn to opioids, including synthetic ones, to escape the harsh reality of their lives. On the other hand, the abuse of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has a lot to do with some US pharmaceutical companies, which manufacture and sell fentanyl-containing drugs as painkillers. As a result, many people get addicted to such prescription opioids and some die from an overdose. China has long exerted strict control over the production and sale of fentanyl substances. While there is no knowing whether there are any criminal gangs manufacturing fentanyl substances and smuggling them into the US, there are only five licensed pharmaceutical companies that manufacture fentanyl substances and related preparations. Their total output was 24.26 kilograms in 2017, none of which has been found to have fallen into illegal channels. All told, China has already put 25 variants of fentanyl, plus two precursor chemicals used to make the drug on its list of controlled substances. Now, the Foreign Ministry says that all fentanyl-like substances will be listed as controlled substances as the government starts working to adjust related regulations. This will prevent any chemical variants of fentanyl being produced faster than regulators can declare them illegal. The authorities will also further tighten their control on the manufacturing and sale of fentanyl substances and strengthen their efforts to prevent any illegal manufacturing and smuggling. But it is imperative the US do what it can to fight its opioid crisis, instead of just passing the buck to China.         "
Washington should rethink treaty withdrawal threat: China Daily editorial,12/5/2018,"                          Russia's President Vladimir Putin, left, watches President Donald Trump, right, walk past him as they gather for the group photo at the start of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Friday, Nov 30, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The United States set a deadline of 60 days for Russia to comply with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on Tuesday, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issuing a warning at NATO talks in Brussels that Washington would activate a six-month notice period for leaving the pact unless Russia ""returns to full and verifiable compliance"".  After US President Donald Trump threatened the US withdrawal from the INF deal in October, the latest US ultimatum shows Washington is still eager to exert more strategic pressure on Moscow.  Washington has repeatedly accused Moscow of being in violation and noncompliance of the INF Treaty, while Moscow has always denied the accusations.  Considering that the INF Treaty has been a cornerstone of maintaining strategic equilibrium between the US and Russia, a unilateral withdrawal by the US would no doubt deepen confrontation with Russia and would likely usher in a new Cold War.  Under the backdrop of escalated tensions between Russia and Ukraine over the Sea of Azov, the prospect of the US leaving the INF pact would also deal a heavy blow to the security outlook of Europe, making it the frontline for the confrontation between the US and Russia.  The US' latest decision is another manifestation of its unilateralist tendencies under the current administration. In May, the Donald Trump administration announced its decision to withdraw from another key nuclear agreement — the Iranian nuclear pact, leaving the multilateral deal in tatters and exacerbating tensions between Teheran and Washington.  By back-pedaling on one nuclear treaty after another, the US aims to give itself carte blanche to upgrade its own nuclear arsenal. Such ambitions were clearly stated in the nuclear posture review revealed by the Trump administration in February.  Ironically, while Washington is pulling out of nuclear weapons control deals, it is pushing for an unprecedented reconciliation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the aim of getting that country to abandon its nuclear defenses.  The US decision to withdraw from both the INF Treaty and the Iran deal is unlikely to instill confidence in Pyongyang that Washington will honor any agreement.  In today's world of interdependency and inter-reliance, the US should know that any decision that may imperil other countries' security outlook will backfire and undermine its own security.  Washington should realize that too much would be at stake if the 1987 pact is abandoned: It would undercut the international efforts at nuclear non-proliferation and trigger a worldwide nuclear arms race, thus worsening the nuclear security of all countries, including the US.

Belt and Road a vehicle to realize common growth: China Daily editorial,12/4/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping (L) holds talks with his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela in Panama City, Panama, on Dec 3, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   From Madrid to Buenos Aires to Panama City to Lisbon, as he has done on nearly every other stop on his recent overseas trips, President Xi Jinping has tirelessly promoted the building of a community of shared future for mankind, and the Belt and Road Initiative as a means to achieve that.  Inspired by and modeled on the ancient Silk Road, the Beijing-proposed initiative is meant to bring countries together again via infrastructure and trade links. For Beijing, it is not only an antidote to the rising tide against globalization, but also a means to create a community of shared interests and responsibilities.  But not everyone sees it that way. While some countries have been quick to see the positive potentials of the Belt and Road and how they can benefit from it, there are some who insist on viewing it more warily.  Accompanying Xi on each of his stops, there have been the usual suspicions from some quarters about the motives behind the Belt and Road. Although the mysterious threat they speak of is one that they seem unable to pin down.  To some of them, it is a generic and vague assumption that investments from China are potential ""debt traps"" that call for extreme vigilance. Or else ""threats to national security"", which is why what would be mutually beneficial business mergers involving Chinese enterprises have hit the rocks. The Chinese telecommunications technology giant Huawei, for instance, has found the doors to the 5G telecommunications markets of advanced countries closed to it on ""national security"" grounds. Likewise, the European Union has agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly those from China, on the same premise.  Even as Chinese and Portuguese leaders discuss bilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road, there is no lack of concern about ""China's influence"".  But existing EU rules do not prohibit Lisbon from seeking such a partnership. If Lisbon sees no harm from foreign investment, no outsider is in a position to prevent it from making a choice that is in its own best interests.  Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa has reminded EU decision-makers of his country's desire for foreign investment, and advised the latter to avoid taking ""the path of protectionism"".  It was a timely and apt reminder.  Xi's trip, as he wrote in a signed article published in the Portuguese media, has taken him across the Eurasian continent to destinations in Europe and across the Atlantic Ocean to Latin America, and what has impressed him most have been the ardent aspirations of people around the world for peace, tranquility, development, progress and a happier life.  In the face of the difficulties and challenges in today's world, China and the countries that have embraced the Belt and Road are convinced it is the way to common development and lasting peace and stability in the world.

Climate change leaves us no time for talking without action: China Daily editorial,12/3/2018,"                          Delegates attend the opening of UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland Dec 3, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   What can we expect of the United Nations Climate Change Conference that opened in Katowice, Poland, on Monday?  We sincerely hope that it will no longer serve up just a diet of rhetoric and instead produce a down-to-earth action plan in which all countries do their bit.  But that requires the major countries to demonstrate the political will to agree on ways to implement the promises they made in the 2015 Paris treaty to limit temperature rises to avert runaway global warming.  A UN report revealed last week that the goal to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will hardly be attained as the amount of carbon dioxide emitted worldwide in 2017 had actually increased rather than decreased. Another report by the World Meteorological Organization said that the past four years have been the warmest on record and warned that the global temperatures could easily rise by 4-5 C by 2100.  The only solace we've got is that the just concluded G20 summit at the weekend reiterated the commitment of 19 of the major economies to the fight against climate change — the odd one out being the United States, whose current administration seems to perversely view global warming as simply a vagary of nature, and reiterated its withdrawal from the climate accord to which most other countries have now signed up.  China is a strong advocate for joint efforts by the international community to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted in China in 2017 declined by 46 percent compared with that in 2015, according to a report on China's policies and actions to fight against climate change, demonstrating that China is acting to fulfill its promise to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and will spare no efforts in making it happen earlier.  It hopes that a mechanism will be established to guarantee that the Paris Agreement will be implemented to the letter, and the Talanoa Dialogue will continue to take stock of what all major signatory countries have done and will do by 2020.  Those developed countries in particular are expected to show their political will and help their developing counterparts with both funds and technologies to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide.  The clock is ticking on a climate bomb whose chain reaction and fallout should it go off would have catastrophic consequences for all life on Earth. There is still time to defuse it, but not much. There is no time left for talking, what is needed is action — from everyone.         "
Latin America benefits from dividends of Belt and Road,12/3/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping (L) meets with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Dec 2, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   President Xi Jinping's official visits to Argentina and Panama, following his attendance at the just concluded G20 Leaders' Summit in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on the weekend, will turn a new page in China's relations with these two countries and help further enhance reciprocal cooperation between China and Latin America.  In his meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri on Sunday, the two leaders agreed to jointly open up a new era for the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. They also vowed to continue cooperation on various infrastructure projects, energy and agriculture while promoting collaboration in such fields as culture, education, tourism and environmental protection.  Both China and Argentina are major developing countries and emerging-market economies, and both are staunch supporters of multilateralism and an open and inclusive global economy. Their pledge to foster even closer bilateral ties will cater to the interests of both countries and offer support to the global economic system as well as contribute to China's relationship with Latin America.  As for Xi's visit to Panama this week, the first by a Chinese president, its significance goes beyond the bilateral scope as Panama — a country with strategic importance in international shipping and trade, which only established formal diplomatic ties with China last year — has been the first Latin American country to sign a memorandum of understanding with China to promote the Belt and Road Initiative.  The past one and half years have witnessed a strong momentum in bilateral cooperation featuring both efficiency and initial achievements, and the rosy picture for bilateral ties shows the strong appeal of China to Latin American countries      President Xi Jinping (2nd L Front), his wife Peng Liyuan (1st L Front), Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela (2nd R Front) and his wife Lorena Castillo Garcia (1st R Front) attend a grand welcoming ceremony Juan Carlos Varela held for Xi Jinping in Panama City Dec 2, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   It is not only the desire to tap the vast potential of the Chinese market but also the recognition that China's development dividends can be shared.  Xi left for Argentina after visiting Spain and he will return to China after visiting Portugal, highlighting the historical ties between the Old World and New World and how the revival of the ancient Silk Road trade routes which now link China to Europe and to Latin America.  True, Latin America is a sensitive region in geopolitics. But China has no intention of seeking a sphere of influence there. Attempts to malign China's cooperation with countries is at best ignorant or worst ill-intentioned.  China is not engaged in a zero-sum game in the region. It is working with Latin American countries to build logistics, electricity and information pathways. This is not as a means to pursue geopolitical competition, but rather as a way to realize shared growth.  For despite the current challenges facing Latin America, China is confident the growth prospects for the region are bright, and it will continue to work with partners in the region, including Argentina and Panama, for shared development.

With sincerity US can build on consensus with China,12/3/2018,"                          [Photo/IC]   No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight. But the highly anticipated talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump over dinner in Buenos Aires on Saturday have produced a welcome consensus that the two sides will work on ways to resolve their differences: Most pressingly their trade dispute, which had been threatening to deteriorate into a full-on trade war with the prospect of additional tariffs looming on Jan 1.  The fact that the two leaders could sit down for candid talks and agree to avoid the looming escalation of trade tariffs to allow for continuing trade negotiations, shows that both sides are aware of how damaging they would be, not just to each other but the global economy as a whole.  But given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track.  The vicissitudes of bilateral trade and economic relations in the past months have shown that in brooding over China's growing status in the international community, there are some in Washington who have let their concerns run away with their imaginations.  Therefore, the positive and constructive consensus reached on Saturday between the two leaders will be even more significant if it has helped to clear the air and created some breathing space for more rational thinking that can harness their competition for the common good.  China has said that it will work to resolve the US rational concerns-and it has backed up its words with actions by agreeing to expand US imports-but a lasting improvement in bilateral relations is still dependent on the sincerity of the US to engage in equal-footed consultations with China, bearing in mind the reality of China's situation.  That being said, by ending the immediate prospect of an escalation of their trade frictions, they have shown that both are willing to listen to each other and are committed to serious dialogue.

Declaration shows G20 still embrace spirit of partnership: China Daily editorial,12/2/2018,"                          A plane flies above the Costa Salguero Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Nov 27, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   It is not easy for the leaders of different countries to reach a unanimous agreement on issues such as trade and climate change. The just concluded G20 Leaders Summit in Buenos Aires reached a consensus on promoting ""fair and sustainable development through an agenda that is people-centered, inclusive and forward-looking"". It can therefore be considered an achievement in itself.  True, that will still require teams from the 20 major economies to sit down together to hammer out the details of how they will work together for a fair and free trading mechanism within the multilateral trading framework. But at least they should be starting on the same page and be clear about what they are aiming for.  And that is exactly what these summits are supposed to do - set a common direction and put shoulders to the wheel of the cart of common endeavors and set it rolling in the right direction.  Thus it was important for the leaders of the major economies to agree that the world economy will not fully recover unless international trade and investment play their proper roles in promoting growth, productivity and innovation.  The declaration from the summit shows that the G20 leaders are committed to ""promoting dialogue and the search for common ground"", showing they are as aware as anyone our world needs solidarity and collaborative efforts.  As President Xi Jinping accentuated in Argentina, Beijing is dedicated to building strong partnerships, which are a critical cornerstone of the country's desired relationship with the rest of the world. They are part of China's efforts to forge a global community at a time when the world is undergoing profound changes and facing unprecedented challenges that require a concerted response.  The recent APEC meeting was notable for the spoiling efforts of the United States, with US Vice-President Mike Pence striking a divisive note that was at odds with the solidarity of purpose shown by the other participants.  The G20 meeting was more realistic - and pragmatic - with the leaders showing they are willing to shelve differences to engage in constructive dialogue.  If they continue to do so, they should be able to avert any damaging scenario that will inevitably leave the world in turmoil.         "

Still a tough battle to win fight against HIV: China Daily editorial,11/29/2018,"                      Thirty years after the first World AIDS Day was marked on Dec 1, 1988, HIV remains one of the world's major infectious killers.  Worldwide more than 77 million people are infected with the virus, and more than 35 million have died of AIDS-related diseases so far, according to the United Nations.  In China, 1.25 million people — or about 9 in every 10,000 people — are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  Although this is a low rate compared with many other countries, there are about 80,000 newly infected people in the country every year, and that number is expected to continue to rise in the future.  An increasingly open attitude toward sex, a huge migrant population and rapid development of the internet and the proliferation of dating apps have combined to make the task of fighting HIV/AIDS in China ever more arduous. There is also a growing trend for the virus to spread beyond the high-risk group of sex workers, drug users and gay men.  Adding to the challenge is the low sense of awareness about the deadly virus. Less than 40 percent of sexually active high school and college students in China have ever used a condom, which has contributed to a steady rise in infections — from less than 800 a year in 2008 to more than 3,000 a year now — among this social group, according to a survey. Infections among people aged 60 years or above, who generally don't have much knowledge about HIV/AIDS, have also risen markedly, the CDC said.  All this means the government — which is trying to raise awareness of the disease, and improve safe sex education, and provide those in need with greater access to testing, treatment and preventive drugs — is still fighting an uphill battle to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal of bringing the AIDS epidemic under control by 2030.  So far the Chinese government has shown to the world it is not mission impossible, as proved by its success in preventing the spread of HIV through blood transfusions — with nearly zero cases of infection through this channel recorded.  As the UNAIDS chief said last year, the Chinese authorities have prevented a public health threat by acting fast and decisively, but to make further progress not only must the government continue to strengthen its efforts, each and every one of us has a role to play as well in preventing the spread of the virus.

Positive hopes for meeting if everyone is reasonable: China Daily editorial,11/29/2018,"                      Although no one can tell whether or not the widely anticipated meeting between the Chinese and United States leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit will de-escalate the ongoing trade conflict, there can be little doubt that whatever the outcome is, it will have far-reaching consequences.  Both Beijing and Washington know that. But to avert the less than desirable scenarios that have been talked about, both parties will have to be sensitive to each other's sensibilities. No party should count on the other side to do all the giving without getting anything in return.  Beijing wants a deal, just as Washington does. And it is willing to cooperate with Washington in dealing with concerns about trade if they are fair-minded. That should suffice for a mutually acceptable solution to be found to their present dispute if it is about trade. Should there be any other aspirations, such as taking advantage of the trade spat to throttle Chinese growth, then an agreement is unlikely to be reached.  And there's the rub, for the US seems intent on sharpening its competitive edge in technology by whatever means necessary.  The White House appears optimistic about taking home a good deal from Buenos Aires based on the belief the US economy is in better shape to weather a long trade war than China's, and it seems to be counting on this to squeeze concessions from China.  But a good deal means both sides walking away happy. The US should give its habitual winner-take-all approach to international relations the weekend off.  Despite hopes for ""positive results"" of the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, that is by no means guaranteed, and should they not be forthcoming and additional tariffs are imposed on Chinese exports, as US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer threatened on Wednesday, China will not be the sole loser. Behind the White House's tough rhetoric and bragging about the US being in ""better shape"", US businesses know what a trade war means to them.  While touting the blow its trade war has dealt to industries in China, the White House would be deceiving itself by ignoring the calls from nearly 150 US business groups on Tuesday urging the president to reach a deal in Argentina.  Considering their diverging demands and agendas, it is unlikely that all-around solution to the current trade impasse will emerge from the meeting. However, it should be feasible for some kind of agreement to be reached to prevent the dispute worsening if both sides are reasonable.         "
Safety the priority; profits cannot come before lives: China Daily editorial,11/28/2018,"                          Photo taken on Nov 28, 2018 shows the blast site near Shenghua chemical plant in Zhangjiakou city, North China's Hebei province. [Photo/IC]   The explosion outside a chemical factory in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, which killed at least 23 people early on Wednesday, sounded another alarm for workplace safety nationwide.  A preliminary investigation by the local fire department and power supply company found the accident, which also left 22 people injured and dozens of trucks and passenger cars, as well as power lines, destroyed by fire, was caused by a truck carrying a combustible chemical exploding while waiting to enter the plant. Why it exploded is not yet known, though.  It followed a string of ""serious accidents"" in the country since October, each involving the deaths of at least 10 people. And although it will take some time to get the final results of the probe into what caused the tragedy in Zhangjiakou, failure to observe safety rules and procedures in handling hazardous materials is often the cause of such accidents.  The work safety authorities had warned enterprises and officials only this month to pay extra attention to safety as the number of accidents tends to increase as the year-end draws near, as it is the peak production season for many enterprises, and accidents are more likely to happen due to adverse weather conditions such as heavy snow and extremely low temperatures. They asked coal mines, chemical plants, fireworks factories, and the power and heating supply sectors to be especially careful.  The government has sought to improve workplace safety over the years, adopting a range of measures such as amending the law to allow for heavier penalties for those violating safety rules. And it is undeniable that much progress has been made. The country saw double-digit decreases in the number of workplace accidents and fatalities, by 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, last year.  Nonetheless, China's workplace death rate is more than 10 times higher than in developed countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Pursuit of higher profits at the expense of safety and lax government oversight are often cited as major reasons for this.  Which means even more stringent efforts are needed, especially in the enforcement of safety standards. It is not that there are not enough safety laws and regulations, but rather that often they are not properly enforced by local officials.  It is impossible to prevent all accidents, but as the country has already shown the number can be reduced if proper attention is paid to safety standards and procedures.         "
Restraint required to prevent Kerch Strait row exploding: China Daily editorial,11/28/2018,"                          The Nikopol gunboat (left) and the Yany Kapu tugboat of the Ukrainian Navy tugged to the Kerch Seaport on Nov 26, 2018. [Photo/IC]   Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have escalated quickly this week, drawing global concern. The two parties need to exercise utmost restraint so as to prevent the situation from spinning out of control. After all, a war on any scale would not serve the interests of either.  The latest round of their long simmering spat was triggered by Russia's seizure of three Ukraine warships on Sunday near the Kerch Strait, which separates the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Russia said the Ukrainian ships ignored the warnings of its border guards and crossed into Russian waters without authorization, while the Ukrainian Navy said it informed Russia in advance about the passage of the vessels.  In the wake of Sunday's incident, the Ukrainian parliament adopted a bill on Monday, imposing a martial law in certain regions of the country for 30 days starting Wednesday.  Considering that a martial law was not enforced by Ukraine during the 2014 crisis in the Crimea, the volatility of the Kerch Strait standoff this week is enough reason for the rest of the world to worry about another imminent clash between Ukraine and Russia.  If not handled properly, the strait may become a new flashpoint.  Some in the world arena even worry that the frictions may trigger a reaction against Russia from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has long thrown its weight behind Ukraine.  The seed of discord between Russia and Ukraine has been sowed by the latter's embrace of the West, as a result, Ukraine has become the venue for the West's competition with Russia.  Given the complexity of the Russia-Ukraine row, a de-escalation of tensions seems to be the most pressing goal for now. Although efforts to broker a permanent deal will be needed afterward.  For the two belligerent parties, they may want to look at the lessons of history and the experiences of other parts of world when facing conflict and confrontation of similar magnitude. Doing so would show that any provocations or rash actions usually have grave consequences. Both parties need to exercise restraint.  Meanwhile, the European Union, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and others have expressed their support for Ukraine, which is of course not surprising given their own frosty relations with Russia. They should not do anything to exacerbate an already volatile situation.         "
Only certainty of Brexit is it brings more uncertainty: China Daily editorial,11/27/2018,"                          Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends a news conference after an extraordinary EU leaders summit to finalise and formalise the Brexit agreement in Brussels, Belgium Nov 25, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called it ""the best deal possible"". British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was the ""only possible deal"".  But, significant as it is, the Brexit deal the other 27 EU leaders endorsed on Sunday in Brussels is no guarantee that the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the union will proceed smoothly. Instead, tougher bargaining awaits May both at home and with the European Union going forward.  What EU leaders approved on Sunday was a treaty setting the official terms for Brexit in March and an outline of future trade ties. Being an outline means numerous specifics at technical levels need to be sorted out. That is precisely where the toughest negotiations will be. Only they do not take place until after March, when the UK has officially departed.  Before that, the British prime minister faces the challenging task of pushing her deal through a less-than-supportive parliament.  May argued she has maneuvered the best deal that was possible, one that she says best serves the UK's interests and maintains a mutually beneficial partnership with the EU. But not everyone at home buys that claim. Given the dissent of her many vocal critics, she has a difficult fight ahead of Dec 11, when the House of Commons is expected to vote on the deal.  If she fails that test, and the probability cannot be excluded at this point, and if the EU insists on its current No-Plan-B position, things will turn very ugly. As one senior EU official was quoted as saying, the only Plan B was preparing a possible no-deal scenario where both the UK and the EU will suffer, not just economically.  To most observers, the UK has shot itself in the leg, and is busy arguing over the best way to treat the wound while it continues to bleed out. Unfortunately, that has consequences not only for itself, and the only certainty regarding Brexit and the UK-EU relationship in the next few months is there will be more uncertainty.  Along with that is the inevitability of broad reflections on the UK's identity as a European country, EU member, and its relationship with the rest of Europe, and possibly the need to rebuild it.

Investigation of human gene editing claim justified: China Daily editorial,11/27/2018,"                          He Jiankui speaks during an interview at a laboratory in Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong province in this Oct 10, 2018 photo. [Photo/IC]   That the National Health Commission ordered an investigation into the claim by a Chinese scientist to have done the first human gene editing immediately after the news broke on Monday suggests that the practice itself is problematic.  He Jiankui claimed to have created the world's first genetically edited babies with the approval of the ethics committee of a pediatric hospital in the city of Shenzhen. However, the hospital has denied this.  Southern University of Science and Technology where professor He used to work until early this year, and where he is still on the roster, said its biological academic committee believes that if what He claims is true, it would be a serious violation of medical ethics, and it too would conduct an investigation.  Indeed, voices from almost all relevant departments and other scientists point to this experiment not undergoing an ethical examination and gaining the needed approval.  A declaration jointly signed by 122 Chinese scientists and published online expressed strong opposition to and condemnation of this experiment, calling what He did ""crazy"".  That is not because the editing of the CCR5 gene of the two babies concerned was ill intended; He said it would prevent them from contracting HIV. But because, as the Chinese scientists said in their joint declaration, although human gene editing was feasible years ago, it has never been done because there are questions about its consequences and whether it is ethical.  Gene editing technology still leaves much to be desired when it comes to whether the gene being edited has been precisely targeted or whether the edited gene could develop some new functions that could negatively affect a person's health. That could eventually affect the entire human gene pool as the genes could be passed down from generation to generation.  A scientific experiment, such as this, which is closely related to human health, could be disastrous were it conducted without rigorous safety guarantees.  That explains why such experiments are still considered a no-no and human gene editing unethical.  There is no knowing why He did his experiment. It would be to his shame if he did it simply to gain fame.  So a thorough investigation is more than necessary and urgent. The truth behind the announcement that suggests such an experiment was conducted without approval needs to be clarified and any loopholes in the management of such sensitive scientific research must be closed.  We now have to wait and see what the health commission's investigation uncovers, so supervision can be effectively tightened.         "
Transparency best way to quell pollution concerns: China Daily editorial,11/26/2018,"                          Chinese rescuers clean contaminated water after the tube connecting the vessel and the wharf broke, leaking 6.97 tons of C9 aromatics in the water, at a port in Quanzhou city, China's Fujian province, Nov 9, 2018.[Photo/IC]   It is now clear that on Nov 4, 69.1 metric tons of the petroleum derivative C9 — rather than 6.97 tons as previously reported — leaked into the sea off Quanzhou, the most populous city in Fujian province.  The local government announced the results of the official investigation on Sunday, three weeks after the leak of the chemical that is toxic to humans and has already sickened more than 50 people and affected 20 hectares of aquatic farms, causing millions of yuan in economic loss.  The authorities said on Sunday that Fujian Donggang Petrochemical Industry had deliberately concealed and forged evidence to hide the true extent of the leak and some local officials had failed to play their supervisory role. Seven people have been detained.  The incident has once again exposed local officials need to improve their response to emergencies.  After the incident broke out, instead of trying to find out the exact amount of the leak by using professional methods, the local environmental officials just accepted the figure given by the company. Worse, they rushed to announce that all air and seawater pollution indexes were improving and back to normal, causing some credulous local residents who took part in cleanup work without any protection gear to fall sick.  Rather than halting all classes and outdoor activities for school students, as required when an environmental emergency occurs, the local education department failed to notify teachers and parents of the possible dangers and classes continued as normal.  And rather than keeping the public well-informed, local police ""accompanied"" reporters, and one journalist from Caixin disclosed how she was tailed, prevented from taking pictures, and harassed by police when trying to investigate the incident.  In the face of the continuous public doubts over the scale of the pollution, the local officials repeatedly asked the local people not to believe and spread rumors, rather than addressing their concerns with timely updates on the findings of their investigation.  It was pure luck that the leak this time was not any larger, or the consequences could have been more devastating. Still it will take a long time for the damage done to the credibility of the local government to be repaired.  This is a lesson that should be learned by all government officials nationwide.

Reform should facilitate WTO in maintaining fair trade: China Daily editorial,11/25/2018,"                          World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevedo speaks at the opening ceremony for the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China on Nov 5, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   If there is consensus on whether World Trade Organization should be reformed, how the world body should be reformed is at issue. But whatever a particular country pursues with this reform, one principle needs to be maintained: The multilateral trade regime must be protected and the role it plays in facilitating global free trade should never be undermined.  The proposals the Ministry of Commerce put forward on the weekend are so meant.  One of the proposals requires that the reform should tackle the most urgent problems the WTO faces: unilateralism and protectionism, the practices of which have become stumbling blocks preventing the relevant WTO mechanisms from performing their roles.  Rather than being made a tool of any country, the WTO needs to make its rules fair. It is obviously unfair for some developed countries to subsidize their agriculture, the practice of which has long distorted the global trade in agricultural products in favor of these countries. In anti-dumping investigations, the third country as substitute is also unfair and has seriously distorted the order of world trade.  China also maintains that the WTO rules need to make sure that the developing countries get the special and differentiated treatment they deserve for their development. The proposals also say that the reform should require some WTO members to scrap their discriminative investigations against imports and investment in the name of national security.  China, of course, hopes that the WTO reform will protect its own legitimate interests but not at the cost of those of other countries. What China wants is a global trade environment where trade can be carried out for all countries in a fair manner.         The World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters are pictured in Geneva, Switzerland, July 26, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   But there are those countries that want to turn the WTO into their own instrument so that the world trade body's rules are tilted in their favor or want to use it to ""put China in a tailor-made straightjacket of trade rules"".  Maintaining fair play is what the WTO is supposed to do. If any reform is meant to turn the world body into a tool to contain the development of a particular country or facilitate the trade of a particular country at the cost of other countries, such reform will go nowhere.  The reform should cement the authoritativeness of the world trade body and consolidate its leadership in the multilateral trading system. Any reform with the intention of seeking unilateral gains or other ulterior motives will do otherwise.         "
DPP's election loss wake-up call for a change of course: China Daily editorial,11/25/2018,"                          File Photo: Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. [Photo/IC]   Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen announced her resignation as the chair of the Democratic Progressive Party late on Saturday, to take responsibility for the party's defeat in Taiwan's local elections.  In the elections of mayors and major civil servants for 22 cities and counties of the island — widely deemed to be a mid-term examination of the Tsai administration since it took power in 2016, as well as a barometer for the island's election in 2020 — the DPP won the mayor's seats in six cities and counties, Kuomintang 15, and a nonparty candidate won one. The question is: Why did the Tsai administration lose people's support so fast?  The people are unhappy that the administration has not pulled Taiwan's economy out of quasi-stagnation. The island's economic growth was 2.64 percent last year, markedly lower than the world average of 3.7 percent.  And some of its policies have ignored the interests of many groups, who were reluctant to vote for the DPP's candidates in the local elections this time.  Moreover, despite Beijing's cooperative stance, Tsai's wheeler-dealer denial of the 1992 Consensus has forced the cross-Straits ties into a deadlock. The Tsai administration's secessionist stance has not only soured its crucial relations with the Chinese mainland, but also made it unpopular with people on both sides of the straits.  The administration's beggar-thy-neighbor practices have only stewed Taiwan in its own juice. In the past two years, the number of tourists from the Chinese mainland, the largest source of tourism revenue for Taiwan, has slumped by 40 percent.  Taking the initiative to quit her job as chair of the DPP, Tsai, who had exhausted her means to beg for United States' protection and endorsement, must have also realized it is not only her economic policies, but also her separatist stance that has lost her the support of the people on the island.  Cross-Straits communication and cooperation between local governments are expected to be strengthened as a result of the election, which will bring more opportunities and help deepen mutual understanding.  The election shows that the Tsai administration has betrayed Taiwan's interests and become a troublemaker whose actions have drifted farther away from the practical needs of the Taiwan people and the historical truth of the consensus there is only one China. This has led to the administration encountering a cold shoulder whenever it has tried to wrangle any kind of recognition for a separate status for the island within the international community.  The DPP's heavy defeat in the elections should awaken the Tsai administration from its illusions.         "
Reform should reinforce primary purpose of WTO: China Daily editorial,11/22/2018,"                          [Photo / IC]   In a sign of the escalating tensions between the United States and its major trading partners, the World Trade Organization agreed on Wednesday to hear complaints from the European Union and countries such as China, Canada and Mexico over new US steel and aluminum tariffs — imposed on national security grounds — as well as complaints from Washington over retaliatory duties.  And in a thinly veiled warning to the world trade body, the US delegation said any review of its measures taken for national security reasons would undermine the ""legitimacy"" and ""even the viability of the WTO as a whole"".  Such is the tough stance as adopted by the White House, which has blocked judicial appointments to the WTO, that it risks paralyzing its system of trade dispute settlement. The US has even threatened to quit the WTO if it does not ""shape up"".  No one questions that the WTO urgently needs to reform. Twenty-three years after it was founded, the world body that sets the rules governing global trade is facing multiple challenges that range from improving its dispute settlement system, and cutting agricultural subsidies to increasing market access.  But if the US wants to turn the WTO into a tool for it to meet its own particular needs in the name of reform, or even use it to ""put China in a tailor-made straitjacket of trade rules"" to constrain its growth — as China's ambassador to the WTO Zhang Xiangchen said — it will definitely fail.  Washington has shown it is willing to pay no heed to international rules it perceives as not serving its own interests, while brazenly accusing China of breaking WTO rules.  In fact, as the world's largest trader, China is shouldering the responsibility of safeguarding the rules-based system and it is holding the banner for WTO reforms, which it hopes can make the world body function more effectively.  The WTO, including its dispute settlement system, was not set up, as US President Donald Trump has claimed, ""for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States"". It was set up to facilitate global trade.  And as China says, reform of the WTO does not mean reinventing the wheel, nor is it an excuse for not implementing the rules.  The aim should be to strengthen the authoritativeness and leadership of the WTO in the multilateral trading system, so it can rein in protectionism and better promote free trade and economic globalization.

US will also suffer from its control of technology export: China Daily editorial,11/21/2018,"                      That the US stock market dropped sharply immediately after the US government put forward the proposal on Tuesday to tighten the control on exports of various artificial intelligence technologies indicates what the market thinks of the move.  The down vote is recognition that the flow of capital in pursuit of innovations and their commercialization has been a driving force for economic globalization, which has been highly profitable for tech companies and those countries in the vanguard of science and technology developments.  Multinational corporations have led the way in the profound compressing of time and space that has flattened and changed the world over the last couple of decades, and the overwhelming majority of international technological transfers have been conducted among multinational companies in pursuit of profits.  Thus the proposal the US government put forward on Tuesday to tighten the control to ""avoid negatively impacting US leadership in the science, technology, engineering and manufacturing sector"" is being viewed not only as a brake on the US economy but also as a hindrance to maintaining that leadership since it will reduce cooperation with the rest of the world and shrink the market for US companies de-incentivizing them to invest in R&D.  The bigger its market, the more profits a technology company can earn, and the more money it then has to invest in developing even more advanced technologies. This is as true for US companies as it is for others.  Behind the proposal is the narrow-mindedness of policymakers in the US administration, who choose to ignore the fact that the United States would not have become the world leader in science and technology if it had kept its doors closed.  If such controls are intended to contain China's development, they will certainly fail.  It is true that China has a lot to do to catch up with the US and other developed countries. Yet it has made great steps forward by opening its doors and cooperating with other economies.  As it opens its door wider, it will have even more opportunities to cooperate with other countries in science and technology.  The dematerialization of economic activities — with economic output and income generation increasingly reliant on information rather than inputs of raw materials — only increases the need for cooperative agreements and a cross-disciplinary approach to enhance the capabilities of AI and advance its application.  By trying to enforce and exploit an invented-here ideal that is untenable, the US will undoubtedly undermine the leadership in science and technology to which it has become accustomed, and impede the progress of both humans and machines.

Its FTA with China is good for the Maldives: China Daily editorial,11/21/2018,"                      Only days after the Maldives' new government came to power, it has said it will pull out of a free trade agreement with China because it was a mistake for such a small country to sign such a deal with the world's second-largest economy. Mohamed Nasheed, the chief of the Maldivian Democratic Party, which leads the ruling federal alliance, cited the huge trade imbalance between the two countries and called the FTA a ""one-way treaty"" that only benefits China. The deal, the first of its kind for the Maldives, was signed during former president Abdulla Yameen's state visit to Beijing last December after two years of negotiations. It removed the trade barriers between the two countries as it cut the tariffs on more than 95 percent of goods to zero, and opened up the ""world's largest consumer market"" to goods from the Maldives, particularly fishery products, which are its main exports. It is absurd, and even ill willed, to suggest a free trade deal with China and participation in the China-led Belt and Road Initiative would push the Maldives into a debt trap. The archipelago of around 1,200 islands has always been dependent on imports, and given the nature of the economy, the country has always maintained a considerable current account deficit with the rest of the world. China is also the largest source of tourists for the Maldives, with 248,000 Chinese tourists visiting the country in the first 10 months of this year, one-fifth of all foreign visitors it received. The FTA is expected to help the Maldives to meet its goal of increasing tourist arrivals from the current 1.5 million to 7-8 million each year, as restrictions ease for Chinese investors to upgrade its infrastructure to meet surging demand. The win-win practical cooperation encouraged by the FTA will be a boon for the Maldives' coffers and consumers, and has nothing to do with geopolitics, as some critics have suggested. Given that after the deal was agreed, the opposition party criticized Yameen sharply for being too ""pro-China"", it is not a surprise that the new government in Male is saying it will dump the deal. Yet discontinuity in national policies due to opposition for opposition's sake or because of the needless concerns of India, which is worried China might establish a naval base in the Maldives in spite of China's denials, would come at the unnecessarily high cost of its economic interests.

Xi's trip to Manila affirms ties back on right track: China Daily editorial,11/20/2018,"                      How Beijing and Manila have successfully overcome their maritime dispute and strengthened their cooperation has set a good example for the region by showing that differences do not need to be obstacles to friendly relations. President Xi Jinping's visit to the Philippines, the first by a Chinese president in 13 years, was a significant step, as it mapped out a new blueprint for comprehensive strategic cooperative relations between the two countries. It is heartening to see both Xi and his Philippine counterpart President Rodrigo Duterte spoke highly of bilateral ties when they met on Tuesday. Such warm words would have been unimaginable two years ago when bilateral ties deteriorated due to the previous Philippine government's provocations and confrontational approach to the maritime dispute. Western media have been trying to play up the fact that Xi is visiting a US ally, in a bid to sensationalize the tensions between China and the United States, which they see as vying for influence in the region. A perception that US Vice-President Mike Pence fueled with his divisive remarks at the APEC meeting in Papua New Guinea on the weekend. But while that might be the game the US is playing, it is not what China is doing. It would be more to the point to say that Xi is visiting a close neighbor and consolidating the good momentum in relations that has been fostered since Duterte reopened the door to cooperation. Last year, the trade volume between the two countries topped $50 billion, and the newly added investment from China reached $53.84 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 67 percent. But as well as their economic cooperation, they are also making joint efforts to combat illegal drugs and terrorism, and promote people-to-people exchanges. The strong development momentum in China-Philippines ties strikes another positive note in China's neighborhood diplomacy, as well as in its interaction with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, at a time when China and the regional bloc are jointly working to advance consultations on the Code of Conduct to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. Xi's remarks when he spoke with Duterte in Manila on Tuesday, reinforced his words at the APEC meeting, that China is sincere in wanting to form a community for common development in the region. And as China and the Philippines have shown, by putting the contentious issues on one track and areas in which they can promote mutually beneficial cooperation on another, the region can foster a friendly neighborhood in which all can prosper. Both Beijing and Manila need to continue to build on the current desirable picture so that their hard-won results in repairing and promoting bilateral ties are not disrupted by the US and its zero-sum games.

EU self-harming by shutting door on Chinese investment: China Daily editorial,11/19/2018,"                      The new restrictions on investment expected to be introduced by the European Union belie its commitment to free trade and globalization, and will put a brake on the momentum of Chinese investment in the EU, which does not bode well for their strategic partnership — or indeed the economies of some EU members.  In sharp contrast with China's recent efforts to open its market wider to foreign investment, by significantly improving its market access, the EU has drafted its first unified rules to restrict foreign investment on security grounds.  Agreement on a draft legislation to screen foreign direct investment is expected to be reached between the European Parliament and EU governments on Tuesday, with the supposed aim of countering threats to ""critical infrastructure"" in the energy, transport, communications and financial industries and ""critical technologies"" such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. Since these are the areas in which Chinese companies are now looking to invest, the restrictive measures are widely viewed as targeting China.  Chinese investment has been flowing into Europe, especially since the global financial crisis, creating jobs and helping lift many EU members out of their economic doldrums. In 2017, China's annual investment in Europe reached $42 billion, as compared with $840 million in 2008. Total Chinese investment in Europe during the period surpassed that in the United States by 45 percent.  Yet many Chinese companies seeking a foothold in Europe have already been excluded from takeovers or government contracts in certain sectors on what are claimed to be national security grounds.  Fears in Europe that Chinese investments may threaten the bloc's security are politically motivated; there is nothing to indicate that Chinese investment has threatened, is threatening or will threaten European security in any field, in any way.  Confronted with the growing competitiveness of Chinese companies in sectors in which they are used to being the undisputed leaders, there is a heightened sense of strategic crisis in the EU and other developed economies, which has prompted them to close their doors to Chinese investment. Yet doing so will only hurt their economies.  Successful companies based in the developed countries became multinationals by investing overseas, it is natural that Chinese companies that now have the wherewithal should seek to do likewise.  The EU and the US should bear in mind that China is the most successful large economy in the world in modern times and its economic development derives from its opening-up. Attracting foreign investment has helped boost its economy, and Chinese investments can now inject fresh momentum into other economies, including the EU.         "
Referendum on 'proper name' for Olympics team is ridiculous: China Daily editorial,11/18/2018,"                          A child waves a Chinese national flag and an Olympic flag during a ceremony to mark the arrival of the Olympic flag and start of the flag tour for the Winter Olympic Games Beijing 2022 at a section of the Great Wall of China on the outskirts of Beijing, Feb 27, 2018. [Photo/IC]   The referendum some political forces in Taiwan are seeking on ""a proper name"" for the island's athletes to participate in the Olympics is both absurd and dangerous.  Under the rules of the International Olympic Committee the island takes part in the Olympic Games under the name of ""Chinese Taipei"". Such a practice conforms to the one-China principle and makes it possible for athletes on the island to take part in international events as a team.  This technical arrangement the International Olympic Committee has made upholds the international consensus that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.  However, a small number of secessionists on the island is not satisfied with this, and they are trying to challenge the bottom line of the Chinese mainland by doing whatever they can to manifest their stand for the island's ""independence"", although it cannot be any clearer that any attempts in that direction will hit a dead end.  The Taiwan authorities' refusal to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus on the one-China principle has undoubtedly worsened the otherwise smooth development of cross-Straits relations. The Democratic Progressive Party, which is in office, has, to a large extent, connived with or even been behind the secessionists' ""independence"" antics.  What the DPP wants now is to divert people's attention from the local elections and from the declining approval rating for Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. Even if the referendum does not work, they want to make trouble.  But if the island's authorities continue to maintain their stand of not acknowledging the one-China principle and give tacit support to secessionist maneuvers such as this ""referendum"", it is not hard to imagine what will be the outcome for cross-Straits relations.  What the DPP and Taiwan authorities fail to recognize is the fact that more people on the island suffer from the worsening cross-Straits relations the less inclined they will be to buy what they are touting.  Since they are losing support because of the way they have chosen to deal with the mainland, how can this referendum reverse the trend in their favor?         "
APEC must follow trend of times toward shared future: China Daily editorial,11/18/2018,"                          A security officer walks outside of Jacksons International Airport in Papua New Guinea, Nov 14, 2018. [Photo/IC]   Thanks to their embracing of free trade and investment facilitation, the 21 APEC members, which include the world's most robust growth engines, now account for 60 percent of the global GDP and 47 percent of global trade.  But the commitment of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation members to their 1994 agreement to pursue the reducing barriers to trade and investment and promote the free flow of goods, services and capital — the Bogor Goals that have facilitated the region's dynamism — has never been tested as much as it is today, with the beggar-thy-neighbor approach of unilateralism gumming up the works like sugared gasoline.  Although supposedly flying the flag for a rules-based region, the petulant me-first mentality on display at the 26th Economic Leaders' Summit in Papua New Guinea was again a disruptive presence seeking to subvert efforts to foster a greater sense of community and shared development.  President Xi Jinping's speech at the summit on Sunday was strong rallying call for countries to stand together and reject the take-what-you-can approach in favor of regional integration that promotes an open and rule-abiding economy in the Asia-Pacific.  It was a call for action to embody the feeling he evoked in his speech at the APEC CEO Summit on board the cruise ship Pacific Explorer on Saturday. ""I was looking at the vast ocean when I boarded the ship,"" he said, ""and it struck me that we are all indeed fellow passengers in the same boat."" He encouraged those present to make the right choice — which is not between following this country or that country — but rather between cooperation and confrontation, openness and closing one's door, win-win progress or a zero-sum game.  The choice facing the region and the world is a stark one: One path leads to progress, the other is a self- and all-defeating choice that leads back to the faultlines of the past.  Leaders in the region share a common responsibility to chart a peaceful and long-term development course for Asia-Pacific, as it enters its digital future.The APEC leaders should continue to uphold a rules-based region and work to sustain the momentum of Asia-Pacific cooperation.  By forging closer relationships and jointly meeting common challenges, the APEC members have remained true to the shared goal of common development while respecting diversity and each other's choices of development path. By continuing to do so, they can draw up a post-2020 roadmap and advance the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which will help realize a regional community with a shared future.         "
Pence's remarks show who the real troublemaker is: China Daily editorial,11/15/2018,"                          US Vice-President Mike Pence during a meeting with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, not seen, in Singapore, Nov 14, 2018. [Photo/IC]   In remarks that carried a barely veiled swipe at China, US Vice-President Mike Pence told leaders of Southeast Asian nations in Singapore on Thursday that ""empire and aggression have no place"" in the region.  Yet in referring to it as ""the Indo-Pacific"" at a summit of Southeast Asian leaders, he once again showed that is what the United States is bringing to the Asia-Pacific.  Yet his bid to pit China against its Asia-Pacific neighbors will find no takers, because it was so out of sync with what the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and its related meetings were focusing on — enhanced trade, and peace and security in the region.  Talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - which would create the world's largest trade bloc - continued to make progress this week and the negotiations are expected to be concluded next year.  And while Pence intimated that China was a hostile presence in the region - a threat to both sovereignty and values - his view was at odds with both the views of leaders in the region and with the reality.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said at the summit that relations between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors were ""excellent"". And despite the maritime territorial disputes that exist between China and some of the ASEAN members, the two sides have agreed to finalize a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea in three years to maintain peace and security in the region.  Indeed, the ASEAN meetings in Singapore have highlighted who the real troublemaker is, as, on his way from Tokyo to Singapore, the US vice-president saw fit to conduct a so-called freedom of navigation mission by flying some 30 kilometers from Chinese islands in the South China Sea. These contentious military maneuvers merely create the risk of an incident and serve to show how ubiquitous and provocative the US military presence is in the region even though there is no threat to its interests.  If you take away the cause, the effects cease.  The US administration's ""America first"" policies are antithetical to the concerted efforts of countries in the region to uphold the common good through greater integration, free trade and dialogue.  And its world-is-ours mindset may help people better understand where Pence's ""aggression and empire"" remark was coming from.         "
Diplomatic moves show China will not be cowed: China Daily editorial,11/15/2018,"                          A general view shows the APEC Haus building in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, August 10, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   With President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang both on visits to the Asia-Pacific region to attend international meetings this week, China is sending a strong message to the outside world that it is attaching more attention and importance to countries in its neighborhood and looking to strike an even more resonant note in implementing its neighborhood diplomacy.  From Nov 15 to 21, Xi is visiting Papua New Guinea, Brunei, and the Philippines and attending the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Papua New Guinea. And Li began an official trip to Singapore on Monday to engage in bilateral talks and to attend a series of meetings on East Asia cooperation with the leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the bloc's regional partners including Japan and the Republic of Korea.  During their trips the two leaders will be reinforcing the message that China is opening its doors wider for business and it is committed to common development and shared benefits.  As a practical demonstration of this, at their meeting on Wednesday, the leaders of China and the 10-member bloc adopted the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which set out a blueprint for upgrading their cooperation.  This new cooperation framework has been forged in the year that marks the 15th anniversary of the China-ASEAN strategic partnership. It is supported by the three pillars of political and security cooperation, economic ties and people-to-people exchanges, reflecting the common aspiration of both sides to build a region of enduring peace and stability.  The vision is one of further integration and mutually-beneficial cooperation and provides a road map to narrow the development gaps in the region to the benefit of both sides.  Such a desirable picture, which is bolstered by China's recent efforts in improving and enhancing ties with other regional partners including the ROK, India, Japan and Australia, will in turn help China in its efforts to promote the building of a regional community with a shared future.  The trade war China has been dragged into by the United States has brought home to the region the necessity and importance of strengthening ties to uphold the world trade system.  By injecting even more vitality into its neighborhood diplomacy, China is helping to foster a dynamic Asia-Pacific, which will give it the confidence to stand up to the trade bullying of the United States, which in turn will be good for the Asia-Pacific.

Nationalism poses test for transatlantic ties: China Daily editorial,11/14/2018,"                          French President Emmanuel Macron attends a commemoration ceremony for Armistice Day, 100 years after the end of World War I, at the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris, France, Nov 11, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   In his speech commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War I on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that self-interested nationalism marked ""a betrayal of patriotism"". The reverberations of his words were felt from across the Atlantic Ocean.  Because, as is his wont when he feels he has been slighted in some way, US President Donald Trump fired off a caustic series of early-morning tweets. On Tuesday, his salvo was against Macron, and his proposal that Europeans should defend Europe, as well as the bilateral trade deficit.  Since one of the tweets was remarkably insensitive given the occasion, it seems the earlier claims of camaraderie no longer apply.  The tweets have laid bare the widening divergences between Europe and the United States, which have become ever more apparent with each reaching of hands across the water. The traditional cross-Atlantic alliance is being tested more from within than by any challenge that had brought them together.  Given that, and Europe's history in the last century, it was no surprise to hear German Chancellor Angela Merkel warn against the rise of narrow nationalism, isolationism and the dire consequences that refusing communication and compromise might cause when speaking at the Paris Peace Forum on Sunday. Two days later, she too voiced clear support for the idea of a common European defense by telling a session of the European Parliament that Europe must ""take our fate into our own hands"".  Given their recollections of how a land of prosperity quickly became a land of self-brought death and destruction, European countries have every reason to call for cooperation and communication, and remain vigilant to the rise of nationalism or isolationism.  With the White House choosing to take offense at even minor or imagined pricks to its ego, and resorting to appeals to the red, white and blue at the slightest affront, it is giving an object lesson in how to lose friends.  The transatlantic bond between the US and Europe is showing signs of strain, and it is right for Europe to reflect on what it gains from that in a world that has fundamentally changed from how it was in the days that bond was forged.  Whether the US still has the will to be the world leader, as it emerged after the devastation of two world wars, is not really the question. The question now is, does it have any answers for the world's pressing challenges for it to be perceived as a leader by anyone else.         "
Brexit still unsettled despite agreed terms of divorce: China Daily editorial,11/14/2018,"                          An anti-Brexit demonstrator hold placards opposite the Houses of Parliament, in London, Britain, Nov 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Brexit has been compared to someone leaving a marital house to put an end to the arguments, only to find that their former spouse is keeping the house, the car and the joint bank accounts.  Which while not entirely accurate hints at why it has been so hard for Britain and the European Union to strike a deal, as both parties want to feel that they have had the upper hand in the negotiations on their divorce settlement, and both feel they have been wronged for one reason or another.  It seems that they have finally come to an agreement, as it was announced on Tuesday that a technical agreement has been reached to end their union after more than a year of hard talks.  That will be a relief to those fearing the uncertainty of a no deal as the clock remorselessly counts down the days. A deal on Brexit must be struck before the Wednesday deadline for Britain and the EU to call the special summit to seal it later this month. Failure would delay the final settlement, leaving little time for British Prime Minister Theresa May to get the deal and associated legislation through parliament in time for Britain's withdrawal from the bloc next March.  May sees it as her mission to avoid the so-called hard-Brexit, a scenario that many fear would throw the country into chaos. She has done all she could to minimize disruption by keeping her compromise Brexit plan - which seeks to leave the EU but maintain closer trade ties with it - on track. It remains to be seen whether she will be able to achieve that, but at least she has navigated the first hurdle.  That may give her some relief, but probably only temporarily. She still has to get approval from her cabinet and parliament.  So far it seems mission impossible, as she is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans and even some of her own ministers. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Brexit in July, said the deal would leave Britain a ""vassal state"" and asked his former colleagues to ""chuck it out"".  Which means her efforts may be in vain since a no-deal or even no-exit remains a possibility.  May once said she remained ""confident"" that the government could strike ""a good deal"", but in the event of a no-deal, Britain would be ready if need be to go on and thrive.  Many in Britain and elsewhere will be hoping those words are not put to the test.         "
"Region rallies to support multilateralism, free trade: China Daily editorial",11/13/2018,"                          Premier Li Keqiang arrives in Singapore for an official visit and East Asian meetings, Nov 12, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   In his speech addressing a business forum in Singapore on Tuesday, Premier Li Keqiang struck a resonant note on multilateralism, stressing that the world should not shun the principles of multilateralism and free trade, and neither does it need to reinvent the wheel.  Indeed, with some countries embracing unilateralism and protectionism, the world needs to shore up the spirit of multilateralism and win-win cooperation more than ever. In this regard, it is heartening to see Li and other regional leaders attending the series of meetings on East Asia cooperation in Singapore this week showing a shared commitment to regional cooperation and integration.  Like the other parts of the world, East Asia has been a beneficiary of globalization. The blueprint of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for building the ASEAN Economic Community, with the support of its regional partners including China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, is itself a reflection of the region's desire to ride the wave of globalization and free trade.  ASEAN's community building, together with various other regional economic cooperation vehicles that have been established, have formed a launchpad for countries in the region to pursue a much more ambitious goal — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  The negotiations on the RCEP have quickened since last year after the Donald Trump administration pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The RCEP is widely perceived as an antidote to the TPP, which was originally championed by the US and deliberately excluded the participation of big countries such as China and India. The RCEP would form the world's largest economic bloc, covering nearly half of the global economy, and thus would firmly anchor the multilateral trading system.  Significant progress is expected to be made in the complex negotiations this week, and the 16 countries, including China, Japan, India and the 10 members of ASEAN, are expected to finalize the deal next year. Such a desirable achievement would be instrumental in fending off the headwinds of trade protectionism and unilateralism, and would ""deliver real benefits to people in the region"", as Li said.  The efforts to realize the RCEP, along with concurrent efforts to facilitate talks on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, show the region is standing together to reject a beggar-thy-neighbor approach in favor of equitable and rule-based free trade and international cooperation that helps each country and its neighbors to prosper alike.

Reform and opening-up still the crucial choice: China Daily editorial,11/13/2018,"                          Beijing's CBD area. [Photo/VCG]   China will not stop its reform and opening-up. Reform and opening-up have brought China to where it is today, and China will only deepen its reforms and open its doors wider as it pursues its development.  While this is essential for the country to achieve its goals of realizing a moderately well-off society and national rejuvenation, it will also benefit the world.  In today's globalized world, China's development is closely related to that of other countries and vice versa. So its ongoing reform and opening-up will propel not just its own economic growth and social progress, but also contribute tremendously to the world economy as they will create fresh opportunities for the world.  An exhibition to mark the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up this year opened in Beijing on Tuesday. It shows what this country has achieved over the past four decades, and demonstrates why China will continue to open up to the outside world. Speaking while visiting the exhibition, President Xi Jinping said that the country will implement the thought for a new era and follow the blueprint for the future that has been drawn up. Its deployment demonstrates the leadership's resolve to continue reform and opening-up and create advantageous conditions to realize their full potential.  As he said on Nov 5 in his speech at the opening of the import expo, history shows that openness and cooperation are the driving forces for dynamic international economic and trade activities.  That is not just because of how economic reform and opening-up have transformed China over the past four decades, but also because of what they have contributed to the world.  It is the reform and opening-up over the past 40 years that have made China's economy the ocean that it is, and Xi said that China will further tap its potential for imports, continue to widen access to its market and create a top class business environment, which promises even greater contributions to the prosperity of the world economy.  And as China continues to advance reforms, such as streamlining bureaucratic procedures and further opens up through initiatives such as the expansion of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, it hopes other countries will join it in opposing unilateralism and trade protectionism.  For, as Xi said, the practices of the law of the jungle and winner takes all are just dead end. Inclusive growth for all is surely the right way forward.         "
Draft law heralds strict vaccine management: China Daily editorial,11/12/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   How to plug all the loopholes that have been revealed by repeated vaccine scandals involving makers and local watchdogs in recent years became a pressing concern after the most recent scare involving the production of substandard vaccines by Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences Limited.  President Xi Jinping called that incident hideous and said that people's health should always be a top priority. The bottom line of safety should be resolutely safeguarded, he said.  Which is what a new law on the management of vaccines aims to do.  Legal articles concerning the supervision over research, production and distribution of vaccines, and their administering are currently scattered among various laws, a state of affairs that has allowed unscrupulous profiteering and lax production standards to put people’s health at risk. To better regulate the production of vaccines and prevent any substandard or fake vaccines entering the market a single law stipulating how they are to be made, sold, distributed and administered has been long overdue.  Thus the draft of a new vaccine law that has been released by the State Administration of Market Regulation on Sunday for public opinions has been greeted with enthusiasm.  The strict supervision and management set out in the draft, if practiced as specified, will effectively close the loopholes that have been found and preempt any substandard practices or wrongdoing in the production process.  The draft shows that the research, production and distribution of vaccines as well as their use and the observation of reactions to inoculations will be placed under corresponding supervision and management.  Severe penalties are of course more than necessary to deter potential offenders, and the draft stipulates that anyone who fabricates data or documents involving the production of vaccines should be given the severest penalties according to the law as should those who intentionally try to cover up their behavior.  Record keeping is also required at every stage to guarantee traceability, with any laxity or omission to be held accountable.  All these measures are necessary and welcome. Nevertheless, even with a better law, to guarantee the bottom line of safe-to-use vaccines, it is necessary to ensure there is a rigorous supervisory environment to make certain the law is implemented to the letter. That is no less important than the making of a good law.  With the introduction of a new law specifically covering vaccines and stringent supervision to ensure it fulfills the intended purpose, people will be able to have renewed confidence in immunization as a protector of health.

"China, Singapore to advance bilateral, regional relations: China Daily editorial",11/12/2018,"                      In a sign that the all-around cooperative partnership between China and Singapore has progressed with the times, Premier Li Keqiang started a five-day official visit to the Southeast Asian country with a meeting with his Singaporean counterpart on Monday.  His visit, during which he is also scheduled to attend the 33rd ASEAN Summit and related meetings, caps off a year of engagement between both countries, which have enjoyed friendly relations for decades. Although small in size, Singapore has played an indispensable role in China's reform and opening-up, by generously sharing its development experience with Chinese leaders as China transitioned from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. And over the years, Singapore has helped train hundreds of thousands of Chinese officials in public administration and economic management.  Bilateral relations suffered a setback in 2016 due to the flaring of regional tensions over the South China Sea disputes, but the fact that they quickly returned to a normal track, with a visit by Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Beijing in September last year, reflects the importance the two countries place on their bilateral relations and their ability to manage their differences.  And despite that blip in relations, China has remained Singapore's largest trade partner, and Singapore, China's largest investor. Singapore is also an ardent supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative, with the country becoming the largest destination for Chinese investment along the Belt and Road routes.  Cooperation under the framework of the initiative has already borne fruits, such as the Chongqing Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity — the third of their government-to-government projects after Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City - which is helping drive the growth of China's less-developed western region through better transport, financing and data connectivity.  And with protectionism on the rise, China and Singapore have both expressed their resolve to safeguard the global system of free trade. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee on Monday called for more regional integration, saying multilateralism was under threat. And Singaporean media published an article by Li on the same day, in which the Chinese premier called for an ""open world economy"" in the face of ""rising protectionism and unilateralism"". The two sides are widely expected to ink an upgraded free trade deal during Li's visit.  As Singapore has assumed the presidency of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, the good relations between the two sides could help accelerate the negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, an ASEAN-led free trade pact that will encompass more than one-third of the world's GDP.  All of which indicates Sino-Singaporean relations will continue to flourish.         "
Building of political trust essential for China-US ties: China Daily editorial,11/11/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The conciliatory remarks by senior officials of China and the United States on Friday, after the conclusion of the second round of the China-US Diplomatic and Security Dialogue in Washington, should have enabled those worrying about the deteriorating bilateral relations to let out a sigh of relief.  The trade frictions that have strained bilateral ties in the past several months are evidence that much needs to be done to promote political trust between Beijing and Washington.  Thus it was reassuring to hear US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tell a joint news conference immediately after the meeting that: ""The United States is not pursuing a Cold War or containment policy with China, rather, we want to ensure that China acts responsibly and fairly in support of security and prosperity in each of our two countries.""  On his part, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, also said that China is not trying to challenge any nation, and everything it does is to deliver a better life for the Chinese people and to realize the rejuvenation of the nation.  Yang, who is also director of the CPC Central Committee's Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission, said that China is committed to reform and opening-up and peaceful development.  It is natural for both countries to have differences on various issues, but those divergences should not preclude cooperation.  With the top leaders of the two countries expected to talk on the sidelines of the G20 summit later this month, it is essential that both sides work to consolidate this expressed willingness to work together and continue to discuss ways to end their trade frictions and find more common ground on which to lay the foundations for more stable relations.  The remarks made by US government officials, including the vice-president, suggest some in the US administration have fundamental misunderstandings and misjudgments about China's policies and intentions.  It is arrogance bordering on delusion to deny that healthier bilateral ties would be better for everyone. The two sides should wipe the slate clean and redraw the paradigm for their relations.  By respecting each other's sovereignty and security interests, and strengthening their coordination on trade, the two sides can build political trust for better relations.         "
Expo rallies support for multilateral trading: China Daily editorial,11/11/2018,"                          Signs promoting the China International Import Expo at Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai on Oct 17, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Aside from its tangible outcomes in terms of deals - a total intended transaction volume of $57.83 billion - the first China International Import Expo that concluded in Shanghai on Saturday was also tangible proof that China is continuing to open its doors and widening its market access to the rest of the world.  Speaking at the opening of the expo on Monday, President Xi Jinping said that openness, innovation and inclusiveness have become the hallmarks of Shanghai. And he said that having worked in the city he knew personally how important they were for its development.  So it should perhaps come as no surprise to learn that the expo was proposed, planned and promoted by Xi himself as a means to consolidate confidence in China's resolve to further open up to the world and its willingness to share its development dividends and opportunities with others.  For by taking the initiative to open its doors even wider, the world's second-largest economy will not only promote its own development, it will also create more benefits for the world.  More than 3,600 participating companies and representatives from 172 countries, regions and international organizations attended the expo in the knowledge that according to what is regarded as a cautious estimate, China will import more than $30 trillion of commodities and $10 trillion of services over the next 15 years.  And the fact that the annual online shopping carnival of China's largest e-commerce platform on Nov 11 generated 100 billion yuan ($14.38 billion) in one hour and 48 minutes on Sunday, will not have gone unnoticed.  Many foreign companies already appreciate the power of e-commerce in driving their business in China, and more will be looking to follow its example. The development of the digital economy in China speaks volumes not only about the increased purchasing power of Chinese consumers but also the country's commitment to development and progress, which it knows can only come from openness.  In her speech at the expo on Tuesday International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Largard spoke of how China is building three bridges — a bridge to the world through reform and opening-up, a bridge to prosperity through promoting global trade, and a bridge to the future through facilitating cooperation.  These are all being built to promote inclusiveness and common development, for despite the blows and smears that it has suffered as a result, China has remained steadfast in opposing protectionism and unilateralism.  Hosting such a high-level import fair was a practical action to rally support for an open world economy. Its success shows that many appreciate that for a beautiful spring all flowers need to fully blossom.         "
"Reconciliation of Beijing, Canberra good for region: China Daily editorial",11/8/2018,"                          Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne. [Photo/Agencies]   In his meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Thursday, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China's development is not a threat to Australia but an opportunity. This is an important message that should be well received by the Australian side as it holds the key for Canberra to repair the previously strained relations.  Wang's remarks touch upon the sticking point between the two sides. Since last year, from accusing China of seeking political influence in Australia to pointing an accusing finger at China's cooperation with Pacific island countries under the Belt and Road Initiative, the previous Australian government under Malcolm Turnbull soured bilateral ties with a series of unfounded allegations.  The mistrust harbored by some Australians toward China was largely to blame for stoking the frictions between the two countries. Some Australian media outlets and politicians then sought to exploit this by stirring up anti-China sentiment in Australian society, which served to poison the atmosphere for bilateral ties.  Hence, it is good to see the new leadership in Canberra is showing a more open approach, and it is seeking to change course and steer bilateral ties out of the stormy waters in which they have been foundering.  Wang met with Payne at the latter's request on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, during which the two sides cleared the air with an in-depth exchange of views on China-Australia relations and issues of mutual interest.  Thus Payne's ongoing visit to China has been widely viewed as signaling a rapprochement in China-Australia ties. With the meeting between the two countries' top diplomats on Thursday again said to be both candid and constructive, it shows both sides are sincere in seeking to put bilateral ties back on the right track.  Payne said her country welcomes China to expand investments in Australia, which is a positive message to the Chinese business circle, as Chinese investments in Australia have come under increasing scrutiny in Australia in recent years.  It is also a positive message for the region. China-Australia cooperation in economic and trade fields is not only the cornerstone of bilateral ties, but also beneficial for the wider region, including the Pacific islands, where Wang said the two countries can join hands as they have a shared interest in their growth and prosperity.  Indeed, the Southern Pacific is big enough for China-Australia cooperation, and there is no need for Australia to feel threatened by China's normal interaction with the region.         "
"China, US should seize chance to resolve dispute: China Daily editorial",11/8/2018,"                      Relations between China and the United States are widely believed to be the most consequential of bilateral ties, so there has been growing concern as their interplay has become seemingly ever more intractable this year.  Thus recent indications the two sides want to rein in their frictions have been met with huge sighs of relief.  In the latest move, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and US National Security Advisor John Bolton met in Washington on Wednesday, and the two sides agreed to ""strengthen communication and cooperation"", and work together to ensure that the talks between the two countries' top leaders go well when they meet on the sidelines of this month's G20 summit in Argentina.  This adds to the momentum of the rapprochement that has gained steam since the two countries' leaders had a telephone conversation on Nov 1, in which they agreed that negotiations are the only way to realize mutually acceptable resolution to their trade dispute and these were ""moving along nicely"".  The two sides' shared desire to manage their differences has since been demonstrated by the resumption of the second China-US Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which is to be co-chaired by Yang and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Friday.  All this has raised hopes the two sides will be able to find a way to resolve their trade dispute and put their relations on firmer footing.  While it is natural the two sides should have differences of opinion, what’s important is Beijing and Washington remain cool-headed and listen to each other's concerns. Neither will achieve its goals if they are at loggerheads, and any fractiousness will prove to be self-harming.  Instead of becoming mired in unnecessary competition, they should appreciate that with the digital economy set to take off, there is huge potential to be tapped and greater rewards forthcoming if they view each other as partners rather than rivals.  Both countries should strive to have an accurate judgement of the other's strategic intentions, and maintain an atmosphere conducive to friendly exchanges of views, so that they can find a way to resolve their differences.  If progress can be made ahead of the G20 summit, then the two leaders will be able to give good tidings for a better year ahead.         "
China Daily editorial: Will polarized Congress widen or narrow divisions?,11/7/2018,"                          US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is introduced on stage by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Chairman Ben Ray Lujan as they react to the results of the US midterm elections at a Democratic election night rally in Washington, US Nov 6, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   In an illustration of the old saying ""extremes meet"", the Democratic Party took control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections but lost ground in the Senate.  The results gave both parties reason to celebrate; so now comes the tug of war. But while it may seem counterintuitive, the results mean the political system in the United States may regain some equilibrium.  That partly explains why majority opinion has it that the results of Tuesday's US midterm elections will have limited impact on US and global markets. Most analysts believe the deeper political polarization in Washington is likely to produce less polarizing outcomes as the US president will now have to focus on less divisive legislation.  He may also have other things to think about if the Democrat-controlled House decides it would like to have a closer look at his tax return and alleged links with the Kremlin.  However, the Democrats' greatest leverage, as some have observed, will be the ""checks and balances"" the House can impose on the White House.  Yet while the divided Congress may mean things become a little less extreme in certain respects, that doesn't mean they will become less uncertain.  It is to be hoped that the trade disputes do not become a political football in Washington. Following the phone conversation between the US and Chinese leaders and their agreement that the trade dispute that has flared up between the two countries can be resolved through talks, it would be an unwelcome setback if that positive momentum was now stalled or reversed.  The voting also made evident the divisions in US society have widened further, with the profile of the Republican Party becoming more rural and conservative and the Democratic Party more urban and liberal. These divisions are stark and at times deadly as shown by the deadly synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in the run-up to the elections.  If one of the results of the midterms is to temper the use of the racially-charged rhetoric that is becoming a defining feature of this administration, it would be a welcome development, as it may help people from all walks of life in the US appreciate they are part of a wider human society. And that would be a step toward finding solutions to many pressing problems.         "
Digital future compels more cooperation in cyberspace: China Daily editorial,11/7/2018,"                          A staff member plays rock-paper-scissors with an interactive 5G robot at the China Telecom stand at the Light of the Internet Exposition during the fifth World Internet Conference in the river town of Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, Nov 6, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   With digital technology playing an increasingly important role in the integration of the globalized world, joint endeavors for governance of the internet are necessary to ensure that all countries benefit from it.  This is why President Xi Jinping in his congratulatory message to the Fifth World Internet Conference, which opened on Wednesday in Wuzhen, East China's Zhejiang province, expressed his hope that all countries will deepen their pragmatic cooperation to inject vitality into efforts to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace.  He said that despite having different conditions and facing various challenges, countries need to work together to promote the digital economy, address cybersecurity challenges and meet the demand for better governance in cyberspace.  The rapid development of the internet has fundamentally changed the way people lead their lives, and its continued development with the establishing of the internet of things and the growing use of artificial intelligence promises further revolutionary changes to come.  For the world economy is on the cusp of another turning point as the introduction of 5G technology will enable the connection and interaction of billions of devices of almost any kind, which will have an impact on every aspect of daily life.  Spurred by this, the potential of the digital economy is enormous. China's digital economy, which is the largest in the world was 27.2 trillion yuan ($3.9 trillion) last year, accounting for 32.9 percent of its GDP. Boston Consulting Group expects China's digital economy to grow to $16 trillion by 2035, leading a trend whereby the digital economy will become simply the economy.  But as they accelerate the development of the digital economy it is necessary for countries to work together to ensure that the global internet governance system keeps pace with it to ensure that the coming wave of digital globalization is inclusive and no countries or people are left behind or excluded.  Likewise, countries must join hands to strengthen global cybersecurity. As the WannaCry ransomware attack showed last year, the pervasiveness of the internet is also potentially its Achilles' heel. Any defenses are only as strong as the weakest point, so countries need to realize that a secure internet is a shared responsibility.  With the principles of respecting internet sovereignty, safeguarding peace and security, promoting inclusive cooperation and establishing sound order, which was proposed by President Xi at the Second World Internet Conference in 2015, the current conference will hopefully get more technology companies and more countries working together to establish a framework for the better governance of the digital world for the benefit of all.

Canberra can reboot ties by showing fresh mindset: China Daily editorial,11/6/2018,"                          Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne. [Photo/Agencies]   Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne's visit to China, which starts on Wednesday, is clearly a positive move taken by the two sides to reset bilateral ties. With a new government taking office in Canberra in August, the two countries are now in a better position to mend broken fences and recalibrate their cooperation.  Payne's visit, the first official Australian ministerial visit in 18 months, will help defuse the lingering suspicion and anxiety that have stalled high-level contacts.  Although the two sides have had brief exchanges when their diplomats met on multilateral platforms in recent months, there is no denying the fact that relations between the two countries have remained strained since last year.  But since August, members of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government have made positive remarks about China, showing a willingness to make a departure from the much criticized China policy adhered to by the previous administration. In a policy speech last week, Morrison described Australia's economic relationship with China as ""vitally important"".  Against such a backdrop, the resumption of high-level China-Australia contacts is only natural. China has repeatedly said there is no fundamental difference between the two countries and Australia needs to discard the Cold War mentality which views China as an adversary, rather than a cooperative partner. This attitude was once again on display with the recent allegations that Huawei and ZTE would compromise the security of Australia's 5G network if involved.  There are undoubtedly differences between the two sides on a number of issues, most pertinently those that China regards as touching on its core interests.  The two sides need to create a cordial atmosphere to break the ice and build more mutual trust so that bilateral cooperation can be expanded and bring more benefits to both countries.  By demonstrating a fresh mindset and looking to the larger picture of China-Australia ties, the Morrison government can rebuild relations with China. Today, most Australians would not deny their country owes much to China for their country's economic prosperity over the past years.  That a delegation of 150 Australian exporters is in Shanghai this week attending the China International Import Expo reinforces that fact, and offers just one example of how China's further opening-up can provide new opportunities for Australia.

Security talks opportunity to set right tone for ties: China Daily editorial,11/6/2018,"                      It is good news to all concerned about the state of China-US relations that their second Diplomatic and Security Dialogue will finally be held on Friday in Washington. Although it remains to be seen how far the meeting can go in arresting the slide of bilateral ties amid the current trade impasse, that it is being held at all indicates they have a shared willingness to exert some control over the situation. There has been a growing conviction that recent US moves regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea are meant to extract more Chinese concessions on trade. Whether or not that is the case, Beijing and Washington need in-depth communication over security and diplomacy in general, to improve their ""trust deficit"". That deficit has been augmented considerably in the past few years, particularly after Washington openly identified Beijing as its foremost strategic competitor, President Donald Trump threatened a full-scale trade war, and State Secretary Mike Pompeo vowed to confront Beijing on all fronts. So it is particularly important for diplomatic and military authorities on both sides to engage in candid talks. They need to assure each other that the worst-case scenarios can be avoided and that agreements can be reached. Since it is economic and trade issues that are the most divisive at present, Friday's talks focusing on diplomacy and security, may not suffice for a similar assessment to the first such dialogue in June 2017, which was deemed to be significant progress in bilateral exchanges. Yet the coming discussions should not be lightly dismissed as given the latest messages from both capitals, both sides do want something other than confrontation. In a clear push back against the recent assumption that trade was no longer playing its role as the ""ballast"" of China-US ties, Vice-President Wang Qishan stated on Tuesday that, ""Trade and economic cooperation remain the anchor and propeller of a steady and healthy China-US relationship which is in essence mutually beneficial"", and he promised China would ""work for mutual benefit"". With US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis telling his Chinese counterpart earlier in Singapore that ""strategic competition does not imply hostility"", when the two meet again on Friday, they should demonstrate that both countries have the common political will to forge a healthy relationship. Doing so will surely be conducive to the two sides finding a solution to their trade frictions through talks and preventing their differences from becoming hostility.         "
Drill will intensify mistrust between Russia and NATO,11/6/2018,"                      [Photo/Agencies]   Despite being its largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, NATO has tried to downplay the war games it is holding just 200 kilometers from Russia's western border.  Trident Juncture, which is scheduled to last until Wednesday, involves some 50,000 military personnel from all 29 NATO members plus partners Finland and Sweden, as well as 65 ships, 250 aircraft and 10,000 vehicles in a scenario in which they are responding to a ""fictitious aggressor"".  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the goal is ""purely to prevent, not to provoke"". Russia, naturally, is less than enamored with NATO's show of force on its doorstep and it has voiced its displeasure, saying the exercises will not go unanswered. It has already announced plans for its own drills that include missile launches in areas overlapping those where the Western alliance forces are training. This has raised fears that an incident may occur, and both sides should exercise caution to avoid anything untoward happening.  The drill has once again highlighted the growing mistrust between Russia and members of the North American-European military alliance.  Despite NATO proclaiming it has made efforts to improve transparency and reduce misunderstanding-such as extending an invitation to Russia to send observers-it increasingly views Russia as a threat that must be addressed, especially after what the West describes as Russia's ""annexation"" of Crimea.  Moscow, on its part, has been alarmed by NATO's continuous expansion eastward to include the former Soviet Union's European satellite states as well as the military buildup by the alliance on its western flank. This has created a vicious cycle that has been driving an arms race-as shown by Washington's announcement that it intends to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty-that is a grave risk to world peace and security.  NATO claims that Trident Juncture is defensive in nature, but as military drills are staged as shows of might it will only aggravate the tensions that are becoming ever more acute between the West and Russia.  The fraught relations between the West and Russia will continue to worsen if they don't make efforts to resolve their differences and expand their common interests. NATO should act on its stated willingness to improve transparency, and Russia should respond in a like manner so as to reduce the possibility of a miscalculation that would only spark a new Cold War-or worse.

Globalization a trend that cannot be reversed,11/6/2018,"                      [Photo/Xinhua]   In his keynote speech to the opening ceremony of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on Monday, President Xi Jinping made it crystal clear that the world's second-largest economy stands firmly behind multilateralism and the free trade system.  China will not close its door to the world but instead will open it wider in the face of unilateralism and protectionism, he vowed.  Although the country does face challenges that need to be overcome, its development will not falter unless it closes its door to the outside world. Thus Xi's promise that China will further tap its potential for imports and continue to widen access to its market should further strengthen the world's confidence in the Chinese economy and its continued contributions to the global economy.  The reform and opening-up policies that China set in motion 40 years ago have definitely followed the trend of globalization, and they have helped China become what it is now. But it is also true to say that neither would the world economy be what it is now without globalization and China's opening-up.  Countries that have resorted to protectionism rather than the economic restructuring necessary to adjust to the changes wrought by the trend of globalization-which has been a rising tide for all economies if not all people-should accept that the practices of the law of jungle and winner takes all will only lead to a dead end.  Just as China will create fresh opportunities by sparing no effort to create a top level business environment, striving to create new heights for opening-up and further promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation, other economies also need to play their part by extending the space for mutual beneficial cooperation.  If the friction between free trade and protectionism can be compared to a tug of war in the world economy, the expo being held in Shanghai until Saturday is a strong pull for free trade.  Not just because it is the first state level expo of its kind ever held in the world, but also because it is a manifestation of the resolve of the world's second-largest economy to hold high the banner of multilateralism in pursuit of shared development.  Economic globalization is an irreversible trend. It undoubtedly needs to be made more inclusive, but no matter whether one likes it or not, one cannot stop it or reverse it.  Xi's speech shows China is committed to looking ahead and moving forward. Other countries should do the same and instead of clinging to the past turn their gaze toward a shared future.         "
Sanctions on Iran unlikely to get what White House wants,11/5/2018,"                      [Photo/Agencies]   As the US president indicated Saturday, he wants a deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Only he wants ""a new, more comprehensive"" one. One that suffices to not only freeze Iran's nuclear program, but also reduces that country's influence across the Middle East.  He seems confident that the full reinstatement of sanctions on Monday will achieve that, or he would not have posted a Game of Thrones-inspired poster, featuring himself, in the now-familiar chin-up determined-look pose, declaring ""sanctions are coming"".  That trademark confidence of his positive thinking has no doubt been bolstered by the success of pressuring Mexico and Canada into renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and transforming it into what is now the more White House acceptable United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  And particularly the outcome of the ""extreme pressure"" exerted on the Democratic Republic of Korea, which his administration seemingly expects will work similar magic on Teheran.  Yet Washington would be seriously miscalculating if it assumes the kind of deal it seeks will materialize easily. It is certainly not just because Teheran will not back off. Iran is a lot different from the DPRK, thanks to its greater capabilities, resources and influence in the region.  Despite Trump's animosity to the 2015 agreement, which he called ""defective at its core"", whose ""decaying and rotten structure""""cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb"", all the other signatories find it desirable and want to safeguard it.  China and Russia are firmly for it. And France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union have issued a joint statement, announcing they ""deeply regret"" Trump's decision, reiterating their continued commitment to the deal.  In spite of Washington's allegation that Teheran is violating the agreement, United Nations inspectors stand firmly by their conclusion that it is abiding by the agreement.  The conspicuous lack of international solidarity on this issue, combined with the moral weakness of the US argument, will no doubt undermine its ""extreme pressure"" tactic.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has demanded Teheran to withdraw from Syria, end its support to Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Huthi rebels in Yemen. Such demands have nothing to do with a nuclear agreement.  The world was united behind sanctions against Iran in 2012. But the Trump administration is trying to get others to help it get what it wants. Having made clear it is only acting in its own interests it is hypocritical to call on others to do the same.         "
Import expo a milestone for China's opening-up,11/5/2018,"                      Signs promoting the upcoming China International Import Expo at Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai on Oct 17, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The expos and fairs China has held at different times in history serve as milestones in its development journey.  The first export fair held in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in 1957, for instance, reflected China's pressing demand for foreign trade. Now known as the China Import and Export Fair, or Canton Fair, it is held every year in spring and autumn as a channel for the going out of made-in-China.  Now Shanghai is the venue for the first China International Import Expo, which opened on Monday. Reflecting that consumption has overtaken exports and investment as a growth driver-contributing over 60 percent of the economic growth in China-it is a channel for the world to come into China.  The event, which runs to Saturday, is being held when the country celebrates the 40th anniversary of its reform and opening-up, and reflects China's transformation from being the world's factory to being a market for the world.  China now has more than 300 million middle class consumers, and the number will double in a decade or two, which will be twice that of the United States, and threefold that of the European Union. Last year, China contributed 30 percent of the world's economic growth. That China increases imports to meet people's demands and propel its continued development-it expects to import more than $10 trillion worth of goods and services in five years-will benefit companies from around the world and help stoke the global economy.  More than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions are attending the expo, and more than 5,000 kinds of commodities will be exhibited for the first time in China, highlighting the benefits of economic globalization.  That many enterprises from countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road are taking part in the expo, with some from the least developed African countries showing their exports for free, also makes the event a window by which the world can see the world.  And by deepening China's interaction with the world, the expo will accelerate further reforms, most immediately in its intellectual property rights protection and financial sector.  History will tell that this expo was a milestone signaling that China was on the way to becoming the world's largest import and consumer market, and that countries around the world would share the dividends of China's continued reform and opening-up.

Upgraded online shopping can meet demands,11/3/2018,"                          [Photo by Zhai Haijun/China Daily]   With ""Double Eleven"" (or Nov 11) a week away, it would be good to know what young people expect from the annual online shopping gala.  In a recent China Youth Daily survey covering 1,969 respondents aged between 18 and 35, 68.1 percent said they value the price-performance ratio when shopping, while 58.3 percent said they would take into consideration the practicality and necessity of the goods they purchase, and 61.1 percent said they believe young people should purchase goods online to fulfill their real interests and for self-improvement.  Experts believe today's youths have a more rational approach to consumption, and the incorporation of knowledge and the fitness element into their daily lives has increasingly become a habit among them.  That young people attach more importance to the quality and price-performance ratio of the goods and services they purchase, and have a more mature consumption approach suggest they are nurturing ""higher-quality consumption"" as a result of China's qualitative economic development in recent years.  During the four decades of reform and opening-up, China's consumption has grown rapidly - for instance, total retail sales of social consumer goods increased from 155.86 billion yuan ($24.39 billion) in 1978 to 36.6 trillion yuan in 2017.  Once people's ""quantity"" demand for consumer goods is met, they tend to demand ""quality"" goods. This is true for consumption habits in any country.  No wonder an increasing number of young people in China are bidding adieu to indiscriminate ""one-click purchase"" on the internet. The rapid growth of non-living necessities in China's consumption market in recent years indicates people's consumption demands have become increasingly diversified. In general, people today attach more importance to quality products and seek more value experience from shopping. If the unrestrained online shopping in the past was a ""lower stage"" of consumption, then the current trend means the upgrading of consumption from quantity to quality.  Good quality and fast delivery of goods constitute the core of good online shopping experience. Many Chinese people like online shopping because the prices of goods online are lower compared with those in brick-and-mortar stores. But online shopping may not necessarily ensure the supply of quality goods. So, the guarantee of quality goods in online stores can give consumers a true and assured sense of gain.  If the price advantage in online shopping is offset by shoddy products, then the advantage could become a disadvantage. As consumers focus more on rational shopping and quality goods, it means that the consumption supply chain is being upgraded.  Given these facts, it is important to build a scientific and efficient quality control mechanism, introduce at-source quality management, and establish a set of mature basic service and after-sales service system, to address the rising diversified needs of consumers.  Some e-commerce platforms have been working hard to meet consumers' diversified demands for high-quality shopping. For example, JD.com, one of China's leading e-commerce giants, set up a special customer experience department this year to improve a series of services for consumers, from assured purchase and quick refund, to compensation for delayed delivery, replacement of old products with new ones through home calls, and other tailored after-sales services.  Fast delivery can bring consumers a sense of instant gratification, which is particularly important during big shopping events such as ""Double Eleven"" when there is a high probability of express delivery congestion. So it is of vital importance to have an independent and high-quality logistics platform. The business of providing comprehensive and integrated logistics solutions for the diversified demands of consumers and consumption scenarios, and of offering better quality services to consumers and merchants, is becoming a competitive area for major e-commerce platforms.  That young Chinese have become more mature means that during shopping galas such as ""Double Eleven"", every link in the demand and supply chain - from production and sales to delivery, after-sales services, technology upgrading and operation mode optimization - must be continuously strengthened to provide high-quality services for consumers. In other words, only when the online shopping supply chain is upgraded can it meet the needs of rational and high-quality consumption.  The article was first published in China Youth Daily.         "
Digital economy needs global governance,11/3/2018,"                      [Photo/VCG]   From the G20 and World Economic Forum to national development plans and think tank research reports, in recent years, the ""digital economy"" has become a buzzword and risen to the top of many countries' and businesses' agenda.  Increasingly, governments and businesses see the digital economy as a key driver of growth and are directing investments accordingly. In September, the National Development and Reform Commission signed an agreement with China Development Bank to offer 100 billion yuan ($14.55 billion) in financing over the next five years to support the digital push.  On Sept 20, China held its first International Digital Economy Expo in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, attracting high-profile companies and more than 100 business leaders from home and abroad.  At present, more than 22 percent of the global GDP is closely linked to the digital economy. By 2025, the digital economy is expected to drive about half of the global output growth. The digital economy has enabled the birth of new industries and business models, allowing companies and people to connect across borders, linking producers with consumers and workers with job opportunities. Digitization has had a transformative effect on all manner of industries.  Over the past decade, buoyed by its vast market and supportive policies, China has taken a leading position in digital industries. A Cyberspace Administration of China report in 2017 said China's digital economy grew to 27.2 trillion yuan, up 20.3 percent year-on-year, and accounted for 32.9 percent of its GDP.  This makes China's digital economy the second-largest in the world. China has the world's largest e-commerce market, accounting for 40 percent of the global total. It is also among the leading markets for virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, drones and artificial intelligence. Mobile payments, in particular, have caught on like wildfire in China, with the total annual transaction value being more than 10 times that of the US.  Promise and challenges of the digital economy  The digital economy has become an important engine for growth that is both sustainable and inclusive. It has helped to raise productivity in existing industries and given birth to new sectors, and integrated all aspects of business and society, helping to make our world more efficient and convenient while providing impetus and inspiration for socioeconomic development.  However, the rapid development of the digital economy has also presented us with new challenges. For example, a significant ""digital divide"" still exists within and between countries due to inequalities in access to infrastructure and digital literacy. This divide may prevent societies from harnessing the full benefits that digital technologies can deliver.  The growth of the digital economy has also been accompanied by increasing threats to safety and security. Experts estimate that cybercrime and hacking cause more than $400 billion of losses to the global economy every year. Recent events across the world have also shown how the same digital tools designed to link people from different corners of the globe can also be used to spread misinformation and prejudice.  But the development of governance models for this new digital sphere has lagged behind the rapid advances in technology. We have yet to achieve consensus on what should be regulated, how, and by whom, and there is a lack of common rules and standards on issues such as data ownership and privacy.  Solutions for a safer, more inclusive digital world  To balance the benefits and risks of the digital economy, we need more effective platforms and institutions to overcome the present governance deficit. As a leading digital economy, China has actively worked to promote suitable global governance mechanisms.  During China's presidency of the G20 in 2016, the digital economy was put high on the agenda for the first time. This culminated in members adopting the G20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou in 2016, the first policy document on the digital economy to be endorsed by G20 leaders. The G20 is well placed to build on this and help coordinate digital strategies, acting as a hub of global governance in this sphere.  There is also a need for new platforms to facilitate dialogue and coordination in the management of the digital economy, including ones that involve the non-governmental sector. In recognition of this, at the 2018 International Digital Economy Expo, the D50 Enterprise Digital Economy Summit was created, based on a joint proposal from the Center for China and Globalization and China Electronic Chamber of Commerce. The D50 aims to provide an international forum to enhance the role of nongovernmental actors in building a healthy and inclusive global digital economy.  Moving forward, we will need new ideas and ways of thinking to fully realize the great promise of the digital economy and ensure that all share its benefits.  First, we should accelerate building the necessary foundations of the digital ecosystem, expanding network infrastructure and promoting innovation of digital technologies and applications.  This calls for increased R&D in key sectors such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, and smart manufacturing. These efforts will nurture new industries and promote the digital upgrading of existing sectors, helping to integrate the digital and real economies. In turn, this will provide new vitality to the global economy.  Second, we should work to promote meaningful exchange via digital technologies. Interconnectedness is a fundamental characteristic of the digital economy and its proliferation. Therefore, decision-makers, entrepreneurs, and social actors should work to build shared digital spaces that bring people from all nations and walks of life together.  Fruits of new economy should be shared by all  Third, it is important that we ensure that the fruits of the digital economy are shared by all. The growth of the digital economy can produce wealth but also causes some people to lose out as existing industries and ways of life are disrupted.  So governments, businesses, and social organizations should find solutions to help overcome the digital divide, providing not only physical access to key infrastructure but also cultivating the social conditions and skills necessary for people to participate in the digital economy.  It is also crucial that we increase cooperation on governance of the digital economy. Countries should be allowed to follow a path of digital development that is suitable to their own national conditions and be able to participate in internet governance on an equal footing. Only by working together can countries prevent cybercrime and build a safe and healthy environment for the growth of the digital economy.  To establish long-lasting peace and prosperity in this interconnected world, we should continue to strive for win-win partnerships and ever-deeper cooperation to ensure the healthy development of the digital economy.

Why are Sino-US ties 'the most consequential'?,11/3/2018,"                      [Photo/IC]   When John Allen, president of the Brookings Institution, said the US-China relationship is ""the most consequential"" bilateral relationship of the 21st century in Washington on Tuesday, I realized he had said the same thing a few weeks before.  Allen didn't elaborate even this time, and he didn't need to. At least three public discussions were held on Tuesday in different venues blocks apart, and they all focused on China-US relations, from trade conflicts to long-term interests to myths the two peoples hold about each other. It's not surprising that so many events on a single day were devoted to reviewing the status quo and trends in the relations between the world's top two economies because they are locked in an escalating trade conflict and facing rising tensions on many other fronts.  But the takeaways from the discussions were interesting, which mostly favor de-escalation of the trade conflict, prefer cooperation to rivalry and seek to bridge the gaps that separate the two countries.  At a seminar organized by the Institute for China-America Studies on Tuesday morning, senior economists from the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank reviewed how the tit-for-tat trade measures by the two countries are already wreaking havoc on their economies, as well as the rest of the world.  The trade conflict the US administration triggered is going to cost at least 8.6 million jobs in China and 329,000 jobs in the United States in the worst-case scenario, Valerie Mercer-Blackman of the ADB said at the seminar.  Shanaka Jayanath Peiris from the IMF argued that the aggregate labor displacement would be limited, but some sectors such as textiles in China and agriculture in the US, could be hit hard. The East and Southeast Asia regions, whose supply chains are centered on China, are the most dynamic growth centers in the world today. A prolonged China-US trade conflict would undermine the confidence of investors and deter investment much beyond the regions, the Institute for China-America Studies said in a statement.  One of Tuesday's most important think tank events was the ""China Debate: Are US and Chinese long-term interests fundamentally incompatible?"" held at the Brookings in the afternoon. The team supporting the motion, led by Evan Medeiros, Penner Family Chair in Asian Studies at Georgetown University, argued that US-China interests are substantially and increasingly incompatible, with more divergence than convergence. Medeiros warned that ""continuing to deny that our interests are diverging more than converging is dangerous"" because he said that would ""embolden"" China to be more assertive in pursuing its multiple interests.  But Susan A. Thornton, former US acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, on the opposing team, said the trade conflict is manageable and that the two countries have many interests in common - either in countering instability and conflict in regional hotspots; fighting terrorism and extremism; or in promoting prosperity for both as well as other countries.  ""Maybe the most fundamental interest we have in common is the mutual desire to avoid conflict,"" said Thornton, now senior fellow at Paul Tsai China Center of Yale Law School. ""I would also argue that China is not a revisionist, that China sees itself as wanting to prolong and continue the existing international order, albeit with some changes.""  Before the nearly 90-minute debate, 35 percent of the audience voted that American and Chinese long-term interests are incompatible, while 50 percent disagreed, and 15 percent were undecided. ""After the debate, 53 percent disagreed,"" announced Evan Osnos, a nonresident fellow with the John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings.  The event on Tuesday evening - a panel discussion followed by the screening of the latest documentary on China-US relations - was a light one but shed light on serious issues, including whether Americans really understand China.  Five years in the making, the 90-minute film, Better Angels, directed by two-time Academy Award winner Malcolm Clarke, is an ode to ordinary men and women in the two countries who have put the relationship on a firm footing. In the words of co-producer William Mundell, the documentary highlights the wider benefits of US-China cooperation, the dark side of globalization for the Chinese, and the common humanity that drives China and the US together.  After watching the film, I agree with Mundell that by using the lens of ordinary Americans and Chinese to bridge the gaps separating them, the film will help shatter the myths that Americans have about China, and Chinese have about the US. And I understand all the more what Allen meant when he said Beijing and Washington comprise ""the most consequential bilateral relations of the 21st century"".

Sanctions backtrack shows US out of step with the world: China Daily editorial,11/1/2018,"                      In a surprise move, the United States has said that it will likely give waivers to some allies that rely on Iranian oil supplies. ""We want to achieve maximum pressure but we don't want to harm friends and allies either,"" US National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Wednesday. But the move also helps save face for the US just three days before the Nov 4 deadline the US set for international oil buyers to stop all their purchases from Iran. Washington had threatened it would punish any violators. But few if any countries, including its allies, had shown any willingness to comply with Washington's ultimatum. The abrupt change of mind by the US administration shows it has finally recognized its plan to cut down Iran's oil exports to ""zero"" — as part of its ""maximum pressure"" strategy to wring a new agreement out of Teheran after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal — was not going to work. Given its impracticality, such an ill-conceived policy was bound to fail. Because there is no viable substitute for Iran's current oil exports that amount to around 2.5 million barrels a day, the global crude market has already experienced big volatility due to the planned US sanctions. This has brought unnecessary uncertainties to the world economy that is still struggling to recover. For the US sanction plan to work, it would have required endorsement and cooperation from all major players in the international arena. Yet so far three of Iran's five largest buyers — China, India and Turkey — have rejected US requests to end their oil purchase, not only out of consideration for their own economic interests, but also to say no to the US trying to use its domestic law to impose its will upon others. European countries were even considering implementing a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle — similar to a barter system to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands — to bypass the proposed US sanctions. All this suggests that the Donald Trump administration's pressure campaign against Iran does not have the backing of the rest of the international community. Washington should really consider a change of approach and uphold the negotiated settlement on the Iran nuclear issue, as its hostile stance toward Iran is achieving little except to raise questions about how capable the current US administration is of continuing to claim US global leadership.         "
Nonpublic sector still indispensable: China Daily editorial,11/1/2018,"                      Some recent irresponsible comments suggesting it is time for the nonpublic sector to be incorporated into the public economy have understandably spooked private entrepreneurs.  But there is no reason for them to be concerned, as the top leadership has made clear that the country will continue to support the nonpublic economy.  There is no doubt that private enterprises have been feeling the pain due to the country's ongoing economic restructuring and the US onslaught on the Chinese economy. But speaking at a meeting with private entrepreneurs on Thursday, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, pledged that the country will help the private economy with tax cuts and financing facilitation policies. And he reiterated that the property of private entrepreneurs will be protected.  Private enterprises - which are active in most of the country's economic sectors, and account for the bulk of the country's growth, taxation and employment - have played an indispensable role in China's development, he said.  This was consistent with Xi's remarks in the report he delivered to the 19th National Congress of the CPC in October last year, when he said that the government should promote the healthy growth of the nonpublic sector of the economy, and encourage those working in this sector to achieve success.  Likewise, China's Constitution stipulates that the nonpublic sectors of the economy such as the individual and private sectors are an ""important component"" of the country's overall economic system, and the State has the duty to protect the lawful rights and interests of individuals and private enterprises.  This was affirmed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at its meeting on Wednesday to analyze the economic situation, when it said that the development of enterprises of all types of ownership will be resolutely supported, and it is looking at ways to help private enterprises tackle the challenges they are facing.  It is not the first time that the Chinese economy and its private enterprises have faced harsh challenges in the reform and opening-up era. But each time the difficulties have been overcome. There is no reason to think that will not be the case this time despite the concatenation of circumstances.  The indexes show China's economic fundamentals remain sound, and the Chinese economy remains one of the most dynamic.  But to give a shot in the arm to the nonpublic sectors and bolster the confidence of entrepreneurs, the authorities should accelerate the supportive measures pledged by Xi and continue to be proactive in improving the business environment for private enterprises.

Ideological bias keeping Australia mired in the past: China Daily editorial,10/31/2018,"                      Suspicion, mistrust and hostility are the messages that China continues to receive from Australia. Admittedly this could be a legacy of the poisonous atmosphere which was fostered by the previous administration of prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. But the longer this climate of prejudice persists, the more it will erode the basis for ties between the two countries. The latest Australian accusations are once again targeted at Chinese telecommunications companies doing business in Australia and normal academic exchanges with Australian institutes. Critical infrastructure such as electricity grids, water supplies and hospitals could not be adequately safeguarded if Chinese-owned telecommunications giants were involved in Australia's new 5G network, claimed Mike Burgess, the director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate in a speech in Canberra on Monday. While he did not mention them by name, Huawei and ZTE are the two vendors he called high risk. Both of the enterprises have been smeared in this way before. And in another development that will aggravate the simmering frictions between the two countries, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute claimed that some Chinese scientists hide their military backgrounds to work on sensitive research programs, such as navigation and missile technology, at Australian universities. Clearly, these wild and unsupported accusations have their roots in concern about China's development and the eagerness of Canberra to keep Washington sweet by backing the US administration in its bid to curb China's technological progress. Particularly in 5G, which is regarded as the future economic high ground, and one where Washington is desperate to plant the flag. Fortunately, not all Australians share that concern or objective. The state of Victoria, undaunted by the cold shoulder still being shown to China, has decided to trust its own judgment and has just signed up to participate in China's Belt and Road Initiative. Also the China Institute with the University of Technology Sydney said in a report on Monday that playing up a China threat does not conform to Australia's interests. Even some members of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government have made favorable remarks on developing ties with China since taking office in August, so bilateral relations are not entirely shrouded in doom and gloom. But for this desirable upside to gather momentum, more people in Australia need to appreciate that China's continued development is an opportunity, not a threat. Discriminatory measures based on manufactured excuses are the product of a lingering ideological bias that is long past its sell-by date. Canberra should follow Victoria's lead and embrace the cooperative trend of the times.         "
"Jin Yong's heroes will live on imparting their values, spirit: China Daily editorial",10/31/2018,"                          File photo of Louis Cha, better known by his pen name Jin Yong. [Photo provided To China Daily]   A modern Chinese literary giant left us on Tuesday. Louis Cha Leung-yung, better known by his pen name Jin Yong, was one of the greatest modern authors of Chinese fiction and revered by fans around the world as the father of the many of the kung fu heroes that they have come to love.  Through his timeless portrayals of various heroes in dynastic China's wuxia, or martial arts, world — and their depiction in many popular movies, TV and radio series, video games and comic books — he became a household name among Chinese. It has been said he is the world's most read Chinese author, and certainly his books have taught generations of readers about the importance of values, such as compassion, honesty, perseverance, righteousness and patriotism.  Some people say his passing marks the end of an era in Chinese martial arts fiction, but countless more believe the heroes he created will live forever.  A journalist by trade in the early years of his literary career, Cha became deputy editor of New Evening Post in Hong Kong, where he met Chen Wentong, who wrote wuxia novels under the pseudonym Liang Yusheng. With Chen's encouragement, Cha began work on his first serialized martial arts novel The Book and the Sword in 1955. It was an instant hit.  Cha went on to write 14 more wuxia novels and distinguished himself in the relatively small circle of Chinese martial arts writers with an unmatched penchant for realism in his period settings. His style of storytelling incorporated fictional characters and plots with historical figures and events. That is what makes the stories resonate so much more than other works of this genre, along with the fact that the characters he created are so relatable to readers regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, education and life experience.  All the memorable characters in his martial arts hero novels, from great kung fu masters to accidental disciples of the Art of War, no matter how intelligent and strong they appear, are flawed in some way and make mistakes every now and then, just like all of us in real life.  Ultimately what makes someone a hero in his works is that they have the will and capability to make decisions and do things that serve the best interest of their communities when it matters. Something Cha did in his own way, not only through his novels, but also in the editorials he wrote for the Hong Kong daily newspaper Ming Pao, which he co-founded in 1959.         "
"Beijing, Manila fly the flag for peaceful waters: China Daily editorial",10/30/2018,"                      State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to the Philippines this week underlines the great importance China attaches to its neighborhood diplomacy. It is another sign of China's commitment to deepening ties with countries in Southeast Asia and working with them to build a shared future. Wang's talks with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his Philippine Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin Jr have touched upon a wide range of issues from deepening bilateral cooperation to jointly defending multilateralism and maintaining peace in the South China Sea. Indeed, in a little more than two years, Beijing and Manila have made great strides in cooperation. Each time high-ranking officials from the two countries have met, they have focused on how to expand their fields of cooperation and deepen mutual trust. Wang's visit this time is no exception, as it aims to consolidate the basis for further improvement in bilateral relations, so as to bring more benefits to both countries. In Manila, Wang made a high evaluation on the two countries' efforts to properly handle their differences and the useful experience both sides have accumulated in setting aside their territorial dispute so that bilateral ties can flourish. By looking to the larger picture of nation-to-nation ties and regional peace and stability, the two sides have set a good example for other countries in the region. Their rapprochement has not only contributed to ratcheting down tensions in the South China Sea, it has also helped build the current desirable momentum in the negotiations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea. But while these negotiations are in progress, the countries concerned will have to be aware of attempts by some from outside the region to hinder their efforts. Some countries, of which the United States is the ring-leader, do not want to see China and the members of ASEAN working together for the good of the region, and they continue to try and make waves in the region. Their disruptive behavior was once again on display during Wang's visit to the Philippines as the US navy provoked a close encounter with a Chinese destroyer. This is part of their blame game in which China has been given the role of the baddie. China and ASEAN countries should remain alert to this ill trend to ensure it does not delay or derail the finalizing of a code of conduct for the South China Sea.         "
Only realistic way to strike a 'great deal' is by talking: China Daily editorial,10/30/2018,"                      Trump said on Monday he expects a ""great deal"" with China on trade. This is a change; previously he seemed to expect a great deal from China.  With the fallout from the ongoing US-China trade spat spilling beyond the world's two largest economies, there has been a growing desire for a meeting between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump, in the expectation that a face-to-face meeting would de-escalate tensions, given the ""great chemistry"" that Trump has previously touted between them.  Thus, Trump's remark has fueled anticipation that the two leaders will take the opportunity to hold one-on-one talks on the sidelines of at the G20 Leaders Summit in Argentina at the end of November to find a way to at least ease, if not end, the current confrontation.  It would be their first meeting since the trade frictions started, and hopes are high that the two leaders' personal rapport would be able to reboot relations, which have been hacked by the United States' insecurities in the face of the trend toward a greater balance in the arrangement of global power.  Yet it would be hasty to read too much into Trump's optimism, especially as it was accompanied by a threat of more tariffs.  Given that the US Commerce Department also announced it had removed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit from its list of suppliers on Monday, alleging the Chinese company stole intellectual property from US semiconductor company Micron Technology, it seems unlikely there has been any change of heart by the US administration.  The Chinese company is reportedly at the heart of Made in China 2025, a program to develop new high-technology industries that the Trump administration has specifically targeted to stop China gaining in advantage in the industries of the future.  Should they have a meeting in Argentina, Xi could explain how the plan envisions China's future development, and how it will advance further reform and opening-up, creating new opportunities from which the US can benefit.  Although it is a trait of Washington to expect immediate gains, it should bear in mind that the remarkable transformation of China from a planned economy to the thriving market it is today has taken 40 years of vision, hard work and trial and error. It is unrealistic and unreasonable for the Trump administration to expect the latest measures to bring instant gratification.  The prospects of a deal remain slim while the US administration refuses to listen to reason, and persists on viewing trade as a zero-sum game. Trump could achieve a great deal by rejecting that outdated view.         "
No reason for 'Tropical Trump' to disrupt relations with China: China Daily editorial,10/29/2018,"                          Jair Bolsonaro waves to supporters during the second round of the presidential elections, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Oct 28, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   With Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilian president-elect, pledging radical changes to both the country's domestic and foreign policies, there has been some speculation about the prospects for China-Brazil relations.  And not only Chinese businesses operating in Brazil, but also the authorities in Beijing, will be asking: To what extent will the next leader of Latin America's biggest country disrupt the China-Brazil relationship?  It is a pertinent question. After all, Bolsonaro is portrayed by some as a ""Tropical Trump"", a right-winger who not only endorses United States President Donald Trump's nationalist agenda, but may actually copy a page from the latter's playbook. He has pledged to shun multilateral international institutions in favor of bilateral arrangements, and he has vowed to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.   Also, Bolsonaro sounded less than friendly to China on the campaign trail. He portrayed China as a predator looking to dominate key sectors of the Brazilian economy.   It is thus not surprising that people are wondering whether Bolsonaro will, as the US president has, deal a substantial blow to the otherwise thriving and mutually beneficial China-Brazil relationship.   We are not true believers of the popular assumption that promises made on the campaign trail are just for the campaign trail. Or that Bolsonaro the president will naturally eat the most extreme words of Bolsonaro the candidate.   Still, we cherish the sincere hope that when he assumes leadership of the world's eighth-largest economy, Bolsonaro will take an objective and rational look at the state of China-Brazil relations.  Because then he would be aware that China is his country's largest export market, and No 1 source of trade surplus. More important, the two economies are truly mutually complementary, and hardly competitors.   Bulk Brazilian supplies, most noticeably grain and minerals, have not only helped fuel China's rapid growth, but also supported the rapid growth of Brazil. Dumping China, whom Bolsonaro once described as an exceptional partner, may serve some specific political purpose. But the economic cost can be backbreaking for the Brazilian economy, which has just emerged from its worst recession in history.   While Bolsonaro may have emulated the US president in being outspoken and outrageous to capture the imagination of voters, there is no reason for him to copy Trump's trade policies — as many of his supporters have pointed out.

Expo a vote of confidence in open global economy: China Daily editorial,10/29/2018,"                          Signs promoting the upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) are seen at Lujiazui financial district in Pudong, Shanghai, on Oct 17, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   It might be the worst of times for China's economy given the rise of unilateralism and protectionism as represented by the United States, in particular, erecting trade barriers against its trade partners, including imposing hefty tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods.  Yet it could also be the best of times for China's deepening reform and opening-up, for in the face of adversity the country's resolve to promote free trade and open its market wider has never been stronger.  The country's growth over the past four decades is a success story which proves that only through opening-up and full economic engagement with the rest of the world can the country prosper.  Thus those attending the first China International Import Expo will find that China's pursuit of opening-up in greater breadth and depth will bring immense opportunities for them.  To be held from Nov 5 to 10 in Shanghai, the expo will serve as platform to strengthen cooperation in international free trade and act as a confidence booster for economic globalization and a counterstrike against protectionism.  China has said it will import products and services with a value of over $10 trillion over the next five years, and the expo has attracted more than 3,000 companies from over 130 countries and regions keen to take advantage of the opportunities it presents.  Despite the challenges it faces, China remains the world's largest and most vibrant consumer market with limitless potential. Foreign direct investment surged over 6 percent in the first eight months of the year. That explains why most of China's trade partners except the United States, which is having a bit of a hissy fit at the moment, have decided to send high-profile delegations to the expo.  That President Xi Jinping will attend the opening ceremony and deliver a keynote speech before visiting the pavilions of different countries with foreign leaders — as disclosed at a news conference on Monday — reflects that this is an initiative from the top that will ""hold the banner of opening-up and reform even higher"".  China has promised to cut import tariffs for more than 1,500 industrial goods starting in November, which will bring the overall tariff rate down to 7.5 percent, a lower-middle level by international standards. It also plans to further open up its financial services sector after lifting curbs on foreign ownership of auto producers.  As such, the US is simply cutting off its nose to spite its face to prove a point that China is already in the process of addressing.         "
US-China competition can avoid confrontation: China Daily editorial,10/28/2018,"                          Beijing has continually sought to defuse the tensions and avert the new Cold War that many are predicting. [Photo/IC]   In announcing he will meet with his Chinese counterpart this week, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said competition does not necessarily mean hostility. That statement deserves heeding by some of his colleagues in the Donald Trump administration.  There is a rough consensus in Beijing that the present turn in US China strategy is not entirely of the US president's making. But that does not alter the fact that Trump seems willing to see how the scheme that his strategists have come up with plays out.  In a flip to the ping-pong diplomacy that aimed to isolate the former Soviet Union, Washington has not only labeled China as the foremost rival of the US, it is also seeking to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow.  Just last week, US National Security Advisor John Bolton reportedly claimed Chinese missiles threaten the ""Russian heartland"", and called for talks with Russia about Chinese activities.  It is part of the bid by the US administration to alienate China from those countries that have friendly relationships with it, a tactic that is now in full swing.  On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a swipe at the Belt and Road Initiative, accusing China of using it to build a ""treasury-run empire"" by bribing foreign leaders ""in exchange for infrastructure projects that will harm the people of that nation"".  That was not the first time the top US diplomat has gone on the offensive in this way. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, he cautioned against Chinese investments. He is now leading a US government project to counteract the ""Belt and Road"" by mobilizing private-sector investments.  These, and the scurrilous speech by Vice-President Mike Pence earlier this month, show that the Donald Trump administration is doubling down on their assault on the Chinese economy. Indeed the rising frictions between the two countries have raised concerns that the trade frictions may be merely the precursor to a broader confrontation.  Beijing has continually sought to defuse the tensions and avert the new Cold War that many are predicting. With almost every statement of resolve to counter US threats, Beijing has simultaneously indicated willingness to negotiate.  Although Washington has shown no reciprocal inclination to talk, Beijing’s portrayal of bilateral trade as being beneficial to both countries is accurate. Its appeal for crisis management is also sincere.  Washington should be sensible about the competition between the two countries, which is unavoidable in more and more fields in the global context. It should accept the emerging reality and adapt to it. This may be the only way to prevent the competition from becoming antagonistic.         "
Neighbors show their shared resolve to keep ties on track: China Daily editorial,10/26/2018,"                          Premier Li Keqiang holds a welcome ceremony for visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People, Beijing, Oct 26. [Photo/Xinhua]   Confucius, China's ancient philosopher, said that at the age of 40, one shall have no more doubts.  Forty years ago, China and Japan, whose cultures have both been deeply influenced by Confucian thought, concluded their Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which came into effect on Oct 23, 1978. Since then, the treaty has served as the ballast that has enabled the two neighbors to right the ship of their relations whenever stormy waters have threatened to sink it.  On Thursday evening, Premier Li Keqiang and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrated the 40th anniversary of the treaty and expressed their shared confidence the two countries are still on the right course and they will continue to adhere to the guiding principles of the treaty.  That many agreements, including 500 business deals worth $18 billion were signed at their second meeting on Friday, highlights the bright future for their relations if the two neighbors can manage their differences and problems constructively.  In the long river of history, 40 years is just a fleeting moment. But even so, that short span of years has not been smooth sailing for two neighbors. And despite the current good momentum there can be no denying that thorny issues still exist.  But they have shown they are willing to make concerted efforts to build on what they have achieved over the past four decades and properly manage their differences, which will help them forge greater political mutual trust.  The two sides' joint pledge to uphold the bilateral agreement of friendship and stand together in the face of the changing realities in both regional and international arenas is a welcome step in this regard.  Abe's visit is a milestone in the recent upturn in ties. To move forward, the two countries now need to work together to converge their interests and deepen cooperation so that they do not repeatedly need to break the ice.  Later on Friday when meeting Abe, President Xi Jinping said relations were now back on the right track. By fostering more pragmatic cooperation and expanding their common interests, the two countries cannot only boost that good momentum but also work together for the good of the region.  For as two major economies and two important players in regional and international platforms, Beijing and Tokyo can play a significant role in building peace and stability in Northeast Asia and drive forward economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.  And in reaffirming their commitment to peace and friendship, China and Japan have signaled to the world that they will stand together and strive to take to a new level a free and fair trading system.

World will benefit as China opens wider: China Daily editorial,10/26/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, talks with heads of middle and small-sized private enterprises at an automotive equipment company in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, during an inspection tour, Oct 24, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   The visit by Xi Jinping to Guangdong province in December 2012, immediately after he was elected general secretary of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee, signaled the new leadership's resolve to carry on reform and opening-up. Standing in front of Deng Xiaoping's statue in Shenzhen, one of the country's first special economic zones whose trailblazing efforts were supported by Deng, he said the country must have the courage to continue on this path.  This week, President Xi inspected Guangdong again, saying that its development over the past four decades proved that reform and opening-up are the way forward, and the country will unswervingly and unremittingly deepen reform and expand opening-up following the blueprint the Party has charted.  If Deng's endorsement of reform and opening-up unveiled China to the world, Xi's wholehearted endorsement of it as the right path for the country is of both national and international significance.  As protectionism and isolationism have reared their ugly heads, Xi's pledge that the world's second-largest economy will deliver a bigger miracle by being more open, innovative and cooperative, should give a big boost to confidence in the future of economic globalization.  Under Xi's leadership, China has demonstrated its potential — it has not only maintained a robust and stable growth at home while upgrading its economy and improving its governance and environment, but also supplied public goods and wisdom to the world through win-win cooperation based on mutual respect and equality.  By displaying reason, restraint and foresight when dealing with thorny issues, the country has earned credit and trust to act as a reformative power to make global governance fairer and more just.  His call for reform and opening-up to be carried out at a higher level and with higher goals has made clear the Party's determination to make breakthroughs in the deep waters of reform. This should dispel concerns about the prospects of the Chinese economy that were evident in debates on the role of private enterprises and the belated, if not long overdue, financial reform.  The country now has a solid foundation and greater space for maneuver; and it is time to finally say goodbye to the quantity-oriented model of development and usher in quality, sustainable and inclusive growth.  The objective of reform and opening-up is no longer to revitalize the economy and society as it was 40 years ago, but national rejuvenation and building China into a modern socialist power.  Over the past 40 years, reform and opening-up have transformed China and benefited the world, Xi's tour of Guangdong made clear that China will not stray from this path.         "
Clinging to outdated mindset will not guarantee security: China Daily editorial,10/25/2018,"                      The latest manufactured angst in the United States about the president's phone habits is yet another demonstration of the zero-sum Cold War mentality that still grips Washington. This is at odds with the view expressed by President Xi Jinping in his congratulatory letter to the eighth Beijing Xiangshan Forum, a high-profile platform facilitating security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific, which opened in Beijing on Thursday. Peace, development and win-win cooperation are the trends of today's world, and the future of people around the world is closely connected, he wrote. It is a view encapsulated in his proposal that countries work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. A community based on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. The forum, which Xi praised for playing a positive role in promoting security dialogue, mutual trust and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region since its launch eight years ago, is part of China's continuous endeavors to deepen global mutual trust, build consensus, mitigate suspicion and expand cooperation. Beijing has been steadfast in calling on countries to join hands to build a peaceful and stable security environment conducive to the pursuit of common development. This year, the theme for the forum is ""Building a New Type of Security Partnership of Equality, Mutual Trust and Win-Win Cooperation"". This offers an inspiring alternative to the self-interest and unilateralism that is being promote at present by some countries and encapsulates the trend of the times. Those denying the validity of agreements and global institutions are seeking to destroy the underpinnings of global stability that support the trend for multilateral cooperation. Agreements such as the deal on climate change reached in Paris and the Iran nuclear deal were achievements made through difficult negotiations. But although hard-won, they were reached. In his letter, Xi called on participants at the forum to pool their wisdom and work to realize a brighter future for mankind by building momentum for a new type of international relations that reject the zero-sum mentality in favor of all being winners. The practice of seeking exclusive security at the expense of others' legitimate interests and concerns is no longer desirable, or indeed tolerable. Those clinging to the ways of the past will be left behind by history.         "
Stock market volatility sign that Washington off course: China Daily editorial,10/25/2018,"                          Numbers are displayed at the closing bell of the Dow Industrial Average at the New York Stock Exchange on October 24, 2018 in New York. [Photo/VCG]   US stocks closed sharply lower on Wednesday, with major indices posting slumps of at least 2 percent, triggering widespread sell-offs in other parts of the world.  While analysts said the mixed corporate earnings performances and other factors, such as geopolitical tensions, are behind the nosedive, there was general agreement that the dampened sentiment was the fallout from the ongoing trade disputes the United States has initiated with its major trade partners.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 percent, or more than 600 points while the Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 4.4 percent, its worst day since 2011. The US stock indices have obviously trended down this month after climbing to almost 27,000, making analysts predict worse to come.  Admittedly, technical factors can partially explain the recent losses in the US stock market. The US stock indices have risen uninterruptedly for nearly 10 years and with their stock prices soaring, US companies' price-earnings ratios have risen to very high levels. Moreover, economists are widely expecting the world's largest economy to start weakening from next year or 2020.  A major stock market correction would therefore not be surprising.  Still, that should not negate the fact that investors have expressed their concerns over the uncertainties caused by the trade confrontations resulting from the hard-line trade policies of the US government.  These echo those of the US Federal Reserve, which admitted in a report that firms nationwide are worried about the serious impact of the US administration's tariff policies.  This was in line with an earlier IMF report that stated the trade conflicts among major players would be a drag on global trade activities and economic growth, and threatened to fracture global supply chains.  The recent deep corrections in the US stock indices show that investors are in agreement that Washington's stance is jeopardizing the global trade system.  The stock market falls should serve as a signal to Washington that if the global economy as a whole worsens, the US economy will not go unscathed and its beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy will only backfire.  Instead of sticking to their adventurist game, US policymakers should reassess their trade strategy, and adopt a more reasonable stance. At best its self-serving trade tactics will only produce temporary gains, over the long run as investors are predicting they are likely to batter the US.         "
US administration worried it isn't dominant enough: China Daily editorial,10/24/2018,"                          US Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the National Space Council Meeting at the National War College at the Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington, DC on Oct 23, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   According to US Vice-President Mike Pence, who also heads the National Space Council, the current administration in the United States will work with Congress, starting next year, to get a law passed to create an independent Space Force by 2020.  ""Space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air and sea, and America will be as dominant there as we are here on Earth,"" he said.  This despite the US being on the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. But, hey, what does that matter. As it is for trade, the military, science and technology, indeed everything else, it is all about US dominance.  The same is true of the US-Russia Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The US president has claimed it ties his country's hands while Russia allegedly develops missiles banned by the treaty. That, together with the pretext that China remains outside this essentially US-Russia bilateral agreement, boils down to the same anxiety - that US dominance may be softening.  As is evident in all recent moves the White House has taken, ""Make America Great Again"" is essentially an ambitious all-around rallying cry so America can have confidence it will remain firm and in pole position.  Clearly some people in Washington simply cannot feel confident unless they believe they are pushing the US higher and boasting of its staying power, which appear increasingly unrealistic these days.  The Russians got it right when they criticized Washington for dreaming of a unipolar world when the latter threatened to leave the INF, official notice of which the US government will present ""in due course"", according to National Security Adviser John Bolton.  Nothing may prevent the US from establishing a space force, or anything it likes. Likewise, it can choose to withdraw from the INF, or any bilateral or multilateral treaty, as it feels fit. That is a sovereign right it is entitled to.  But that ignores the credibility and moral authority of US global leadership the Trump White House is vainly trying to uphold. For its reckless, destructive disruption of the longstanding world order and governance institutions, the present-day US administration will be remembered for fast-forwarding the moral decline of the US like none of its predecessors has.  American voters have just been told their country is now ""respected again"".  But even with the claims to prowess, if the current trend persists, they will no longer need to consult a Pew survey to see the country's waning appeal.         "
Xi's Guangdong trip clarion call for reforms: China Daily editorial,10/24/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visits the Traditional Chinese Medicine Science and Technology Industrial Park of Co-operation between Guangdong and Macao in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong province, Oct 22, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   President Xi Jinping's inspection trip to South China's Guangdong province, which was the trailblazer for China's economic reform and opening-up 40 years ago, sends a strong message that the leadership has both the resolve and courage to continue on this path.  However, the international situation is different from what it was four decades ago, and so are the global obstacles and domestic difficulties China faces in deepening its economic reform and further opening itself up to the outside world.  That explains why President Xi stressed the importance of China achieving its own innovations while visiting the headquarters of Gree Electric Appliances in Zhuhai on Monday, saying that manufacturing is the core of the real economy and calling on Chinese enterprises to obtain core technologies through innovations of their own.  While it is true that China welcomes core technologies introduced from foreign countries, and cooperation is always necessary for innovations in this globalized world. The trade frictions with China unilaterally triggered by the United States, and the Donald Trump administration's increasingly hostile policies aimed at curbing the development of this country, have shown how important and urgent it is for China to make independent innovations.  The country's development over the past four decades has laid a solid foundation for the further progress of the country's industries, which have already made a lot of breakthroughs in science and technology in recent years.  However, there still remains much to be desired when it comes to the country's endogenous innovation capacity, and there are still many stumbling blocks that need to be removed so enterprises and research labs are able to effectively concentrate their resources on developing core technologies.  That explains why reforms can never cease, and why they must be furthered as extensively as possible so that all the barriers in the way of technological innovations can be swept away.  In the new round of reform, an institutional mechanism needs to be established for basic scientific research and the links between scientific innovations and the development of the real economy should be smoothed.  The past 40 years of reform and opening-up have made China prosperous and improved the lives of its people. What President Xi said in his Guangdong tour is a clarion call for a new round of reform and opening-up to make this country strong and powerful.         "
US playing high stakes game backing Taipei: China Daily editorial,10/23/2018,"                      Since it occurred in international waters… Since it was, in United States Pacific Fleet spokesman Commander Nate Christensen's word, ""in accordance with international law""... Especially since US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis just assured his Chinese counterpart of an unchanged US commitment to ""one China""... The two US military vessels' Monday transit through the Taiwan Straits hardly made a splash. Even though this was the second time the US Navy sent warships through the Taiwan Straits since July. And that has not been the case for some time. But it certainly means something. And the intention is believed to be two-pronged: showing US military muscles to the mainland and Taiwan, respectively sending a ""warning"" to the former and a message of ""assurance"" to the administration on the island. Like most similar operations the US Navy has conducted, such so-called freedom of navigation operations are like shadowboxing. Commander Christensen's claim of the transit demonstrating ""US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific"" was far-fetched, if not outlandish. The Indo-Pacific has never been unfree, unopen, with or without US gunboats. There is no sign China is preventing the US Navy from flying, sailing or operating ""anywhere international law allows"". But Beijing cannot be clearer about its bottom line: its sovereignty, a core national interest, is not to be compromised, by anyone, by any means. Not that Beijing does not care about peace. Or it would not have dispatched the biggest number of peacekeepers under the United Nations banner. But its own security interests by and large revolve around territorial integrity and national reunification. If the Monday voyage was indeed intended as a warning to Beijing, it will not work. The mainland will do whatever it takes to safeguard what it deems to be its core interests. But it may have sent a misleading signal to the independence-leaning authorities in Taipei, making them believe Washington will have them covered no matter what they might do. Should they cross the mainland's red line, however, they will be putting that faith to the test. Military hawks in Washington have tried hard to scare Beijing and console Taipei. But they should consider the dire consequences of their country being dragged into a costly confrontation that would in the first place be both unnecessary and avoidable. The odds against such a prospect shorten considerably if they do not know when and where to stop.         "
Bridge gets bay's greater integration under way: China Daily editorial,10/23/2018,"                          The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. [Photo/Xinhua]   After 14 years of planning and construction and weathering the destructive force of a super typhoon, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was declared open by President Xi Jinping at a ceremony on Tuesday.  The 55-kilometer Y-shaped bridge, which comes into operation for vehicles on Wednesday, links the two special administrative regions and a special economic zone, and will stitch the cluster of 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area closer together.  The successful completion of the bridge defied the negative predictions of many foreign experts who at first deemed the project technically infeasible. And its opening has dismissed suggestions that the structure would not be able to withstand the force of super typhoon Mangkhut, the fiercest storm to visit this part of the world in recent decades. The bridge, one of the longest fixed-links in the world, stood the test of nature, surviving intact and unscathed in the Lingding Channel, showcasing the excellence of Chinese engineering.  By reducing journey times between the three cities from three hours to 30 minutes, the bridge is expected to promote the flow of people and commercial interactions among the three places and provide a strong boost to the development of the Greater Bay Area.  The Pearl River Delta region serves as a significant external trade portal for the country. Last year its import and export trade volume constituted about 25 percent of the national total, a considerable proportion of it passing through Hong Kong. The bridge will make the logistics easier.  At the same time, innovation and technology are growth engines driving the country's economic development, and the Pearl River Delta region is an important base for R&D and new and emerging industries. The Hong Kong SAR, which Xi has said will have national support to develop into an international center for innovative technology, stands to benefit greatly from the closer links with other parts of the Bay Area.  With a price tag of about 15 billion yuan ($2.16 billion), the whole bridge-tunnel structure sounds expensive. But by enhancing connectivity across the delta region, which already accounts for 12 percent of China's GDP, it will provide a strong boost to industries and businesses in the Bay Area, one of the world's biggest and fastest growing economic areas.  The significant role it can play in national development more than justifies the huge investment, which has been shared by the three cities it connects.         "
Neighbors can push ties higher by embracing spirit of peace treaty: China Daily editorial,10/22/2018,"                      Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's upcoming official visit to China, which is due to start on Thursday, is another strong signal that the two neighbors are seeking to turn a new page in their relations. Ties between the two neighbors hit the rocks after the Abe administration nationalized some of the disputed islands in the East China Sea and were further soured by the recidivism of the views expressed by Abe and others on historical issues. While these sticking points have still to be resolved, the two neighbors have found themselves edging closer together as they have found themselves in the same boat while Washington runs amok trying to take down the global trade system with a chain saw. Both sides know that fostering closer, reciprocal and healthy interaction would be mutually beneficial, and a number of tangible trade and economic outcomes are anticipated. And if it views the trends of the times objectively, Japan will appreciate that China's development does not pose a threat to it, instead it offers a means for Japan to escape the woes of its moribund economy. Being able to put their differences aside for the sake of cordial relations would be a strong rebuttal of the Trump administration's anti-social behavior. But by working together they would also be able to promote a regional consensus on upholding the rules-based order. As the mainstays of the regional economy, by joining hands they could not only give it a shot in the arm but also provide impetus for a regional trade agreement. It is to be hoped therefore that reports prove correct that the countries intend to resume mutual naval visits, a practice that stalled in 2011. The resumption of such visits would be highly symbolic in this regard. They would also be of practical significance as a meaningful way for the two neighbors to reduce their strategic mistrust, which has festered and led both countries to boost their surveillance and patrol measures in the waters adjacent to the Diaoyu Islands. Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect the two sides to completely resolve their differences during Abe's visit. But as long as they embrace the spirit of the treaty of peace and friendship enacted 40 years ago, they can build on the current trend of rapprochement and seek ways to accumulate more mutual trust, thus paving the way for better and more rewarding ties.

Private enterprises vital for development: China Daily editorial,10/22/2018,"                          Workers assemble medical equipment in a manufacturing company in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. [Photo provided to China Daily]   The role of the private sector can never be overestimated given the fact that it contributes 50 percent of the country's tax revenues, 60 percent of its gross domestic product, 70 percent of its technological innovations, 80 percent of its jobs and 90 percent of new jobs and enterprises.  How absurd and ridiculous it is for some to suggest that the private economy has finished its historical mission and has to quit.  If it is not due to misinformation or ignorance, it must be out of ulterior motives that such a view is being expressed.  Little wonder that President Xi Jinping said in a letter to private entrepreneurs on Saturday: ""The historical contribution of nonpublic economy is indelible, its important role in the national economy is indisputable and any remarks or moves to underestimate or deny the role of this sector are definitely wrong.""  To be exact, China could not be what it is today without private enterprises, which injected energy into the national economy in the early 1980s. It was the responsibility system that contracted rural arable land to individual villagers that had made it possible for the country's agriculture to feed its population at that time. And it was the rise of township enterprises in the early stage of the country's reform and opening up that blazed the trail for the overall reform of the country's industrial sector.  The State-owned enterprises are pillars of the national economy and their role is indispensable. But that does not mean that the national economy can do without the sound growth of the private sector.  Despite its status as the second-largest economy in the world, China is still a developing country when it comes to its average per capita GDP and disposable income. The sound growth of the nonpublic economy is not only complementary to the State-owned economy, it is necessary to support the development of the national economy.  In his letter, Xi pledged that the Communist Party of China Central Committee will offer unwaveringly support to the private sector and he called on private entrepreneurs to grasp the trend of the era, and innovate and create without being distracted so as create a better tomorrow for the private economy.  The market responded positively to this promise, with most Asian markets up on Monday.  Not only is it clearly not the end of days for the private economy, but the private sector will be an important driving force for continued economic development.         "
US withdrawal from INF will open Pandora's box: China Daily editorial,10/21/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departure from Elko Regional Airport in Elko, Nevada, US, Oct 20, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It is to be hoped that United States President Donald Trump's threat to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is merely to woo votes in mid-term elections, or to exact concessions from Russia.  For if he does dismantle the historic treaty, the US president will be removing a crucial cornerstone of post-Cold War nuclear security regime, and truly opening a Pandora's box of troubles.  The 1987 treaty, which bans ground-launched nuclear missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles, put an end to a dangerous US-Russia nuclear standoff in Europe, and led to nearly 2,700 short- and medium-range missiles being eliminated. It has not only saved both signatories a costly and hazardous nuclear arms race, but offered reliable protection for the US and its allies in Europe and the Far East.  That is why NATO defense ministers issued a joint statement that describes the INF as ""crucial to Euro-Atlantic security"", and reiterated they remain ""fully committed"" to the ""landmark arms control treaty"", despite their concerns about Russia's latest missile capabilities.  That is also why some worried observers have called the prospect ""the most severe crisis"" in global nuclear arms control since the 1980s.  Should Trump pull the US out of the treaty, doubts will naturally arise whether the other significant US-Russia nuclear arms reduction treaty, the 2010 New START, which limits the number of deployed strategic warheads, will survive when it expires in 2021.  If the US withdraws from the INF, it will immediately reactivate a potentially lethal nuclear faceoff with Russia, with the US' NATO allies finding themselves again exposed to a direct nuclear threat from Russia.  And the domino effect will not stop there. Despite it being a bilateral treaty, Trump cited China among the reasons he was pulling the US out of the agreement. The hostility he has adopted toward China means that it will also feel the need to enhance its missile deployment.  Both Washington and Moscow have lodged similar complaints. Since both have questions about the other's honesty, they should resort to the inspection and verification procedures both had agreed to in the treaty and straighten things out.  As to US security concerns involving China, Beijing, too, has a lot to discuss with Washington, especially under the current circumstances, with deepening and broadening mutual distrust.  But that has nothing to do with the US-Russia INF Treaty, and should be handled independently.  Mixing the two essentially unrelated matters will do nothing except worsen strategic mistrust and breathe further life into a new Cold War.         "
Pompeo's remarks about China both ignorant and malicious: China Daily editorial,10/21/2018,"                                                 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks to the press before boarding his plane at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City, Mexico, Oct 19, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has just concluded a tour to Latin America in an apparent attempt to mend fences with countries in the region, as ties between Washington and its Latin American neighbors have been on a downward trajectory since Donald Trump became president.  While seeking to engage the region by touting the goodwill of the United States, Pompeo did not hesitate to stab China in the back, cautioning Panama and other nations about accepting China's loans under the Belt and Road Initiative.  The US top diplomat even pointed an accusing finger at Chinese State-owned enterprises for not being transparent and market-driven, alleging that they are pursing benefits only for the Chinese government. Such wild remarks are what we have come to expect from members of the Trump administration, being based on neither truth nor fact.  China and Latin American countries, though thousands of miles apart, have decided to upgrade and expand their reciprocal cooperation in recent years. They have decided to integrate their priority in bilateral cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China.  Viewing the Latin America region as natural participant in the 21st Maritime Silk Road, China looks to cooperate with countries in the region based on the principles of consultation and mutual benefits.  More important, rather than clinging to the outdated geopolitical maneuverings routinely adopted by some Western countries, especially the US, China is providing a new model of win-win cooperation in international relations.  In contrast, the vicissitudes between the US and various Latin America countries shows that the world's sole superpower continues to treat countries in the region as its subjects without due respect for their sovereignty and legitimate rights and interests.  Pompeo's latest undisguised message to Panama and other countries not to participate in China-proposed Belt and Road projects lays bare the US condescending and bullying manner to the region.  However, long gone are the days when Washington could dictate its will to those countries. The US will not succeed in disrupting China's legitimate and normal ties with these countries.  Washington continually tries this tired old tactic of trying to pin suspicions about China's motives on the Belt and Road so as hinder its advancement. Concerned that it undermines its own global status it continues to allege that it is creating ""debt traps"" for countries. And yet its warnings have repeatedly rung hollow and been shown to be nothing more than symptoms of its own insecurities, since the countries it so presumptuously tries to speak for continually refute these accusations.

Reality of Xinjiang different from that portrayed by West: China Daily editorial,10/18/2018,"                                                 Visitors pose for a selfie at the entrance of the Xinjiang International Bazaar in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. [Photo by Li Xiongxin/For China Daily]   When it comes to the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, it seems that two exist: One is the reality; the other is the one portrayed in the Western media.  The allegations they make to present their false picture of the region are aimed at smearing the Chinese government. These are nothing new and indeed are now somewhat stale, as they have been used for this purpose many times before. It has become routine practice for the West to take issue with this or that in China's national and religious affairs to portray an authoritarian system that denies people's liberties.  A double standard is put into service to serve this end - China, critics in the West say, only imagines it faces a terrorist threat, and it is just Western countries that face the real threat of violence born of extremism.  Thus US Vice-President Mike Pence said in his recent speech that China is engaged in ""religious persecution"" and the illegal imprisonment and brainwashing of Muslims in Xinjiang, in what some Western media have called ""concentration camps"".  Yet the reality is many young Muslims, especially in the four less developed areas in the southern part of the region, lack education and skills, which makes them vulnerable to the extremist propaganda promoted from overseas.  The reality is the ""government camps"" Pence spoke of are places where young people who have committed minor crimes and who may be otherwise led into terrorist acts can master the national language, gain knowledge of the law and acquire professional skills.  With the fall of the Islamic State, terrorists have been keen to spread their poisonous ideology to the region, and the government has every reason to act to prevent their evil influence from spreading and taking hold.  In fact, its innovative vocational training initiative in Xinjiang should be welcomed by the West as a meaningful contribution to the global fight against terrorism.  That Xinjiang has not suffered a violent attack in 21 consecutive months is partially attributable to the well functioning of the system that offers a better future to young people.  Last year, Xinjiang's economy grew by 7.6 percent, markedly higher than the national average of 6.8 percent, and tourists from home and abroad paid 132 million trips to the region, up 40 percent year-on-year. These statistics speak volumes about the social order in Xinjiang and the government's efforts to steer those at risk of being misled by extremism onto a law-abiding path. Such efforts have turned potential destroyers into builders.  The people of Xinjiang, who are of many ethnic groups, will definitely not allow a handful of bad apples to hijack the bright future of their common home.         "
Yuan's weakening not due to manipulation: China Daily editorial,10/18/2018,"                          Compared with the currencies of some emerging economies, the yuan has remained comparatively strong despite its recent weakening. [Photo/VCG]   In what was widely welcomed as a show of restraint by the United States not to exacerbate the frictions with China, the US government did not, as some anticipated, name China as a currency manipulator.  The decision was a slap in the face of those US politicians who have repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency. But it was also the correct decision, since China does not meet the three criteria set by the US for designating a currency manipulator.  According to the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, for a US trade partner to be named a currency manipulator it has to have a significant trade surplus with the US, have a material current account surplus at least 3 percent of its GDP, and persistently make one-sided interventions in the foreign exchange market.  Although China does have a large trade surplus with the US, its current account surplus has dropped to less than 2 percent of its GDP from the peak of nearly 10 percent a decade ago after its efforts to reduce its reliance on exports to boost growth.  And despite the headwinds it faces, China has refrained from driving down the yuan's value in favor of its exporters, and it has maintained a market-oriented exchange rate management regime.  It would be unreasonable to accuse China of manipulating its currency simply because the value of the yuan has fallen against the dollar.  Although the yuan has been weak in recent months — declining by almost 10 percent since April against the dollar — that is not the result of any adjustment by Chinese regulators. Instead, it has been caused by the uncertainties produced by the ongoing China-US trade frictions, the consistent strengthening of the US dollar, and the effect of the interest rate hikes in the US, which have led to capital flight out of the emerging and developing countries, including China.  Compared with the currencies of some emerging economies, the yuan has remained comparatively strong despite its recent weakening.The yuan's relative strength shows that the Chinese authorities have honored their commitment to allow the market to play a decisive role in deciding the yuan's value and not use its exchange rate as a tool to cope with the China-US trade dispute.  And now that the issue is out of the way, perhaps the two sides can move on to sort out their trade differences.         "
"Catch the corruption of flies, so they can't become tigers: China Daily editorial",10/17/2018,"                                                 Lai Xiaomin, former chairman of China Huarong Asset Management. [Photo/VCG]   It is rare for the word ""especially"" to be used three times to describe the corruption of a high-ranking official. But that is how the Communist Party of China Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervision Commission jointly announced that Lai Xiaomin, former Party secretary and chairman of the board of Huarong Asset Management, had been removed from office and expelled from the Party.  In a statement they described Lai's corruption as ""especially serious"", the nature of his abuse of power as being ""especially abominable"" and said that people's aversion to what he had done would be ""especially strong"".  Justification for the repeated use of the word comes from the fact that 270 million yuan ($39 million) in cash was found at Lai's home and the charges that ""he pursued personal glorification, engaged in superstitious activities and refused to cooperate in the investigation"".  In fact as was made clear, Lai spared no efforts in obtaining personal gains by whatever means possible, as he led an extremely extravagant and decadent life, including having a lot of mistresses.  ""As a Party member in a position of leadership, Lai lost his ideals and convictions, showing no Party consciousness or commitment to Party principles,"" the statement said.  Little wonder he was said to have no moral sense at all.  Digging out such a rotten apple is certainly an achievement of the Party's anti-graft fight. Yet, this case itself does provide some food for thought, since it is obvious that Lai did not acquire such a large sum in bribes in a single day. He must have been taking bribes for years. That he could remain in his position while abusing his power for so long suggests that the supervision of both the Party and government institutions still leaves something to be desired.  What is even more surprising is the fact that his wrongdoings had been reported to watchdogs many times by informants. He should have been busted years earlier had the supervisory departments paid enough attention to the tipoffs.  That corrupt elements can rise up the hierarchy of officialdom shows that supervision needs to be tightened to catch the ""flies"" before they become ""tigers"".  Of course, it would be even better if preventive mechanism could function effectively to ensure that it was impossible for officials to become ""flies"".         "
"Asia, Europe can join hands to resist US unilateralism: China Daily editorial",10/17/2018,"                          Asia and Europe will seek to strengthen their cooperation at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting Summit being held in Brussels, Belgium. [Photo/VCG]   With the United States intent on continuing with its unilateralism and protectionism, Asia and Europe will seek to strengthen their cooperation at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting Summit being held in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday and Friday.  ASEM is the highest-profile platform for dialogue between the two continents. The discussions this time are focused on the theme of Europe and Asia: Global Partners for Global Challenges, as the participants look to work together to prevent the global trade and investment order from being undermined by the unruly actions of the US.  Since the US strengthened its protectionist trade stance early this year and intensified its efforts to try and tilt the global system further in its favor, its major trade partners, such as the European Union and China, Japan and South Korea in Asia, have increasingly felt the pinch from Washington's unreasonable demands.  And with the US also withdrawing or threatening to withdraw from a number of multilateral trade and economic governance platforms, its self-indulgence is casting a subversive shadow over the global coordination and cooperation necessary to cope with various common challenges, such as rising debt levels and climate change.  It is of great significance, therefore, that Europe and Asia enhance their common ground and bridge their differences so that they can concentrate their joint efforts to uphold economic globalization and multilateralism in the face of Washington's debilitating efforts.  With the European Union putting forward its strategy for Eurasia connectivity, and the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative gaining steam, the ""distance"" between the two continents is shrinking, especially now the value of their shared appreciation of rules-based trade and investment exchanges has been fully recognized.  With the EU's new strategy similar to the Belt and Road Initiative in essence, the two sides can discuss how the two initiatives can be coordinated and reinforced through closer cooperation, efforts that will not only benefit the economies and people of the two continents, but those of much larger parts of the world.  A closer relationship between the two continents is dependent on candid exchanges to promote consensus-building, and the two-day meeting offers an important opportunity for the involved countries to enhance the mutual understanding and trust necessary for them to act as a bulwark against the US administration's attack on the global system.

"Even when battle is won, war against poverty must continue: China Daily editorial",10/16/2018,"                                                 Children of Se ethnic group sit in front of a monument that reads ""China's No. 1 Poverty Relief Village"" at Chixi Village, Panxi town, Fuding city in East China's Fujian province on Feb 14, 2016. The village has shaken off poverty thanks to assistance from Party and government officials at all levels over the past 30 years. [Photo/Xinhua]   On Wednesday, as we celebrate the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which is also the fifth Chinese Poverty Relief Day, an intensive campaign is under way throughout China to meet the official deadline for lifting all its impoverished people and regions out of poverty by 2020.  Millions of Party and government officials have been dispatched to the grassroots, in both urban and rural areas, to help win the ""decisive battle against poverty"". With compulsory quotas and criteria, they are racing against time so the country can bid a proud farewell to poverty on schedule.   China has an impressive record in the global fight against poverty, having lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past four decades. In a sense, reform and opening-up itself have been the most inclusive and most successful poverty relief program humanity has ever seen. Yet given the country's population base, the scale of abject poverty remains stunning even after consecutive, dramatic reductions in recent years.   According to the country's 2016 statistical report, based on the 2010 poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($332) per person a year for rural residents, 43.35 million people were still living in poverty. It certainly will be a great feat, and tremendous contribution to global poverty eradication, if the country can truly fulfill the ambitious goal as planned.  However, it would be questionable to take the current campaign as a ""last"", ""ultimate"" battle that can eliminate poverty in the country once and for all.   For one thing, China's poverty line is lower than that of the United Nations. More important, as numerous past cases have demonstrated, economic conditions of specific people and households can vary greatly over time. There is no lack of reports of people once ""lifted above poverty line"" falling back because of medical or other expenses. They are valuable reminders that, for the achievements of poverty alleviation to last, there has to be a reliable network of social security guarantees.   Despite the constant headway made over the past few years in improving that network, the guarantees available to those who need them the most remain meager and insufficient. While the last-minute efforts being made can be essential for a scheduled success, they do little in resolving that problem. Which is why relief endeavors should persist as long as poverty does.         "
Tightened security creates virtuous cycle in Xinjiang: China Daily editorial,10/16/2018,"                                                 Nearly 10,000 residents dance in local Dolan Maxrap folk style in Awat county in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on Oct 9, 2018. [LIU XIN/CHINA NEWS SERVICE]   When the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region suffered from explosions, assassinations, arson attacks along with attacks on innocent people and riots from the early 1990s until 2015, the Western media mostly blamed the Chinese government for all this.  When not a single such incident has occurred in the past more than two years since tightened security has been administered and measures have been adopted to undermine the root causes of terrorism, extremism and separatism, they accuse China of infringing on the human rights of the local people.  It should go without saying that the Chinese government must do anything it can to crack down on the three evil forces to ensure people's safety. It would be unimaginable for both the central and local governments to sit idle while residents of different ethnicities in the region were being deprived of their right to enjoy a peaceful life and economic development.  The interview with the Xinjiang government chief published on Tuesday is meant to tell the world what the Chinese government has done and achieved in this regard.  The fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism in the region is complicated. In its undeveloped southern part, the penetration of religious fundamentalism was deep as poor education resulted in the lack of awareness about the rule of law, and abject poverty allowed for the acceptance of religious extremism among local residents.  As a result, training was organized so that those not deeply involved in terrorist and extremist activities could be made aware of their wrongdoing and at the same time be taught some kind of professional skills, as well as Putonghua, to help them land a job.  The rationale behind the training is that only by providing local residents with a means for them to make a decent living will they be able to resist the temptation of participating in terrorist and extremist activities.  The tightened security control and what has been done to squeeze the room for the presence of the three evil forces has paid off.  In 2017, the region's GDP grew by 7.6 percent, and the per capita disposable income for urban residents increased by 8.1 percent, that for rural residents by 8.5 percent. The number of tourist trips to the region was more than 100 million, an increase of 32.4 percent over the previous year. The number of visits it had received from January to September already reached 132 million.  Little wonder that better security and social stability are bringing an economic boom to the region, and economic prosperity will in return help rid the region of extremism, terrorism and separatism.  This is a virtuous cycle.         "
It's always unwise to bet against Chinese economy: China Daily editorial,10/16/2018,"                          Yi Gang, governor of the PBOC. [Provided to China Daily]   The Chinese economy's resilience, reflected by such factors as stable GDP growth, mild consumer inflation, increasing corporate profits and rising household incomes this year, will disappoint those doomsayers that have been consistently short on the world's second-largest economy for its high debt levels and new uncertainties as a result of its trade disputes with the United States.  As Yi Gang, governor of the central bank, said at an academic symposium over the weekend, China is well on course to achieve its preset GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for the year, and it could possibly be higher; since economic indicators, such as the consumer price index, trade balance and consumption, show that the economy's fundamentals remain stable and that it is becoming more healthy with domestic demand becoming a more important driving force for growth.  China has also managed to keep its overall leverage levels under control as its debt levels have stabilized after increasing for many years in the post-crisis era, as shown by the research of some academic institutions.  Stable growth plus less financial vulnerability mean the country has the capability to cope with the uncertainties and ramifications of the US-initiated trade disputes.  The impact of the trade tensions on China's economic soundness is great, as Yi admitted, but it will only make it more difficult for the Chinese economy to regain its steam, not impossible. The Chinese economy has been on the downward cycle since 2007, and policymakers have reached a consensus that growth will remain at relatively low levels for quite a long time in the so-called L-shaped evolution.  However, one should not forget that China's economic expansion over the past 40 years has never been smooth. It has undergone frequent ups and downs, and each time it has faced obstacles, it has managed to overcome them through economic restructuring and policy innovations.  China is a developing country that started to shake off the planned economy only 40 years ago; its economic management is far from flawless. But its resolve and ability to make reasonable adjustments should not be underestimated.  As Yi said, the country will stick to its own agenda of accelerating reform and opening-up, strengthening intellectual property rights protection and creating a level playing field for all types of enterprises. Through those measures, it will become more efficient, competitive and accommodative, which will benefit itself and the world economy as a whole.            "
DPRK's moves naturally have proviso: better safe than sorry: China Daily editorial,10/16/2018,"                          ROK President Moon Jae-in (right) and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un. [Photo/IC]   Unimaginable just a few months ago, Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un may soon shake hands with his US counterpart at a second summit meeting.  Kim has on multiple occasions expressed readiness to forsake nuclear weapons, for which he had turned his back on the rest of the world. Now he is offering to allow international inspectors to verify the measures he has taken.He has also reportedly entrusted Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in to convey an invitation for Pope Francis to visit his country.  And his government has officially launched a website dedicated to soliciting investments in selected development projects, ranging from hotels to railways to power stations.  These are unmistakable gestures of goodwill, indicating genuine eagerness on his part for his country to rejoin the international community and pursue nation-building in a peaceful environment.  Moon, who has been behind most of those recent developments and has engaged personally with his northern counterpart, says he is convinced of Kim's sincerity, and is now calling on the rest of the world to reward Kim for what he has done.  If, as he told Le Figaro, Kim ""has taken the strategic decision to abandon his nuclear weapons"", this is indeed time for the international community, the United States in particular, to respond accordingly.  Given the initial steps Pyongyang has taken and pledged to take, it is important for the rest of the world to not keep Kim from feeling ""frustrated by the international community's continuing mistrust"".  Moon was correct in saying that ""we need to assure Kim Jong-un that he took the right decision in deciding to denuclearize and we need to accompany him in his wish for a durable and solid peace"".  This may not be easy. But the international community does need to prove its appreciation of the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula, and offer decent incentive for sustaining the fine momentum.  Moon's call for an official end to the Korean War reflects Pyongyang's foremost concern is for security guarantees in exchange for denuclearizing. Which is understandable considering the longstanding insecurity the DPRK has been made to feel by the US and its allies. Without this concern being properly addressed, all rhetoric about denuclearization may just be empty talk.         "
US playing Russian roulette with the global economy: China Daily editorial,10/14/2018,"                          Shipping containers are stacked up at the port of Antwerp in Belgium on July 26, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Mexico has told the Chinese government that the trade terms it agreed with the United States and Canada will not ruin its relationship with China.  In a phone call on Saturday, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgary told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that the trade terms it agreed with the United States and Canada do not represent an obstacle to Mexico's economic relationship with China.  That is good to hear, as it is important that trade agreements do not hinder the normal order of global trade by targeting another party, otherwise they will cause chaos in the global trade system.  The WTO-based global trade system, although it faces some challenges, has played an indispensable role in implementing the spirit of multilateralism and ensuring the smooth exchanges of goods and services worldwide in a fair and rule-based manner.  Regrettably, the United States has sought to shun the WTO system and carry out domestic law-based trade practices, such as imposing unreasonable tariffs on goods from its major trade partners, and forcing some of its trade partners to renegotiate their trade pacts with it to block trade exchanges with another party.  Such a discriminatory practice is absolutely unacceptable, and the victimized countries will have no choice but to hit back to protect their interests.  While it remains questionable whether the US' attempts at exclusion will work in taking down any third-party country, if such exclusionist behavior becomes established, it will set an unwelcome precedent that will have a long-term, adverse effect on the global trade system.  Such exclusionary agreements will bring more uncertainties to, and be detrimental to the healthy development of global trade at a time when a number of international organizations and research institutions have already expressed stark warnings that the ongoing trade disputes between the US and its major trade partners are dragging on global trade and economic growth.  The WTO system is not flawless, but it has been the major contributor to the global trade prosperity that has benefited all its members in the past decades.  For it to undergo the reform now needed to make it better able to serve to promote more balanced development of the world economy, its members need to sit down to work out a feasible solution through consultations on an equal footing. Resetting global trade in this way would ensure a stable global trade order that would be in the best interests of all, including the US.         "
Letter goes too far in telling Canada what to do with Huawei: China Daily editorial,10/14/2018,"                      When US senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio in a letter in recent days told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep China's tech and telecom giant Huawei out of its plans to build a new-generation mobile network, they were being presumptuous.  They need to be reminded that what they are doing is against the principles of free competition, which the United States repeatedly uses as an excuse to find fault with China, whose economy the US has long refused to recognize as a market one. That is part of the reasons why the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on imports from China.  US senators writing letters to the prime minister of a third country to dictate what that country should do or not do goes far beyond normal friendly relations.  For them as senators of a world power claiming to be a strong advocate of free world stronghold to be bold enough to flout the principles of global economy and world politics in such a manner is unbelievable. It is an interference with that country's internal affairs.  What sustains their audacious behavior is both the political bias against China in the US and their arrogance in being senators of that country, which is the world's sole superpower.  With political bias against China, they think only in terms of political ideology when it comes to anything that is related to China. They have gone too far to show any respect to trade rules and principles of international relations.  With arrogance and haughtiness as US senators, they believe that they are eligible to lord it over any other nation. For US politicians it seems that international rules are only for other countries to observe, and they do not apply to the US, when they are not in its interests.  However, when the US overemphasizes its political bias and puts its own interest before that of the rest of the world, the global economy is in jeopardy and so are normal international relations.  The US believes that other countries must follow what it dictates, and it is willing to take actions against them if they don't.  It is certainly unfair for Huawei, a Chinese technology and telecom company, to suffer because of man-made market barriers. It is not in the interests of those countries which have long been supplied with Huawei's equipment for telecommunications and neither is it in the interests of normal market competition.         "
Foreign companies know where bread is buttered: China Daily editorial,10/11/2018,"                                                 Workers work at a car general assembly line in Cangzhou, north China's Hebei province, Sept 12, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   There have been many reports about foreign investment closing up shop in China and fleeing to other emerging markets. For as Sino-US trade frictions continue to chill the investment environment, doomsayers are quick to point out any signs they perceive portending a coming winter for the Chinese economy. In their eyes, China is fast losing its allure as the world's top magnet for foreign investment.  To see the fallacy of such an assumption one needs only to look at the German automaker BMW AG, which announced on Thursday it will spend 3.6 billion euros ($4.1 billion) to increase its stake in its Chinese joint venture in Shenyang from 50 percent to 75 percent.  The German company, the first to take advantage of China's new policy to let foreign firms take majority control of their local partnerships, sees the additional investment as a major step in its strategy to consolidate its foothold in the world's largest car market.  Despite the anti-globalization trend - as represented by the trade disputes the United States has initiated with its major trading partners — the Chinese government has been standing pat in upholding the banner of free trade, and has reaffirmed its commitment by deepening reform and opening-up the country wider.  A new round of measures have been rolled out to ease the restrictions on market access, lower tariffs, streamline customs clearance procedures and speed up delivery of major foreign-invested projects. The move by BMW shows that these measures are starting to bear fruit, as Premier Li Keqiang noted when he met with BMW's CEO Harald Kruger on Wednesday.  What will surely reinforce global investors' confidence in the Chinese market was Li's pledge that in the future, these measures will be even stronger and the level of opening-up will be even higher.  There is no denying that for some foreign enterprises, the era of making ""quick money"" in China might have come to an end, as the cost of labor has increased and competition from domestic companies has intensified. Many of the preferential government policies they enjoyed also are no longer in place as the country embraces upgrading of its industry.  Yet given the growth potential that is being released by China's pivot to a more consumer-focused economy and its ongoing urbanization drive it undoubtedly remains attractive to foreign investors.  That explains why foreign direct investment in China grew by 7.9 percent in 2017 to reach an all-time high of $135 billion, according to the Ministry of Commerce. That upward trend has continued throughout the first eight months of this year.  Like BMW, investors with vision and insight know that the long-term growth of the global economy will be coming from China.         "
Australia and Japan should not let ally lead them astray: China Daily editorial,10/11/2018,"                                                 (L to R) Australia's Defense Minister Christopher Pyne, Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Japan's Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya attend a press conference in Sydney on Oct 10, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   In the trilateral relationship between the United States, Japan and Australia, ties between Tokyo and Canberra tend to be the weakest link. Under the encouragement of the United States, however, that link is becoming stronger, with the US making continuous efforts for its two allies to strengthen their strategic partnership.  On Wednesday, the foreign and defense ministers of the two countries concluded their ""two-plus-two"" talks, as they are known, in Sydney, stressing the need to bolster their defense ties, including increasing military joint exercises, amid what they described as the rapidly changing security environment in the region.  In their joint statement, the two countries announced they plan to stage their first-ever fighter jet exercise, dubbed ""Bushido Guardian"", in 2019. These overtures show although it is too early to say the two Pacific powers aiming to forge a military alliance in the true sense, they are certainly one step closer to becoming what what they are, namely ""quasi-allies"".  And their pledge to deepen security cooperation will not only deepen military-to-military ties between Tokyo and Canberra but also help expand each side's radius of military operations and thus enhance their defense forces' capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.  To cover up their real intention of jumping on the US bandwagon to contain China, Tokyo and Canberra pointed accusing fingers at China's so-called growing maritime assertiveness in Wednesday's joint statement, expressing concerns about the situation in the East and South China seas.  Such rhetoric does not hold water. It only lays bare the hypocrisy of the US and its allies because they have either helped create or provoked the maritime disputes in the waters themselves. While Washington has instigated the South China Sea disputes in recent years, Tokyo has single-handedly ratcheted up tensions in the East China Sea by nationalizing China's Diaoyu Islands.  Canberra and Tokyo should not allow the recurrence of the Cold War paranoia, that has already taken hold of the US, shape their actions. As key players in the region, Australia and Japan should work with China to help promote the region's development and jointly address common security challenges.  They should realize the full significance of a return of the full-scale mistrust of the Cold War, as it will create a fragile peace that risks being shattered by the slightest misstep. They should beware that letting the US lead them by the nose as it pursues a confrontational strategy toward China as that is really not in their best interests.         "
Inspections are shot in the arm for poverty alleviation: China Daily editorial,10/10/2018,"                                                 A villager in Jingxing village, Lingwu city, Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region, feeds chickens distributed by local government, Aug 28, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   How the targeted poverty alleviation efforts fare is key to the goal of building the country into a better-off society by the year 2020. This is a challenging task as more than 30 million poverty-stricken rural villagers still need to be lifted out of poverty in two years.  That explains why the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and State Supervision Commission announced on Tuesday that a new round of inspections will focus on the poverty alleviation work. Covering poverty alleviation work in 13 provinces, as well as 11 central government departments and two State-owned agricultural banks, the inspections will seek to uncover the problems that hamper the poverty alleviation efforts from achieving their goal.  Discipline inspection departments and procuratorates nationwide have already uncovered more than 45,000 cases involving poverty alleviation work in the first six months of this year. These include corruption, bureaucracy and bad working style, which have not only compromised the results of the poverty alleviation endeavors but also cast a shadow over the prospects for the work.  Some local officials have been found to have withheld the money that should have been given to villagers in abject poverty for their own use and some officials only did some superficial work rather than doing what they were supposed to. There is also too much red tape and bureaucracy that prevents policies from being carried out effectively.  It should go without saying that such inspections by a special team of the Central Party Committee are timely. The inspectors need to dig deep into the relevant central government departments and provincial governments to find out where the real problems lie and whether those officials in charge of the poverty alleviation work have dedicated themselves to the task they are entrusted with. Those who have made serious mistakes and those who have failed to do a good job need to be held accountable.  Previous inspections by such teams have shown their worth as quite a number of corrupt elements have been rooted out, and they have indeed helped to improve the working style of government departments and institutions.  If the goal of eliminating poverty is to be achieved in two years, it is essential that efforts to win the battle against poverty are not undermined by a lack of resolve or through impropriety or the fiduciary risks of misused or misappropriated funds. Therefore this round of inspections will help ensure victory in the nation's critical battle against poverty.         "
"Yuan's popularity continues to grow steadily, with reason: China Daily editorial",10/10/2018,"                                             Marking the first time a new currency has been added since the inauguration of the euro in 1999, the International Monetary Fund's inclusion of the yuan into its special drawing rights basket two years ago was hailed by China as a ""milestone"" and ""affirmation"" of the country's financial reform and opening-up.  It also caused quite a stir, with some voicing misgivings that the country's incomplete capital account convertibility process would mean the yuan would fail to become a true international reserve currency, while others fearing that China's commitment to financial liberalization might falter after its currency was included into the SDR basket.  The increasing confidence of other countries in the use of yuan, the fast and steady rise in the yuan's share in global foreign exchange reserves and China's unswerving financial opening-up over the past two years, have proved such worries to be unfounded.  In the second quarter of this year, the yuan's share in global currency reserves reported to the IMF jumped to 1.84 percent, up from 1.4 percent in the first quarter of this year and 1.08 percent in the second quarter of last year, according to IMF data.  Although the yuan's share is small compared to that of the US dollar and the euro, which account for more than 62 percent and 20 percent respectively, considering that it has only been included in the IMF currency basket for two years, the rise in its share is remarkable.  And the growing preference for the yuan is not without reason.  Although in the short term, the yuan does face heavy pressure given the strength of the US dollar and the trade dispute with the United States, China's stable economic fundamentals and financial opening-up policies, will ensure that the yuan's popularity will continue to grow and its share in global reserves continue to rise in the coming years.  China has vowed to further open up its economy. In terms of financial opening-up, it has stepped up efforts to liberalize its capital account; it has also announced this year it will further open up its banking, securities, insurance and futures sectors, making them more accommodative to international investors.  The opportunities offered foreign investors and China's increasingly more dynamic financial market and resilient economy will only increase external confidence in the world's second-largest economy, which will serve as a solid foundation for the growing demand for the yuan.

Australian politico shows she still can’t kick offensive habit: China Daily editorial,10/9/2018,"                      The Chinese embassy in Canberra was fully justified in hitting back at the “unwarranted invective and blatant slander” of Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in her latest criticism of Beijing’s aid program in the Pacific. Considering that China-Australia ties are at a new crossroad, politicians in Australia should make more contributions to bilateral cooperation, rather than continuing to throw mud at China, which is a key economic partner of their country.  On Friday, in an article published in The Australian newspaper titled “Bellicose China is popping up everywhere”, Federal Senator Fierravanti-Wells repeated the tired old accusation that China’s economic cooperation with the Pacific Island countries is a debt trap. This is not the first time that Wells has pointed an accusing finger at China’s collaboration with Pacific Island countries. In January, in her capacity as minister for international development and the Pacific, Wells accused China of providing loans to Pacific Island nations on unfavorable terms, only to prompt a strong rebuttal from the Pacific Island nations themselves, saying that she was not telling the truth and tarnishing the image of these countries.  By striking up the same old tune again last week, Fierravanti-Wells is trying to mislead the Australian public’s perception of China.  But her bias and malicious intentions will not daunt China and those countries from engaging in cooperation based on the principles of equality and reciprocity that is helping people in the region enjoy better lives. Wells and those with like-minded views should ask themselves how much Australia has done to improve the livelihoods of the people in the Pacific Island nations.  In recent years, Australia has been under increasing criticism from the outside world for neglecting the Pacific Island region. Viewing it as its own backyard, Canberra seems only want to bask in its traditional geopolitical influence in the region without making due contributions to the region’s development.  Worse, there is a worrying tendency that Canberra and Washington now view the region as an arena in which they are competing for influence with China. In fact, the Pacific is big enough for the three countries to engage in regional cooperation. Canberra and Washington should discard the Cold War mentality and join hands with Beijing to build a better future for people in the region.         "
IMF right to decry US shift from rules-based trade: China Daily editorial,10/9/2018,"                             Maurice Obstfeld, Economic Counsellor and Director of IMF (L) talks as Wafa Amr, Communication Officer of IMF listens, during their press conference at the 2018 International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Bank Group Annual Meeting at Nusa Dua in Bali, Indonesia, October 9, 2018 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. The session discusses the future of economic prospects in various countries in the world.[Photo/Agencies]   The IMF’s downgrading of its global growth forecast for next year, the first time in more than two years, highlights the downside risks to global growth have risen as a result of the trade disputes instigated by the United States.  The organization said on Monday that the global economy will grow by 3.7 percent this year and next, down from the 3.9 percent projection in its previous forecast.  Notably, while lowering its forecast for China’s growth to 6.2 percent in 2019 from its earlier 6.4 percent, the fund also cut its forecast for US growth for next year to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent.  Admittedly, the monetary policy tightening of the advanced economies, especially the US, is a factor behind the forecast adjustments of the fund. The interest rate increases of the US Federal Reserve have already led to fluctuations in the global financial markets, with the emerging markets having borne most of the pressure from decreasing capital inflows as a result of the tightening monetary stance of the Fed.  But the fund warned that key threats to the global outlook are the intensification of trade tensions caused by the US unilaterally imposing additional tariffs on some of its main trade partners and its shifting away from the multilateral, rules-based trading system. It said the associated rise in policy uncertainty was denting business and financial market sentiment, triggering financial market volatility, and slowing investment and trade, with the fracturing of global supply chains and slowing spread of new technologies “lowering global productivity and welfare”.  Which is why IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld called for the mechanisms of multilateral global policy cooperation to be strengthened.  Ten years ago, the world economy was battered by a global financial crisis, with only the close cooperation among major economies saving the world economy from a prolonged recession.  Although there is no sign of any recurrence of a similar crisis yet, countries should, as Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF urged last week, de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes and join hands to enhance policy coordination to build a global trade system that is ""stronger, fairer, and fit for the future”.  The report comes as global financial ministers and central bankers gather in Bali, Indonesia, this week to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. It is to be hoped that what are likely to be heated discussions on trade will ultimately lead to an easing of the trade confrontations. Prolonging and exacerbating the trade frictions will only worsen the situation and prevent joint global efforts to maintain the world’s healthy but vulnerable trend of economic recovery.         "
Reserve requirement ratio cut will support real economy: China Daily editorial,10/8/2018,"                                                 An investor watches a board showing stock information at a brokerage office in Beijing, China October 8, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   China's cut in the banking reserve requirement ratio, or amount of cash that banks are required to hold as reserves, announced on Sunday, failed to hold back the selling spree in the domestic A-share market on Monday.  But it will, together with previous three cuts this year, help channel funds into the country's real economy and boost the growth of the Chinese economy.  Monday's domestic stock market tumble is, to an extent, attributable to investor concerns as a result of the easing growth and the ongoing trade tensions in many parts of the world. But it was also a normal reaction to the accumulative pressure from the steep sell-offs in overseas markets in the past week, after the Chinese stock market reopened after its weeklong closure for the National Day holiday.  Although some economic indicators eased slightly in August, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain unchanged and it remains on the track of fast and stable growth.  The industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment are still growing at a reasonably fast pace, as shown by August data released by the statistics authority, even though China is undergoing the Herculean task of economic restructuring and deleveraging.  The Caixin business sentiment index for services, a private survey-based gauge of activity released by Caixin Media, a major media group in China, rebounded in September to 53.1 from 51.5 in August, indicating that the service sector, a major contributor to overall growth, remains healthy.  The authorities are also looking at measures to boost the corporate sector to help stabilize the real economy and employment in the face of the downward pressures caused by the trade dispute with the United States. The Ministry of Finance, for instance, has said that it is considering new tax cut measures on the top of a series of tax cuts so far this year to spur credit demand from the real economy, especially the private sector. The government has also pledged to expedite plans to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects.  Such measures to lower financing costs and boost growth should ease concerns about the drag on the Chinese economy caused by the trade dispute.  Indeed, the sound fundamentals of the Chinese economy demonstrate its resilience and capability to withstand the headwinds of Washington’s economic aggression, while still giving the government room to promote the transformation to high-quality development.

Talking only way for US and China to get on same page: China Daily editorial,10/8/2018,"                                                 Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Beijing on Oct 8, 2018. [Photo by Feng Yongbin/China Daily]   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to China, which started on Monday, comes at a time when relations between the world's two largest economies are at one of their worst points since they established diplomatic ties four decades ago.  Trade frictions aside, days before Pompeo's trip to Asia, US Vice-President Mike Pence opened fire on China in a blustering speech that scatter shot groundless accusations against China, and depicted it as an evil empire seeking to contest the geopolitical advantages of the US and change the international order.  The speech, with its wordings reminiscent of how the US targeted the former Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, seemed intended to mark a confrontational policy shift toward China by the Donald Trump administration.  Which meant Pompeo's Beijing visit came at a timely moment, as it may serve as yet another chance to find ways to prevent the already fast-sinking relations from going into free fall. At times of uncertainties, it is imperative the two sides remain sober-minded and keep the door to constructive communications open.  As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday when he met with Pompeo, the misguided actions and hostile rhetoric of the US cast a shadow over the China-US relations, which must not descend into conflict and confrontation.  Despite their differences, there is no denying that their cooperation benefits both countries. But it is not only in their common interests, but also a mutual necessity because in today's world there are many a global issue that no country can deal with single-handedly.  Amid the rising tensions in bilateral ties, it has been Beijing's consistent position to try and resolve the problems in China-US relations, from trade to intellectual property to market access, through talks on the basis of an equal footing and mutual respect.  That is why China's response toward the US has always remained measured and well reasoned, not only in face of US imposing hefty tariffs on increasing amounts of Chinese goods, but also when constantly provoked on Taiwan or in the South China Sea. For it still believes that their common interests far outweigh their differences, and there are many reasons to make the relationship better, and not a single one to make it worse.  But friendship is not one sided and goodwill must be reciprocated. It was heartening therefore after Pence's rant, that Pompeo said that US does not oppose China's development, has no intention of blocking China, nor does it have a comprehensive policy to contain China.  As he acknowledged, it is important that the two sides strengthen communication, enhance trust and strengthen their cooperation on the basis of rules.         "
Two systems still in place despite claims to contrary,10/8/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   Ungrounded accusations from some foreign governments over the decision by the Immigration Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region not to renew the work visa of a foreign correspondent in the SAR are the latest attempt to undermine the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and attack the central and SAR governments.  Although the Hong Kong immigration authority has not given any specific reasons for not renewing the work visa of Victor Mallet, Asia news editor at the Financial Times, it is a usual practice of immigration authorities worldwide not to comment on individual cases, and visa renewal is a sovereign right that no other governments are allowed to interfere in.  Foreign governments demanding an explanation know this. What they really want is not an answer but to create the illusion that freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong is dwindling.  The fact is, Hong Kong's Immigration Department rejects countless visa renewal applications for various reasons every year, and dwelling on the visa problem of one foreign journalist in the city is nothing but making a mountain out of a molehill. The news media in Hong Kong, local or foreign, is operating as freely as before and nobody's voice, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the law, is stifled. Hong Kong certainly imposes much less immigration restraints than the United States does on the grounds of national security.  There is also the allegation that the central government is trying to ""mainlandize"" the SAR. In fact, should ""mainlandization"" mean the SAR further integrates into the country's overall development strategy, it is something good and what the SAR should continue to do. However, the accusers' real intention is to smear the way ""one country, two systems"" is being practiced.President Xi Jinping has repeatedly pointed out: ""one country, two systems"" is to be implemented without any distortion. Thus the commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong has resolutely voiced his support to the SAR authorities for duly exercising their power over immigration affairs vested in them by the Basic Law.  Contrary to the picture foreign politicians and activists have painted, the SAR is maintaining its unique system as enshrined in the Basic Law while moving forward together with the country in various aspects.

Concrete moves needed for denuclearization: China Daily editorial,10/7/2018,"                                                 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wraps up his fourth visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after meeting Kim Jong-un on Sunday. [Photo/Agencies]   Absent the widely anticipated agreement on a second summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's fourth trip to Pyongyang did not produce the widely expected outcome.  Yet let's not call the visit fruitless.  Considering the top US diplomat did not even meet with Kim Jong-un on his last visit, and he and Kim talked for two hours this time, with the latter promising to continue working toward denuclearization, it was as said ""better than last time"".  Both Pyongyang and Washington have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of progress made since US President Donald Trump and Kim met in Singapore in June, and they have both questioned the other's sincerity. While Washington has insisted Pyongyang has not done enough to denuclearize, the latter has argued it needed to see the former reciprocate.  Pyongyang having dismantled a nuclear test site and then missile facilities, agreeing to a peace treaty to end the 1950-53 war, which concluded with armistice, would have cost nearly nothing on Washington's part and been a reciprocal sign of good faith, especially given Pyongyang had earlier offered to dismantle another nuclear site.  With a peace treaty seemingly not yet forthcoming, that Pyongyang and Washington have reaffirmed their shared willingness to sustain their detente is in itself surely something worth celebrating. With all that has happened, or not happened, a common resolve to keep things moving forward toward amicable relations and denuclearization of the peninsula is surely precious.           "
China and US need trust and cooperation: China Daily editorial,10/5/2018,"                          US Vice President Mike Pence addresses the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, on October 4, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Were it not for the opening paragraphs that depict China as ungrateful to the United States' bounty, or the ending menace in which he urges China to ""reach back"", US Vice-President Mike Pence's beggar-thy-neighbor speech at the Hudson Institute on Thursday was nothing but a duplicate of outdated concepts of Cold War mentality and zero-sum games.  Speaking with fervor and assurance, but sadly without facts, Pence, in a stream of groundless accusations, accused China of aggressively trespassing upon US interests, while flaunting how the current US administration's policies have worked out.  However, as the Foreign Ministry noted on Friday, the accusations are unwarranted, slander China, confuse right and wrong and create ""something out of thin air"", which China firmly opposes.  And although China wants to resolve the trade conflict, the US keeps changing its position. Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, has said that although both sides had made headway, the demand from the US changed ""overnight … this is very confusing, and making things very difficult"".  By the way, what Pence wants is not a prosperous China, but an obedient China that should be forced to follow US terms whether in trade, cross-Straits ties, international cooperation or even China's territorial integrity.  The impatience flowing between the lines in Pence's speech laid bare the US administration's anxiety, in part, over China's peaceful rise, for which the Chinese people need not feel indebted, or grateful, to any other country.  The speech, which weaved ironically between a palpable victim mentality and a strong sense of condescending superiority complex, shows the administration must carefully hide that it is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. No US administration has been so ""successful"" and yet so controversial.  And if it is the US administration's strategic decision to turn its hostility to all-out confrontation, as Pence's tirade hints at, this would shake up the foundation of one of the world's most important bilateral relationships.  China unswervingly pursues the path of peaceful development, and will by no means seek its own development at the expense of the interests of the US or other countries.  Since China and the US, as the world's two largest economies, have broad shared interests, they have few options in their bilateral ties, except for mutually beneficial cooperation on fair, equal and reciprocal terms — if they are both true to their common mission as responsible big countries.  The future of world peace hinges on the abilities of the two countries' leaders to coordinate their national interests and prevent competition and tension, which always exist, from escalating to violent conflict.  But achieving that goal needs the commitment from both sides to build trust, expand cooperation and manage their differences in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

US' unilateral trade policies could slow global growth: China Daily editorial,9/27/2018,"                                             How refreshing it is to listen to the voice of reason in these times made turbulent by the US' unilateral and protectionist policies. Especially, when the voice affirms the international community remains seriously concerned about the trade policies of the world's largest economy which could reverse the trend of healthy global economic growth.  That voice is Christine Lagarde, managing director and chair of the International Monetary Fund, and her remarks came at a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday.  So serious are the international community's concerns that consensuses such as that reached by the United States, the European Union and Japan on trade issues of ""third countries"" on Tuesday cannot alleviate, let alone eliminate, them.  Moreover, despite the statement of the three countries' trade representatives that the three sides will make efforts to address ""unfair trade"", the EU and Japan remain deeply divided over trade issues with the US.  As the global economic and trading system has become increasingly sophisticated, frequent trade disputes among major economies have occurred. But they had been largely using rational means to try to resolve their disputes.  And then everything changed in US trade and geopolitical policies. The Donald Trump administration's protectionist and anti-globalization policies are aimed at ""making America great again"" at the cost of the multilateral trading system and the world economy.  Since becoming president, Trump has withdrawn the US from many multilateral pacts and global bodies, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord, and threatened to pull out of the World Trade Organization.  As the most powerful economic power, the US has pressured other countries into accepting its terms for trade and cooperation, and forced its trade partners to rewrite previously inked trade deals, inviting fierce opposition from the EU, China and Japan.  China has made its economic stance clear: It is willing to resolve trade disputes with other economies, whether it is the US, the EU or Japan, through consultations based on equality and fairness, and find solutions that fulfill the interests of all parties.  But if the US makes unilateral and protectionist moves to realize its selfish goals, China will be the last country to accept them - it will always resist all types of bullying tactics.         "
White House barking up the wrong tree yet again: China Daily editorial,9/27/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, Sept 20, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Perhaps the leader of the United States is concerned about his performance both as president and as a global leader. Perhaps that's why he is grasping at straws.  Failing to catch any straws, he has blamed China.  ""China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November. Against my administration,"" he told a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday. ""They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.""  The rhetoric sounds familiar, except this time China is being accused of directly interfering in the US' internal affairs. But as always, when the US leader makes accusations, evidence is missing.  US intelligence and election officials have unequivocally said they have no credible evidence that China is interfering in the midterm elections. So, it seems, he is trying to use the UN as a platform to garner votes in the midterms.  Non-interference in other countries' internal affairs is a basic international principle that China has always upheld. Reiterating this stance at the UN, Foreign Minister Wang Yi rejected the US leader's ""unwarranted accusations against China"", and called on other countries, the US in particular, to honor the UN Charter, by not interfering in other countries' internal affairs.  Whether the US will heed Wang's counsel is anybody's guess, for when it comes to interfering or trying to interfere in other countries or their elections, Washington is a past master. The US has a long history of meddling in other countries' elections — more than 80 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database compiled by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University. The number doesn't include military coups and efforts made to change a regime after the victory of leaders whom the US didn't like.  Two decades ago, Time magazine reported how US political consultants ensured Boris Yeltsin was re-elected as Russian president, much to the joy of Washington.  It is an irony, then, that US intelligence agencies are now investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. If the US leader really wants to save his political career, he should look to the economy rather than staring daggers at China - and heed the opinion of US businesses that the trade conflicts he has started are counterproductive.  Making China the scapegoat for US ills will benefit neither the US nor its president.         "
An isolationist US can't get 'great again': China Daily editorial,9/26/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump addresses the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, Sept 25, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Three years before entering the White House, US President Donald Trump tweeted that his country needs ""a president who isn't a laughingstock to the entire world"", ""a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning"".  The laughter he drew at the United Nations General Assembly notwithstanding, he is almost there, at least in his own eyes, for his administration ""as accomplished more than almost any administration"" in US history and ""the United States is a stronger, safer and a richer country"" than when he assumed office ""less than two years ago"".  It did not matter to Trump that he was touting his achievements to the wrong audience. His self-gratification may have been a harmless comic episode to the other national leaders and diplomats at the UN General Assembly. But his elaboration of US foreign policy is very bad news for the rest of the world.  What Trump delivered was tantamount to a farewell to the post-World War II world order featuring multilateralism, if not globalism.  Most countries will welcome Trump's statement that ""the US will not tell you how to live and work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return"". Few would argue against Trump embracing the ""doctrine of patriotism"". Even ""America First"" is fine, as long as it does not cause harm to others.  But his rejection of the ideology of ""globalism"" is contrary to even his own claim that his government is ""also standing up for the world"". His speech sends a clear message that the US, which in his words will ""soon be more powerful than it has ever been before"", will go it alone and break away from the global governance regime which it helped build in the first place.  To Trump, the UN, a core institution and platform of postwar global governance, is ""an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy"" to which his government ""will never surrender America's sovereignty”.  The ""independence and cooperation"" Trump seeks is evidently not what multilateral institutions such as the UN stand for. Trump's refusal to accept such longstanding, and mostly effective multilateral global governance mechanisms will cause an immeasurable loss to the international community, and significantly undermine global peace and security as far as such crucial institutions as the UN Security Council are concerned.  French President Emmanuel Macron rightly emphasized that ""confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength, rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect"".  Macron could also have said, an isolationist and protectionist US cannot go too far in its pursuit of greatness.         "
"Fair competition, not confrontation required: China Daily editorial",9/26/2018,"                                             No one emerges winner in a trade war. Instead, its adverse effects spill across borders. Indeed, the forecast for Asia is a drop in economic growth rate as the US-China trade conflict threatens to inflict more collateral damage on the region's export-reliant economies. An Asian Development Bank report issued on Wednesday said the region's growth will drop from 6.0 percent this year to 5.8 percent in 2019.  This is not the first time international institutions have sounded the alarm over the potential economic damage a trade war between the world's two largest economies can do to the global economy. Earlier, the International Monetary Fund warned the world economy could lose $430 billion by 2020 if the Sino-US trade conflict escalates.  Yet such warnings have fallen on the deaf ears of US President Donald Trump, who went ahead and imposed additional tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports on Monday, forcing China to respond by levying tariffs on $60 billion of US goods.  Rising US protectionism has become the biggest threat to global recovery, as higher tariffs will inevitably hurt consumer sentiments, disrupt supply chains, and dampen business confidence. Which could ultimately lead to global recession.  On the other hand, an increasingly inward-looking United States will only force other economies to further open up their markets and forge closer economic ties, shifting the global economic center of gravity away from the US.  China and the US would only lose if they confront each other, as State Councilor Wang Yi said at a meeting with former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger on the sidelines of a United Nations General Assembly session in New York on Tuesday.  It is still not late for Trump to abandon his Cold War mentality and change course, for his moves have already raised tensions over a range of issues, from the trade conflict and the Taiwan question to the sanctions against a People's Liberation Army department and its chief.  And on Wednesday, the US said it is considering imposing economic penalties on Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. If it does so, it would be a blatant interference in China's internal affairs - a violation of China's sovereignty.  The US' actions have not benefited any country, least of all the US, so it's high time the US president realized that for peace and prosperity, the world needs fair competition, not confrontation between major powers.

Ban makes clear Hong Kong has no place for separatists: China Daily editorial,9/25/2018,"                                             The outlawing of the ""Hong Kong National Party"" has sent a strong signal across the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that separatist activities will not be tolerated. The ban of the party that advocated ""Hong Kong independence"" also sends a clear message that the central and SAR governments will defend at all costs the country's territorial integrity and the principle of ""one country, two systems"" - the red line President Xi Jinping emphasized in Hong Kong last year.  The decision taken under Section 8(2) of the Societies Ordinance on Monday is an important and timely move given the intensifying activities of some pro-separatist foreign forces, including some Western media outlets.  The decision, first of all, is a castigation of the Foreign Correspondents' Club, Hong Kong, for inviting the now banned group's convener Andy Chan Ho-tin to a live-stream luncheon talk on Aug 14 despite the strong protests from the Hong Kong chief executive, the commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in the SAR and society at large.  Chan's FCC talk was part of a much larger anti-China chorus. More recently, The Economist invited former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten and ""self-determinists"" Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow to its Open Future Festival in Hong Kong on Sep 15 to ""comment"" on Hong Kong's future. Two days later, disqualified legislator Yau Wai-ching cooked up facts for an article, ""Democracy's demise in Hong Kong"", which appeared in The New York Times.  The media are but the foot soldiers. Behind them, or working in tandem, are various foreign governments and their agencies, which present reports on the political and economic situation in Hong Kong in a way they want the rest of the world to believe.  These reports have one thing in common - they pretend to be worried about how well the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the rule of law are being implemented in Hong Kong. In reality, their false accusations and biased news reports combine to undermine the very principles they claim to protect. Their defense of people like Andy Chan, for instance, under the pretext of freedom of speech, is providing Hong Kong separatists moral support and publicity platforms.  Those who truly support Hong Kong and the ""one country, two systems"" principle are definitely not those who merely pay lip service to the well-being of Hong Kong. So, to protect the core interests of Hong Kong and the country in the current volatile geopolitical situation, legislation of a national security law according to Article 23 of the Basic Law is the way to go.

US threatening to cross red line of bilateral ties: China Daily editorial,9/25/2018,"                                             In a sign that it will not hesitate to make more moves that could worsen the already highly strained Sino-US relations, the Donald Trump administration has approved the sale of spare parts for F-16 fighter jets and other military aircraft worth up to $330 million to Taiwan.  The move comes four days after the US sanctioned the People's Liberation Army's Equipment Development Department and its director for purchasing Russian fighter jets and missile systems, which evoked sharp protests from Beijing and justifiably so because Washington has been blatantly violating the basic norms of international relations.  The intensity, pace and scale at which Washington has been trying to provoke Beijing - from trade to the South China Sea to Taiwan - expose the confrontational strategy of the Trump administration. Such provocations, however, conform to the 2018 US National Security Strategy report that identified China as a strategic competitor that must be confronted.  That explains why the Trump administration has been recklessly trampling on the one-China principle, the political foundation of Sino-US relations. Since taking office, Trump has played the Taiwan card many a time, for example, by signing the Taiwan Travel Act and the National Defense Authorization Act to encourage visits between high-level US and Taiwan officials and pave the way for regular ports of call by US warships in Taiwan.  Nearly four decades ago, Beijing and Washington normalized diplomatic relations on the basic premise that they both respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that the United States ""does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan"" and will gradually ""reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution"", according to Sino-US Joint Communiqué of Aug 17, 1982.  History is witness to how the US has repeatedly contravened its own promises, and has always been ready to trade principles for expediency. Now that the Trump administration is aggressively seeking to challenge China's interests on both the economic and military fronts, one wonders whether Washington wants to permanently damage Sino-US relations.  And since the Trump administration is trying to jettison all principles that govern bilateral relations in a desperate bid to suit its own purpose, China should not only prepare for the worst but also be ready to appropriately respond to the US' provocations, because when it comes to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is absolutely no room for compromise.

US ruining 'big picture' of bilateral relations: China Daily editorial,9/24/2018,"                                             One can argue that the ongoing tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington is not a trade war despite US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and Chinese tariffs on $60 billion of US products taking effect on Monday.  One can even say the White House sanctioning a Chinese military agency and its director for purchasing Russian fighter jets and missiles, which invited ""stern representations"" and suspension of inter-military talks by Beijing, was ""collateral"" damage.  And one can continue assuming that relations between China and the United States will not worsen beyond a certain point because their economies are too closely interwoven. And following the same logic, the two sides will make sure the trade conflicts, if they still do not signify a trade war, do not spill over into other areas and ruin the ""big picture"" of bilateral relationship.  Punitive tariffs may not be as damaging to Beijing as Washington believes, and the US will not escape unscathed, which could damage growth prospects across the broader world economy.  But that is not the moot point. That the issue is increasingly moving beyond trade is the real cause of concern, and that is where the real danger lies.  When a trade conflict spills over into other aspects of bilateral ties, the consequences become hard to predict. That's why signs of the accelerating drain on mutual goodwill deserve serious attention from both parties.  Although Washington has repeatedly named Beijing as a strategic competitor, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo's description of it as a greater threat to the US than Russia is hard to digest. So are his labeling of Beijing as a ""non-transparent government"", and his allegation of ""awful abuses"" of religious groups, which have drawn strong rebuttals from China.  Such accusations, along with those on trade, ranging from alleged ""theft"" and forced transfer of intellectual property to other ""unfair"" practices, undermine the longstanding consensus between the two governments on the need to build a productive relationship. If the US' strategic moves are meant to reinforce its bargaining advantage in trade negotiations, they may actually end up rendering further engagement even more difficult, if not completely impossible.  In such worrying circumstances, the US' hostile moves, if they continue, will further undermine relations between the two countries and militaries, as well as impair Sino-US strategic trust and cooperation on major regional and international issues.

Talks still best way to settle trade disputes: China Daily editorial,9/24/2018,"                                             The white paper on the trade frictions with the US testifies to China's sincerity in resolving the disputes through dialogue and its firm opposition to trade bullying, which Washington must give serious thought to if it wants to maintain healthy trade and economic relations with Beijing.  But not content with US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods — which prompted China to respond with tariffs on $60 billion of US products — taking effect on Monday, the Donald Trump administration has threatened to take more measures to force China to accept its demands. Which means the trade disputes between the world's two largest economies could further escalate, if the two sides cannot find a way to break the deadlock. And the trade conflicts, if they escalate, will jeopardize interests on both sides, whose repercussions will be felt by rest of the world.  China and the US, as the white paper says, have made strenuous efforts over the past four decades to maintain largely sound economic ties to the benefit of both sides.  For the US, for example, its exports to China increased nearly six-fold from 2001 to 2017, compared with the 112 percent rise in exports to its other trade partners. China's exports to the US, on the other hand, have helped the US maintain a low inflation rate, and its investments have created large numbers of jobs in that country.  Given that weakened bilateral trade and economic relations will undermine US industries and hurt consumers, the Trump administration ought to reconsider its policy of seeking short-term gains at the cost of the US' long-term economic well-being.  Washington has repeatedly accused Beijing of breaking intellectual property rights laws and using irregular means to make trade gains. But the white paper, published by the State Council, China's Cabinet, on Monday, shows such US accusations are unfounded, and it is blaming China for its own failures with the ulterior motive of thwarting China's normal development plans.  The US' unilateral trade moves have not only damaged normal China-US trade activities, but also could stunt world economic growth.  So if the Trump administration continues to stick to its unilateral and protectionist stance, and refuses to respect the fundamental norms of mutual respect and consultation, it would be difficult for the two sides to make substantial progress in any future trade talks.  The white paper says in unambiguous terms that China is willing to restart trade talks with the US, provided they are based on mutual respect and equality. The ball therefore is in the US' court.         "
"By winning party polls, Abe raises both hope and fear: China Daily editorial",9/20/2018,"                                                 Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is also the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader, attends a news conference after he won the ruling party leadership vote at the party's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan Sept 20, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Abe has long sought to revise Japan's pacifist Constitution ignoring the strong domestic and international opposition. And now that he has been re-elected leader of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which paves the way for him to serve as Japan's prime minister for another three years, he may try to push forward what critics call Japan's ""remilitarization"" plan.  There is reason for such fears, because Shinzo Abe has already pushed through controversial legislation that gives Japan Self Defense Forces the right to ""collective self-defense"", or defend/support allies in combat overseas.  Of course, Abe's claim that he would try to keep the constitutional clause that prevents Japan from waging an offensive war may somewhat help ease the regional countries' fears that Japan may embark on the road to militarism again.  But continuous efforts by rightwing forces in Japan to whitewash history and deny Japan's wartime atrocities - such as the Nanjing Massacre and the pain and suffering they caused to hundreds of thousands of Asian women by forcing them into sexual slavery - will continue to haunt Japan's neighbors, including China, that Japan may be moving closer to becoming a military power again.  As such, in the coming three years, Abe will find it extremely difficult to convince Japan's neighbors about his good intentions if he forges ahead with his plan to amend the country's pacifist Constitution.  Yet there are signs that Sino-Japanese relations are moving toward the right track, with Abe expected to pay an official visit to Beijing later this year - the first by a Japanese leader in seven years - which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship. There are also reports that the world's second- and third-largest economies are ready to cooperate, rather than compete with each other, on agriculture and infrastructure projects in other countries, particularly along Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor.  That their economies are highly complementary and they both advocate free trade may make it possible for the two sides to shelve their differences while they pursue to maximize the common interests.  Abe recently said that he hopes ""to raise Japan-China relations to a new stage"" and he is ""firmly determined in this regard"". As convincing as he may sound, there is no reason to take his remark at face value. We hope, though, he will match his words with concrete actions and thus contribute to improved Sino-Japanese relations.         "
Speculation and suspicion certainly not diplomacy: China Daily editorial,9/20/2018,"                                             Several recent events are reportedly gnawing worrywarts in New Delhi: Nepalese troops taking part in a joint military drill in China; China granting Nepal access to seven Chinese trading ports; In Bhutan, pro-India ruling party failing in the first round of polls in the general election. The first is worrying perhaps because it was held days after Kathmandu withdrew from a major joint military exercise in India. The second because such access may reduce Nepal's reliance on Indian ports. The third sounds a little too weird, with some in India speculating one of the two candidates in the second round may seek to forge ties with China. The reason: he met with the Chinese premier in 2012 as prime minister of Bhutan. Some Indian observers are so nervous that they are warning about their country's two immediate neighbors distancing themselves from New Delhi and embracing Beijing. They are worrying too much. The China-Nepal joint military drill is for anti-terrorism and disaster management purposes. Access to Chinese trading ports, while diversifying Nepal's trading route options, does not necessarily mean net loss for India. A more robust Nepalese economy will further boost trading links with India. Bhutan, as a sovereign state, knows where it stands, and has balanced itself quite well - between China and India. Nepal and Bhutan have not only maintained traditional closeness with India, but also maneuvered a balance in relations with their other neighbor. This is consistent with Chinese foreign policy on neighboring countries. That's why despite the absence of diplomatic ties, Bhutan and China have been on good terms. Some people in New Delhi may have difficulty accepting the two countries developing better relations with China. However, aside from whether their country is in a position to dictate other countries' diplomatic preferences, it is unfair to blame their own ""diplomatic failure"" on Beijing, an uninvolved party. Rumors have linked Nepal's withdrawal from a joint drill with India to a two-month economic blockade by New Delhi in 2015, ostensibly because of Nepal's attempt to amend its Constitution. The pro-India candidate lost in the Bhutan election possibly because India withdrew fuel subsidies, allegedly to punish Bhutan for that 2012 meeting. Beijing has never concealed its enthusiasm about its Belt and Road Initiative, and welcomes all countries to participate in and benefit from the connectivity project. The question is: Do other countries need India's consent to take part in it? The editor of a Bhutanese newspaper has reportedly asked the Indian media and decision-makers to avoid excessive bigotry and suspicion. Which sounds like good advice.         "
A simple message from China on US for the world to heed: China Daily editorial,9/19/2018,"                                             That Premier Li Keqiang has called on the international community to uphold the basic principles of multilateralism and free trade should make the Donald Trump administration realize how strong is China's resolve to fight trade protectionism. Addressing the participants at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin on Wednesday, Li emphasized that trade disputes should be resolved through consultation, not confrontation. Coming a day after China was forced to impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods in response to the US imposing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, Li's statement should remind the US that the tariff war will not resolve any of the issues at stake. The US-ignited trade conflicts with its trade partners have already caused turbulence in many countries' markets, dampened investor confidence, and risks disrupting the healthy global recovery. Without a viable solution to the trade problem in sight, global business leaders and investors would become even more obsessed with the ramifications of any more unilateral and protectionist moves by the Trump administration, which seems inclined to use forceful and irrational measures, such as tariff hikes, to get its way. The fact that the Trump administration has threatened to impose higher tariffs on more Chinese goods if China responds in kind to its latest tariff hike has left global investors increasingly worried and added more uncertainties to global trade prospects. Judging by postwar economic history, multilateralism and cooperation are the most effective solutions to the world's rising economic and financial problems. Thanks to the World Trade Organization and the more recent G20 regime, the world was in a better position to cope with major trade and economic problems till the US began its protectionist moves. Indeed, the close cooperation among major economies helped put an end to the financial turmoil and economic meltdown brought about by the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Protectionism may look beneficial to certain industries and vested interests, at least in the short term. But in long run, protectionism is bound to be detrimental to the overall industrial and economic competitiveness of the country resorting to it, affecting its economic health while jeopardizing the interests of other countries. As such, the global community has no choice but to condemn the US' beggar-thy-neighbor policy and counter its protectionist moves.         "
More needs to be done despite summit success: China Daily editorial,9/19/2018,"                                                 ROK President Moon Jae-in and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un shake hands after signing documents during the inter-Korean summit at the Paekhwawon State Guesthouse in Pyongyang, in this still frame taken from video Sept 19, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The optics was fine and the sound bites heartening.  Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in delivered exactly what they were expected to.  They announced a key document on eliminating mutual military threat, a substantial follow-up to the historic April 27 joint declaration vowing to stop all kinds of hostile acts.  They proposed to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games.  And they reached an agreement on Kim visiting the ROK, along with other measures to broaden and deepen constructive engagement.  The most significant part of Wednesday's joint declaration to other stakeholders, though, is its Article V, which vows to ""turn the Peninsula into a land of peace free of nuclear weapons and nuclear threats, and for that purpose make substantial progress as soon as possible"".  To substantiate Pyongyang's sincerity, the document does go one step further, offering to ""permanently deactivate and abandon"" another key engine test and missile launcher facility. Aside from that unilateral, unconditional offer, it also highlights ""additional measures"" like permanently discarding nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, on condition that Washington ""takes corresponding measures"".  The third Kim-Moon summit was more like a bifurcation than a turning point. Although US President Donald Trump has welcomed the development and indicated negotiations with Pyongyang may get back on track, anything can happen moving forward.  But the Kim-Moon summit in Pyongyang did indicate one thing: inter-Korean rapport may develop faster, with the denuclearization process moving in tandem but on a slower track. Not that thawing Pyongyang-Seoul ties does not help denuclearization. They are a precondition for the latter. Yet they do not suffice for the latter to materialize.  Clause II, Article V of the Pyongyang joint declaration reiterates the DPRK's already clear position that the ball is now in the US' court, and the prospect of denuclearization is contingent on the latter's response.  If Washington insists suspending some high-profile exercises alone is a qualified response and show of goodwill, substantial progress may be difficult to achieve for the time being.  Although the new joint declaration does not clarify what constitutes ""corresponding measures"", it does hint at something better. In earlier appeals to Washington, Pyongyang had asked for formal termination of the Korean War, the state of war to be more precise.  Considering the symbolic nature of the lingering state of war on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the substantial moves Pyongyang is to make in return, Washington ought to give it a serious thought.  In the mean time, Seoul may want to push both parties harder to achieve greater progress on denuclearization, because inter-Korean rapport cannot go too far without addressing such a broader international concern.

Japan's actions belie its claim to improve ties: China Daily editorial,9/17/2018,"                                             That Japan dispatched a submarine to join other Japanese warships in a drill in the South China Sea has certainly raised tensions in the region, especially as the drill, the first Japanese exercise of its kind, was held in the waters south of China's Huangyan Island on Thursday. The Japanese move came a couple of weeks after a British Royal Navy warship, HMS Albion, sailed close to China's Xisha Islands in the South China Sea in what Britain claimed was a freedom of navigation operation, triggering a strong protest from China for violating its maritime sovereignty. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force's provocative action has also cast doubts on Tokyo's sincerity to improve relations with Beijing at a time when Japan is making preparations for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's possible visit to China. Bilateral ties suffered a severe setback when Japan ""nationalized"" China's Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea six years ago. Since then relations remained somewhat frosty until the beginning of this year, when Japan appeared eager to improve bilateral relations. Following the visits of several Japanese officials to China, Premier Li Keqiang paid an official visit to Japan in May, when the two sides vowed to further improve China-Japan relations. Since the process did not come by easily, Japan should be sensitive to China's national and security issues. For that, Japan must see China as a cooperative partner, not a threat as it does now. In particular, Japan should exercise extreme caution when it comes to China's islands in the South China Sea, as it had illegally occupied them during World War II, before China reclaimed them. Japan has already assumed the right to exercise ""collective self-defense"" and engage in military action if one of its allies were attacked. Added to this, Abe's attempts to revise Article 9 of Japan's pacifist Constitution to exercise the right to use force to settle international disputes does not augur well for Japan's neighbors given Japan's wartime past. The fact that Japan and like-minded countries have ignored the attempts of China and ASEAN member states to settle their disputes in the South China Sea makes their intentions suspect. Japan is not a party to any of the disputes in the South China Sea. Therefore, it should adopt policies that would promote peace in the region so that the ships of all countries can safely sail through the South China Sea, rather than using freedom of navigation as an excuse to enhance its military presence in the region.

US move before Pyongyang meeting raises concerns: China Daily editorial,9/17/2018,"                          ROK President Moon Jae-in, right, meets with top leader of the DPRK Kim Jong-un in the border village of Panmunjom on April, 27, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The third summit between the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea is another sign that, despite the apparent diplomatic standstill between Pyongyang and Washington, things remain on track between the Koreas.  As long as this momentum is maintained, hopes for broader detente on the Korean Peninsula will remain high. And if this is the yardstick for assessing the third summit between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, there is little reason for it to not succeed.  Since DPRK leader Kim Jong-un and ROK President Moon Jae-in signed the Panmunjom Joint Declaration on April 27, relations between the Koreas have proceeded generally smoothly according to that script. Moon's ongoing visit to Pyongyang, like his meeting with Kim, is also part of that historic agreement.  Article II of the Joint Declaration vows to ease military tensions and eliminate risks of war through joint efforts, and by agreeing to cease ""all kinds of hostile acts"" on land, sea, and in the air. Carrying this spirit forward, Moon said on Thursday that ""bringing an end"" to accidental skirmishes and lingering tensions is his top priority.  Pyongyang is equally eager for closer engagement with Seoul, and stated in its earlier message to Washington that it wants an official end to the Korean War in exchange for moving further toward denuclearization.  And through their reportedly 17-hour-long talks on Thursday, meant to pave way for the summit, the two sides' militaries ""confirmed each other's positions on what should be included in the agreement and adjusted the wording concerning the relevant document"", the ROK Defense Ministry said.  But while the two Koreas have maintained the momentum set at their historic summit in April, permanent peace cannot be restored on the peninsula without the involvement of the United States, which suddenly called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday to deal with what it claimed are efforts by some countries to ""undermine and obstruct"" the sanctions against the DPRK.  The US calling an emergency Security Council meeting on the eve of the Kim-Moon summit cannot be a mere coincidence. However, the Kim-Moon summit, if it takes the peace agenda forward, could offset the impact of any adverse outcome of the UN Security Council meeting.  But lasting peace goes far beyond any inter-Korean arrangement. It includes, among others things, a breakthrough in denuclearization. And Moon will likely propose a compromise solution to denuclearization at his meeting with Kim, which could become a turning point in the Korean Peninsula peace process. However, it will succeed only if the US formally embraces it.         "
Spying will take island authorities nowhere,9/16/2018,"                          An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, speaks at a press conference in Beijing, Sept 12, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Cross-Straits relations have not been good since the incumbent administration  assumed power, making compatriots on both sides of the Straits worried. This is the reality of the situation, and Taiwan should know any more attempts to foment trouble will only worsen the situation and raise tensions across the Straits.More than anything else, the Taiwan authorities should not forget the fact that the island will never be allowed to secede from the motherland. So if the island leaders cannot do something to improve the current situation, they should desist from wangling people into situations that would force the Chinese mainland to take action.More than 100 spying cases involving Taiwan residents have been cracked, says a Ministry of State Security release. Some Taiwan spies even laid honey traps for mainland students studying or visiting the island to extract information out of them.The exchange of students between universities across the Straits not only promotes the academic exchanges between the two sites, but also helps develop a bond between the students and youths. But the spying scandal has cast a shadow over such exchange programs.More important, the huge numbers of spying cases and Taiwan spies involved suggest the Taiwan authorities harbor the intention of seeking Taiwan “independence”.However, they have underestimated the mainland’s resolve to maintain national integrity, and failed to realize that the more they try to disrupt cross-Straits ties, the more determined the mainland will be to seek national reunification through whatever means possible.The island authorities might want to believe they can use the support of the United States as a counterbalance to the mainland’s resolve. But the US State Department’s latest decision to reject the proposal of sending US marines to Taiwan flies in the face of the island authorities. Washington will only use Taiwan as pawn against Beijing to play its geopolitical games without actually helping the island.So the island authorities would do good to realize that maintaining amicable cross-Straits relations is in the best interest of Taiwan economy and its residents, as well as mainland residents. And if they cannot improve the situation, they should not use spies against the mainland and make an already bad situation worse.In short, the Taiwan leaders should stop employing spies to lay their hands on the classified information from the mainland and trying Beijing’s patience.            "
Healthy development of private economy essential: China Daily editorial,9/13/2018,"                                             Despite people's growing immunity to outlandish claims of self-declared ""experts"", when an article by a ""veteran financial industry insider"" appeared online the other day, the impact was seismic.  Not because there was any unusual revelation, or anything worth a fuss, but mostly because of its eye-catching headline: ""Chinese private economy has fulfilled its mission to assist development of the public economy, and should gradually fade out"".  Though few people have read the article in its entirety, or even bothered to find it online, the viral, reposted screenshot highlighting that sensational headline alone was enough to take many aback.  Given the sensitivity of the issue and its significance to the development of the world's second-largest economy, there have been mixed reactions to it, from denouncement to speculation on whether it is a trial balloon hinting at new policy orientations.  Had the official Economic Daily not reacted, laying bare its fundamental logical fallacy and contradiction with national policies, and the People's Daily not endorsed it immediately, it would have been extremely difficult to contain the spread of the contagious fear of an unprecedented policy reversal.  The two authoritative newspapers' timely clarification was of critical importance, because there indeed is the need to reiterate the national leadership's unchanged faith in the positive role of the private sector and continuing commitment to its prosperity at such a tricky juncture.  The controversial article was misleading not only because it under-appreciated the invaluable and indispensable role private enterprises have played in China's economic development, but also because it ignored the vital fact that they outshine the mammoth yet less efficient State-owned enterprises in contribution to gross national product, job creation, absorption of laborers transferred from the countryside, newly added jobs, and taxation.  In particular, it goes against our Constitution, whose Article 11 defines nonpublic economies as ""important components of the socialist market economy"", and promises to ""encourage, support and guide"" their development.  Successfully averting a potentially dangerous public opinion crisis does not mean everything will since be fine. There would not have been any confusion were it not for society's growing anxiety over the difficult condition some private companies are in now and the broad concerns about their difficulty in getting financial assistance.  That means we need concrete measures to create a fair and open environment for the sustainable and healthy development of the private economy, and to consolidate the confidence of entrepreneurs.

"As the only right choice, trade talks welcome: China Daily editorial",9/13/2018,"                                             The US' invitation to China to restart trade talks suggests the Donald Trump administration has changed its idea about settling trade disputes. But the decision is more likely based on its realization that the damage inflicted on domestic industries and consumers by the Trump-ignited tariff war would become unbearable, so it's better to use nondestructive means to settle the trade disputes with China.  If that is the case, the US move holds promise. But this promise could be deceptive.While announcing that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had sent the invite to senior Chinese officials, Larry Kudlow, White House's top economic adviser, said on Wednesday: ""I think most of us think it's better to talk than not to talk, and I think the Chinese government is willing to talk.""  But then came the rider, as Kudlow said: ""I guarantee nothing.""  It is indeed rare for a responsible official to issue such a caution. Especially, after the Aug 22-23 talks between midlevel Chinese and US officials ended without any agreements.  After imposing high tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, the United States threatened to slap tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese imports. If that too did not force China to accept its demands, the US said, it would make preparations to impose high tariffs on an additional $267 billion of Chinese goods.  But then suddenly the US administration changed tack. Perhaps the opposition of a large number of US enterprises to the high tariffs on imports at the late August public hearings on the Section 301 tariff list prompted the Trump administration to reconsider its unilateral and protectionist tariff policies.  According to an AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai survey covering more than 430 US companies operating in China, most of the respondents said the Sino-US trade friction would have a far-reaching negative impact on their businesses, with rising costs being their top concern.China's stance has always been consistent. It knows full well talks are the best and only way to resolve bilateral disputes. Still, it will not hesitate to take countermeasures against US tariffs to safeguard China's interests.  China welcomes and, more importantly, is serious about the trade talks. And it would like to believe the Trump administration is equally serious about resolving the trade disputes through talks.  But the Trump administration should not be mistaken that China will surrender to the US demands. It has enough fuel to drive its economy even if a trade war is prolonged.         "
China Daily editorial: Is an evil design at play to malign the CPEC?,9/12/2018,"                      It has been hailed as a good example of strategic cooperative partnership between two countries to promote shared economic development. Yet a recent Financial Times report claims the new Pakistani government has decided to re-evaluate the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and renegotiate its terms, as it is ""unfairly"" beneficial to Chinese companies at the cost of their Pakistani counterparts. The report, citing interviews with Pakistani ministers and advisers, may sound sensational enough. But it falls short on accuracy and objectivity. The professional standards the newspaper has been known for is unfortunately missing in the vanilla kind of report. As a matter of fact, soon after its publication, the Pakistani officials who were interviewed trashed the report saying their comments had been taken ""out of context"" and intentionally distorted to suit the preconceived notion of the editorial staff. The CPEC, a key part of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, as a high-ranking Pakistani official said, is the economic future of Pakistan, and it will not compromise the country's national security or interests. The economic corridor has injected much-needed vitality into Pakistan's economy. Of the 22 infrastructure and energy projects under the CPEC framework, nine have been completed, increasing Pakistan’s economic growth by 1 to 2 percentage points a year, and creating tens of thousands of jobs for the local people. True, Pakistan's new government has set up a nine-member committee to re-evaluate the CPEC, but not to renegotiate the terms but to help strengthen and expedite the construction of the corridor and provide more benefits for the people in Pakistan. Ignoring these facts to only claim the CPEC is part of China's ambitious plan to extend its geopolitical influence is at best obtuseness and at worst an evil design to drive a wedge between the two all-weather friends. Similar evil designs have been at work to delay or disrupt the development projects involving China in some other countries. Perhaps such attempts are part of a larger game plan to malign the projects China has proposed to promote shared economic development. And if that is the case, there is a need for China and its partner countries, including its neighbors, to take Western media reports on development projects with a pinch of salt. Attempts to find loopholes where none exists do not help any cause, least of all the cause of shared economic development. But whether the West, Western media, in particular, will accept this fact is anybody's guess.         "
Western media's view on religion blurs reality: China Daily editorial,9/12/2018,"                      Should religious activities on the internet be regulated? This question has gained importance for multiple reasons, not least because of the impostors and extremists masquerading as holy saints online. With the boom of social media, religion has become an easy channel for some people to propagate their doctrines, nefarious and illegal, in the name of religion, even organize sects that could pose a threat to social stability and national security. No social activity should be allowed to ride roughshod over the law. Religion is no exception. And in nearly all countries there exists a legal boundary for the practice of religion. But surprisingly, when it comes to religious practice in China, Western observers and media outlets always tend to veer toward the view that religious freedom is restricted. The fact is, the Constitution of China grants every citizen the right to freedom of religious belief. But since some use religion as a guise to cheat unsuspecting individuals out of their money, lead people up the garden path in the name of religion, or commit other crimes, such as pyramid selling, the Constitution prevents the use of religion for disrupting public order, committing frauds, impairing the health of citizens or interfering with the education system. No individual should infringe upon the rights of another using religious practice as a pretext. This principle, in some form of the other, is adhered to by almost all governments. But it is the coveted wish of some Western media outlets to see China free of any regulation on religious activities, even if frauds and religious extremists use the internet to cheat innocent people, lead them astray and create social chaos and security problems. For instance, the Heaven’s Gate cult in San Diego, California, enticed followers into committing mass suicide in the 1990s in the hope of reaching an ""extraterrestrial spacecraft"" following Comet Hale-Bopp. Shouldn’t there be a law to prevent such cults from becoming a threat to society, especially in this age of social media? And that’s exactly what China has done by issuing a draft regulation for monitoring and managing religious activities online, so as to protect the rights and legal interests of Chinese citizens. Lest it be mistaken as a tool to restrict religious practices, the draft regulation is aimed at preventing religious charlatans from using the internet to corrupt innocent minds and pollute the social environment.

US fires yet another salvo at the world order: China Daily editorial,9/11/2018,"                                                 An outside view of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Washington, USA, Sept 10, 2018. [Photo/IC]   Giving another example of its diplomatic audacity and scorn for international law, the Donald Trump administration has threatened to arrest and sanction judges of the International Criminal Court if they move to charge any US personnel who served in Afghanistan with war crimes.  The threat on Monday came along with the US State Department order to shut down the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington over US concerns that the Palestinians might prompt an ICC investigation against Israel for alleged war crimes.  The Hague-based court's mandate is to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Many media reports say prisoners in Afghanistan have been abused and tortured by US forces, which was corroborated by a US federal judge ruling in 2015 which asked Washington to release photographs showing the abuse of detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Perhaps this is what triggered the United States' bellicose attack on the ICC.  Yet the ICC's probe, if it has planned one, into US personnel and intelligence professionals would not be ""utterly unfounded, unjustifiable"", as White House National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed. Justice was definitely not on Bolton's mind when he threatened to let the ICC ""die on its own"", as it is clear that he questioned the ICC's legitimacy only because it is not playing by the rules set by Washington.  The attack against the ICC belies the US' self-proclaimed role as the high priest of human rights.  Ironically, just years ago the US wholeheartedly supported the court's investigation into alleged human rights abuse in countries such as Sudan and Uganda - because it served its purpose.  The move, with its disturbing signs, should be seen as Trump's designs to overhaul the existing world order and establish a new one to better serve his ""America First"" policy. The ""art of the deal"" that Trump never tires bragging about, which in essence is a constricted view of the world, has already prompted the US to pull out of many international institutions and multilateral pacts, from the UN Human Rights Council and the Paris climate agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.  It is therefore highly doubtful whether this in-your-face attitude of the Trump administration will serve US interests in the long term. Not least because it is against the overwhelming global trend of peace development.         "
Speculations over forum and drill uncalled for: China Daily editorial,9/11/2018,"                                                 Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives at Vladivostok, Russia for the fourth Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sept 11, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   That China and Russia should work more closely together to fight protectionism has become even more important given the unilateral approach of some to resolve international issues. Emphasizing this fact after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the 4th Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping said that an increasingly volatile geopolitical climate has made the China-Russia partnership a necessity.  This special closeness between China and Russia may be more conspicuous in the unprecedented scale of Chinese presence in Russia's largest post-Cold War military drill, ""East-2018"".  But the fact that the drill coincides with the Vladivostok forum has prompted wild speculations over its nature and purpose. Are pressures from Washington again driving Beijing and Moscow into a military alliance? What's the message the two intend to send through it? Will there be a new Cold War?  Yet these speculations seem baseless. While Beijing and Moscow disagree extensively with Washington on a broad spectrum of shared concerns, Xi and Putin are availing of the forum to demonstrate there are more constructive, and rewarding, ways to use Sino-Russian partnership.  Themed ""The Far East: Expanding the Range of Possibilities"", the three-day event in Vladivostok, which also brings together leaders of Japan and the Republic of Korea along with attendees from dozens of other countries, highlights a potential new growth point for Russia, China, the region at large, and all stakeholders.  The leaders' meetings in Vladivostok will facilitate information sharing and consensus building on matters such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, especially because the hopes raised by the detente between Washington and Pyongyang appear to be fading.  But the forum is aimed at building a new platform to anchor and integrate many of Northeast Asia's development agendas. As a result, Russia's Far East development program and China's efforts to revive its northeastern rust belt seem like a match made in heaven.  For long Russia has been trying to develop its Far East, which accounts for more than one-third of its territory. But the lack of adequate input has made the task difficult.  With proper input, the sparsely populated yet resource-rich region could inject precious vitality into the Russian economy. This is where the manufacturing prowess and agricultural skills of China's northeastern provinces could be of great help. And proper intergovernmental agreements, especially financing from Beijing, will ensure the joint development projects bring about instant changes to the local economic landscape across the border.  Beijing is Moscow's natural, and so far the largest, partner in developing Russia's vast Far East, and proper investor support and protection mechanisms will further boost this collaboration.

Washington's homeshoring call set to fall on deaf ears: China Daily editorial,9/10/2018,"                      US President Donald Trump has urged automaker Ford and electronics giant Apple to shift their production from China to the United States to avoid the impact of the administration's high tariffs on Chinese imports. While it sounds like a plausible and workable solution, it goes against the trend of global division of labor that has been in place for many decades, and is set to fail.  The world has witnessed a major shift in industrial production over the past decades from high-cost advanced economies, such as the United States, to the low-cost developing countries, such as China, a process that has benefited both the investing multinationals and the receiving countries.  Such a market-driven rearrangement of the global industrial landscape has played an important role in pushing global economic growth and improving the well-being of people in both developed and developing economies.  Now the Trump administration, by imposing hefty import tariffs, is seeking to reverse that process. But it has failed to appreciate that it cannot buck market forces. Even though they would be exempt from the high tariffs, by shifting their production back to the US, companies such as Ford and Apple would have to shoulder much higher production costs.  That is why Ford stated that it won't move back its production because ""it would not be profitable"".  Apple is yet to respond to the president's suggestion. But it is highly likely its calculations will come to the same conclusion.  What Trump and his fellow neo-firsters should do is to reflect on the adverse impact of its tariff policies on the interests of US enterprises and citizens, as those policies will, instead of forcing China to give in, only hike the costs of imports, thus dampening sales of goods produced by US companies in China and raising the prices of daily necessities for US consumers.  Such policies are set to trigger strong opposition from not only its trade partners but its own companies and people, as shown by the results of the US Trade Representative hearings on its proposed tariffs on a further $200 billion worth of Chinese products.  If it refuses to redress its one-sided policies and carries out its tariff threat, the administration will only further damage the interests of US companies and increase the financial burden of ordinary US people.  Sometimes, you just have to admit what seemed like a good idea at the time really wasn't, especially when it comes back to bite you.         "
"Better Xinjiang security boosts safety, tourism: China Daily editorial",9/10/2018,"                          Women dressed in colorful outfits perform at the 27th Silk Road Turpan Grape Festival in Turpan, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Sept 3, 2018. [Photo provided to Chinadaily.com.cn]   Should there be tight security that leaves no space for extremism and terrorism or lax security in the name of freedom? This is a question that has become pertinent to many countries today given the risks of terrorist attacks. In the United States and Europe, citizens have chosen the former. Likewise in China.  Not least in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region where most residents - along with the majority of Chinese people in other parts of China - have put safety first. However, it seems those working for Human Rights Watch disagree.  That explains why, despite tourists who have visited the region saying they felt safe, it has called for sanctions on China, pointing a finger at the government's strict security measures in the region.  Tightened security, which has greatly squeezed the room for possible attacks by terrorists and extremists without restricting people's freedom of religious belief, has undoubtedly contributed to the boom in tourism in the region. Tourism has reached a historical high with 50 million tourists visiting the region so far this year. It should go without saying that the boom in tourism is bringing real benefits to the local economy and local residents.  For local residents of various ethnicities who want nothing else but a peaceful life, there is no reason for them not to welcome the tight security given the previous violent incidents in the region.  There may be tightened security checks in such key areas as airports or railway stations. It is quite possible and natural that some who are suspected of being involved in terrorist or extremist activities should be detained subject to further investigation.  However, if one looks through a microscope, it is not difficult to enlarge a minor defect into a big problem while ignoring the big picture.  This is what Human Rights Watch has done. As an onlooker, it does not and will never know the security concerns of the majority of Xinjiang residents, and neither does it appreciate how extremism and terrorism have disrupted the normal lives of local residents and harmed the local economy.  Tight security is the right and only choice for the government to rid Xinjiang of extremism and terrorism. The region's booming tourism industry and reviving economy are testament to that.         "
Military success in Syria does not mean end of the crisis: China Daily editorial,9/9/2018,"                          Missile fire is seen from Damascus, Syria, May 10, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   As Syrian and Russian forces press ahead with what they believe is to be a decisive strike on Idlib, the last bastion of terrorists and rebel forces in Syria, voices have become louder warning of ""the worst humanitarian disaster in the nation's seven-year civil war"".  ""There are more babies in Idlib than there are terrorists,"" the British ambassador to the United Nations told the United Nations Security Council. Her US counterpart called the ongoing assault ""a playbook of death"".  Even Turkish President Recep Erdogan, who endorsed a ""phased stabilization plan"" for war-torn Syria with Iranian and Russian presidents Friday in Tehran, voiced opposition, warning it ""will result in a disaster, massacre and a big humanitarian tragedy"".  It is obvious the Syria government forces' final victory against the rebels and terrorist groups are the last thing the US wants to see as it will mean its loss to both Russia and Syrian leader Bashar Assad whom the US has been trying to topple.  While amassing a battle-ready military presence nearby, United States troops have launched a surprise exercise, sending a strong warning signal.  The offensive will proceed anyway, until reports of a fresh chemical weapons attack breaks. Considering the lingering questions surrounding the previous chemical weapons-related allegations, no twist and turn may be surprising going forward. Reports of chemical weapons use are the sole proven trigger for direct military intervention by the West.  It would be well if all sides could heed the words of China's UN representative who has appealed for restraint by all parties.  Conflicts in the area have rarely been free of outsider involvement. Those in Syria are particularly complicated because they are not only attached to various parties' immediate wins or losses on the battlefields, but also contradicting geopolitical pursuits.  Despite its inability to realize regime change through military means, the United States is not ready to tolerate the Syrian government and Russia's final military victory on the battlefields. It would rather see a Syria split between Assad and the opposition forces.  The tripartite Tehran summit was correct at least on one point – ""there can be no military solution"" to the war in Syria. The Idlib offensive, even it ends with the kind of expected military success, will be anything but conclusive.  Just as the Friday summit did not produce a clear roadmap for ending the civil-war for the absence of the Syrian government and opposition factions, any postwar political arrangements will prove problematic without consensuses being reached among broader stakeholders.

Meddling in China's affair violates norms: China Daily editorial,9/9/2018,"                          Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (R) and Salvadorean Foreign Minister Carlos Castaneda sign a joint communique in Beijing, capital of China, August 21, 2018.[Photo/Xinhua]   In a show of the power politics -  that it is quick to lambast others for - the United States said on Friday it had recalled its top diplomats in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama over those countries' decisions to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The move was preceded by US senators' introducing legislation on Wednesday that would authorize the State Department to downgrade US relations with any government that shifts away from Taiwan.  By resorting to coercion in this way, in the hope that those countries that still maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan will be deterred from shifting diplomatic recognition to the Chinese mainland, Washington is showing that it has no respect for the norms of international relations.  It is also blatantly trying to intervene in a matter that is the domestic jurisdiction of another sovereign nation, proving that nothing is stronger than habit, since this has become one of Washington's favorite pastimes.  To see this for the ill-intentioned meddling it is, one only has to look at the joint Sino-US communiqué issued on Dec 16, 1978, which states the US ""recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China"".  Washington claims its move is because China has been enticing countries to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing with economic inducements. However, the truth always surfaces above lies, and this has been rejected by those countries concerned as ""base and totally false"".  By switching diplomatic ties Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama have aligned themselves with the historical truth that there is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it.  This is the consensus of the international community. It is also the fundamental prerequisite and political foundation for China to establish and develop relations with any country, and as the presidential spokesman of El Salvador said after the country switched its diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taipei last month, ""We cannot turn our back on the world, ignore that China is the second-largest power in the world and the leading export economy on the planet ...""  In trying to bully those countries that still have ""diplomatic relations"" with Taipei from correcting their historical mistake, Washington is playing them as expendable pawns in its geopolitical games, and sending a dangerous signal to the Tsai Ing-wen administration, encouraging it to walk further and further, along a dangerous road.  Washington and Taipei should not get so wrapped up in their game that they forget the risks.         "

Reciprocation now key to Korean Peninsula peace: China Daily editorial,9/6/2018,"                                                 ROK President Moon Jae-in (right) and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un. [Photo/IC]   It is always good to hear Pyongyang vow to denuclearize. Even better when it comes with a timeline.  Both happened on Wednesday, when an envoy of Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in met with Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Such a dramatic turnaround will surely rekindle hopes after the United States president canceled a planned visit by his secretary of state to Pyongyang citing lack of progress.  That move by Donald Trump, along with his complaint about Beijing allegedly being less cooperative, significantly dented the optimism that had followed his meeting with Kim in Singapore.  But with ""practical measures"" toward denuclearization reportedly on the agenda for the meeting between Kim and Moon due to take place in Pyongyang on Sept 18-20, and Moon's envoy reportedly relaying messages between Trump and Kim, there are grounds for renewed optimism.  After all, people have generally anticipated the opposite following Trump's decision, to which Pyongyang had responded with anger.  Yet this in no way means denuclearization will be a smooth and rapid process. Pyongyang's latest promise, like its previous moves to nullify a nuclear test ground and dismantle missile launchers, is not unconditional.  Reportedly frustrated over ""doubt shown by some parts of the international society about his will"", this is the DPRK leader's latest message that he is serious about denuclearization. But Kim has again indicated he is waiting for his ""good faith"" to be ""accepted with good faith"". According the ROK envoy, he is ready to roll out ""more active measures"" toward denuclearization when he sees ""reciprocation"".  While Washington insists suspending the US-ROK joint military exercises qualifies as reciprocation. Pyongyang wants an official end to the 1951-53 Korean War.  Given this, what happens next is more likely to be continuing bargaining over who is to give what, and when, rather than any concrete actions.  In order for the parties' rhetoric about reciprocation and denuclearization to deliver outcomes in the real world, Seoul, in its middleman's role, has a lot to do to first bridge the conspicuous perception and expectation gaps between Pyongyang and Washington.  The outcomes of the latest exchange of messages between Trump and Kim, and whether they lead to any new developments ahead of the inter-Korean summit will likely indicate whether Kim's timeline of denuclearization within this presidential term is realizable.

UK should try to have more than one friend: China Daily editorial,9/6/2018,"                                             In what the Foreign Ministry described on Thursday as a ""provocative"" move that has infringed on China's sovereignty and violated Chinese and international laws, a British Royal Navy warship entered Chinese territorial waters around the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea on August 31, triggering strong complaints from China.  A British Navy spokesman claimed that the HMS Albion, a 22,000-ton amphibious warship on its way to Vietnam from Japan, was conducting a ""freedom of navigation operation"". It is not the first time a British warship has entered Chinese waters under this pretext.  And it is a pretext, as freedom of navigation in the South China Sea has never been a problem. Hundreds of thousands of commercial ships pass through the strategic waterway each year transporting an estimated $5 trillion worth of goods. Not a single one has found its freedom of navigation compromised.  Despite their maritime disputes, China and other regional countries are making progress on agreeing a code of conduct for the waters, and the situation has remained stable thanks to their joint efforts to enhance cooperation and mutual trust.  It is the continuous provocative maneuvers by navies from outside the region that have escalated tensions and threatened the stability and endangered maritime safety in the South China Sea.  There is no international law that justifies even ""innocent passage"" of a foreign country's military vessels through other's territorial waters without permission. The reckless actions by the British navy to challenge China's sovereignty can only be explained by the country wanting to curry favor with the United States. The US has often grumbled that its allies have been remiss in not following its lead in conducting ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea. Now that it is eyeing the US as an economic lifeline after it exits the European Union — the United Kingdom is no doubt eager to seize whatever opportunity it can to get into Washington's good books.  But by trying to revive the ""special relationship"" in this way now it is no longer the gateway to continental Europe, the UK risks losing more than it can gain.  China and the UK had agreed to actively explore the possibility of discussing a free trade agreement after Brexit, but any act that harms China's core interests will only put a spanner in the works.  During her visit to Beijing early this year, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to intensify ""the golden era"" of Sino-UK relations. To achieve that, the country should refrain from being Washington's sharksucker in the South China Sea.         "
HK campuses must not tolerate the impermissible:  China Daily editorial,9/5/2018,"                                                 Hong Kong celebrates the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland with a flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square on July 1, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   Hong Kong separatists reared their heads on university campuses again in the past week, one year after separatist banners on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong provoked widespread condemnation in the special administrative region last September.  Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, condemned the student union leaders at some local universities after they greeted their teachers and fellow students on the first day of the new academic year with speeches filled with separatist references.  Attacking those using the university events as a platform to promote an ""absurd"" idea, she said that those advocating independence were violating the Basic Law and that anything ""that impacts the basic policy direction of 'one country, two systems' or the 'bottom line' mentioned by President Xi Jinping on July 1 last year — we will not tolerate"", referring to the red line he drew for relations between the mainland and Hong Kong at a gathering to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.  Any attempt to endanger national sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government and the authority of the Basic Law crosses a red line, and is ""absolutely impermissible"", he said.  On Wednesday, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Huang Liuquan reemphasized the central government's zero-tolerance stance toward Hong Kong separatism.  Two decades after Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, no one should have any doubt about the constitutional reality of Hong Kong — separatism is simply a non-issue in any rational discussion.  That campuses have been repeatedly exploited by attention seekers raising banners for ""independence"" is unfair on the majority of students, who expect them to be places of study and research.  University administrators, while they may not wish to be considered to be using a heavy hand, should take effective measures to stop any advocacy of separatism on campus as they have a duty to uphold the Basic Law and create an environment for learning.

Nauru's ugly forum farce against trend of times: China Daily editorial,9/5/2018,"                                                 The 18-nation Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Yaren on the Pacific island of Nauru. [Photo/VCG]   The visa row between Nauru and diplomats from the Chinese mainland, while an ""ugly farce"", is little more than a storm in a teacup. However, it does reveal something significant that is of concern.  It was for political reasons that Nauru refused to stamp entry visas in Chinese diplomatic passports, saying it would only process their personal passports. This is because it has ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan, and it is for that reason the island country's president spoke ill of the Chinese delegation's bid to speak at the Pacific Islands Forum. The threat to boycott the forum by other Pacific island countries points to the inappropriateness of how Nauru treated the delegation from the Chinese mainland, which attended as an invited dialogue partner.  However, the bigger issue is the disconnect between the reality of China's presence in many parts of the world and the perceptions of it by some, as shown by Nauru claiming China is a big country that bullies small countries.  As the world's second-largest economy, it is natural for China to develop economic ties with other countries, big and small, and economic ties with China have brought tangible economic benefits to other countries, not least to island economies in the Pacific.  The trade volume between China and Pacific island countries was $8.2 billion in 2017, up from $7.5 billion the year before, of which $3.48 billion was imports from the Pacific island countries, an increase of 34.9 percent, according to statistics from China's Ministry of Commerce.  However, as China's economic strength continues to grow, some countries have started to look at China through tainted glasses, and make wild speculations about what ulterior motives China might have in boosting its economic relations with a particular country or region.  Some choose to distort the truth and describe China's economic cooperation as a means to extend its political influence and its assistance as bait with which to entrap countries.  Such claims go against the historical trend, which shows the positive contribution China has made to global development and growth over the past decades, as evidenced by the number of countries that are benefiting from economic cooperation with China.  People may be fooled for a moment, they can't be fooled forever.  Nauru's actions go against the common will of the Pacific island countries that is on the basis of the one-China principle, which is a general consensus of the international community.  Nauru's actions and name-calling simply show it is out of step with the times.         "
Region flies the flag for managing its own affairs: China Daily editorial,9/4/2018,"                                                 A photo of Chinese PLA navy fleet taken in April 2018. [Photo/VCG]   In a sign that Sino-Philippine relations are now resilient enough to withstand any unexpected incident, on Monday, the Philippine navy extricated one of its largest warships from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea where it ran aground last week.  There had been speculation that Manila was repeating an old trick and the BRP Gregorio del Pilar had been deliberately stranded on Half Moon Shoal, which China calls Banyue Jiao, as a Philippine navy vessel was deliberately grounded on Ren'ai Jiao in 1999, in an attempt to claim the sovereignty rights over the reef and its surrounding waters. Nearly 20 years have passed and the Philippines has yet to tow away the rusty ship, which it has been using as a military outpost.  Since then the Sino-Philippine relationship has been on something of a roller-coaster ride, hitting its nadir when the administration of Benigno Aquino III, encouraged by the United States, took a confrontational stance toward Beijing, and only coming back to the normal track after President Rodrigo Duterte took steps to answer Beijing's call to reset the strained ties after he took office in 2016.  As part of the two sides' efforts to build trust, they reached a consensus to maintain a ""sound and stable"" situation in the South China Sea. That is why Philippine defense officials notified their Chinese counterparts immediately after the accidental grounding of the frigate to avoid any misunderstanding, and why, in a show of goodwill, the Chinese Navy offered to help with its recovery.  China and other regional countries have been working together to maintain peace and security in the South China Sea, and the swift and amicable end to the incident has not allowed it to be played up by other countries seeking to drive a wedge between them.  By continually enhancing mutual trust and seeking to peacefully resolve their territorial disputes, countries in the region have turned a cold shoulder to those trying to stir up trouble in the waters.  At the end of June, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China agreed to move forward with negotiations on the proposed Code of Conduct in the South China Sea based on the framework they had agreed.  By handling this unexpected incident in a prompt and respectful way, the Philippines has shown that countries in the region can manage their differences, build trust, and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

"China, Africa on shared mission for better future: editorial",9/4/2018,"                                             ""Community with a shared future"" has become so prominent in Chinese diplomacy lately that it should come as no surprise that the 2018 summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation passed its Beijing declaration on Tuesday promising to build a ""closer China-Africa community with a shared future"".  China is not the only one making promises to Africa. But what is special about those from Beijing is, they are not made with the intention of imposing its will on African countries.  As he did in 2015, President Xi Jinping has earmarked $60 billion, including grants, interests-free and concessional loans, to support the 2019-21 action plan that was announced on Tuesday. Unlike other similar development aid programs extended to Africa, this assistance has no political strings attached. For as Xi said, China respects and supports Africa, as over the years it has proven to be ""a good friend, good partner and good brother"".  We have seen other similar development aid programs fall flat, and numerous pledges left unhonored, but Xi vowed China will do everything it can to help Africa alleviate poverty, pursue development, increase employment and income, and better the lives of its people.  And it is not just talk. In a show of good faith, Xi simultaneously wrote off inter-government interest-free debts due at year's end that are owed by the least developed and heavily indebted poor countries, as well as landlocked and small island developing countries in Africa that have diplomatic relations with China. Only the indebted countries themselves know how much that means to them.  If all this sounds too good to be true, if the idea of a ""China-Africa community of shared future"" sounds too abstract, then one only has to look at the full wording of the declaration's title to see that it is firmly grounded in the reality that both will benefit from strengthening their cooperation.  Close collaboration with African countries will not only lift the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership to new heights, it will also strengthen the cooperation of developing countries in pursuit of a fairer global governance system.  In doing so, China and Africa can demonstrate that a community with a shared future is not just a phrase, but the way ""to make the world a place of peace and stability and life happier and more fulfilling for all"".

"Trade, diplomacy are ways to make friends, not enemies: China Daily editorial",9/3/2018,"                                             While previous US administrations used trade deals as a way of promoting US influence around the world, trade was not the be-all and end-all of their foreign policy. The same cannot be said of the current administration as President Donald Trump has made trade the defining characteristic of his foreign policy. Whether it be through sanctions or tariffs, trade is being used as leverage for the populist ""America first"" strategy that propelled him through the White House door. The use of aggressive trade policies to achieve foreign policy objectives may make the US president feel more at ease, as it is deal-making in a manner he is used to, but it risks reducing complex issues to a ""you lose, I win"" proposition or else complicating them further. One only has to look at his conflating the trade dispute with China with his stalled engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to see how this has compounded both issues exponentially and by a large order of magnitude. Perhaps this is to be expected as his appeal has been built on the simple message of ""us versus them"", whether that be those in the swamp versus good people, or a battle of noble America against evil regimes. His policies, and his early exposure to the power of positive thinking, demand simple answers to difficult problems. If only life was so obliging. Making trade a means of persuasion for foreign policy objectives and vice versa may seem like a good idea to an administration that lacks diplomatic nous, but one can't help feeling that history has shown enough times it actually isn't that good a notion. Instead of getting bogged down in a nondeliverable strategy for exceptionalism that is damaging the US economy and leadership rather than enhancing them, the administration would do better to look at how trade and diplomacy are two means to connect with other countries and forge friendly and mutually beneficial relations. For example, the European Commission's decision not to extend the restrictions on imports of solar panels from China, which expired at midnight on Monday, has reset relations between the two sides and, as China's Ministry of Commerce said, is conducive to establishing a stable and predictable business environment. The Trump administration's coercion-based approach to trade and its reliance on it as a foreign policy tool have failed to pay dividends; perhaps it is time the people as shareholders of the nation demanded a change of approach.

West's bias not reflected in reality of African ties: China Daily editorial,9/3/2018,"                                                 Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, Sept 3, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   Every time Chinese leaders and their counterparts from across Africa meet for their summit, voices professing concern for African countries are heard in the West cautioning them about China's ""neocolonialism"".  This year, those attending the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which is being held in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday, have been serenaded by a choir of the concerned harping on the accusation that China is trapping African countries in debt.  Rather than reflecting the reality of Sino-African relations, this claim simply reflects the West's anxiety about China's rise and its concerns that the Belt and Road Initiative is a vehicle for extending Beijing's influence.  A report released by McKinsey & Company in June last year, concluded that no other country has such a depth and breadth of engagement with Africa as China, which had ""catapulted from being a small investor in Africa in 2000 to being its biggest economic partner"". However, to put that in context, China's $115 billion of credit to Africa between 2000 and 2016 makes up less than 2 percent of Africa's $6 trillion debt stock.  And as President Xi Jinping said on Monday, China-Africa cooperation under the framework of China's Belt and Road Initiative is intended to target the continent's major development bottlenecks so as to realize tangible benefits for both peoples.  That is why its assistance programs have been so successful as they directly address the needs of Africans. On a continent where more than 600 million people still have no access to electricity, 40 percent of the Chinese loans go for power generation and transmission. Another 30 percent seek to modernize Africa's transport infrastructure.  Rather than being debt trap diplomacy, as some in the West claim, Beijing's support for Africa seeks to realize benefits to the continent that can be both seen and felt and to promote the building of a Sino-African community with a shared future.  On Monday, having pledged $60 billion to Africa at the summit in South Africa three years ago, Xi offered another $60 billion in financing, promising Chinese investment comes with ""no political strings attached"". He also called on other countries not to set conditions on their assistance to African countries or to pursue political interests with their investments.  Despite Western criticism of China's presence in Africa, there is no denying the fact that the continent has maintained its growth momentum every year since China started to invest there. The Beijing summit shows that both sides want to maintain that momentum in pursuit of common prosperity.         "
"Kunshan findings uphold law, not a bow to public opinion",9/2/2018,"                          A screen shot from a video showing the knife attack in Kunshan, Jiangsu province. [Photo/IC]   After five days, the local police in Kunshan have announced the results of the investigation into the case of Yu Haiming, who, after being attacked and wounded by drunken driver Liu Hailong with a knife on Monday evening, fought back and killed his assailant. The police concluded that Yu's actions were ""justifiable self-defense"".  Surveillance video footage shows a BMW driven by Liu pulling into the bicycle lane to make a turn at some traffic lights and knocking Yu off his motorbike. During their subsequent altercation, Liu grabs a large knife from his car and attacks Yu. But he stumbles, and when the weapon falls from his hand and Yu is able to seize it and turn the tables on him  Posted on its public WeChat public account, the release by the local police was read millions of times. However, although public sympathy sided with Yu, it is wrong to treat this case as merely a ""victory of public opinion"". The local police and procuratorate have explained, in detail, how they investigated the incident: How did it begin? How many times did Liu stab Yu when he attacked him with the knife? How many times did Yu stab back when he managed to seize the knife when Liu dropped it while stumbling? Which wounds caused Liu's death? All these questions have clear and unambiguous answers.  In each of the steps, the local police and procuratorate strictly followed the law. They never sought to please public opinion.  Actually, the more attention the case received, the more cautious the police and procuratorate will be. It is wrong to believe the police will bend the law to suit public sentiment. Thus it is more proper to call the Kunshan case a victory for the rule of law which aligned with public demand for public order. The judiciary has interacted positively with the public, while the law has been strictly upheld.  It is also ""a victory"" because the local police and procuratorate have communicated the findings of their investigation and the reasoning behind their decision. They have also clearly explained which legal clauses apply to the case, and also made clear the background information of the persons involved, thus preventing rumors from spreading.  According to the law, the police and procuratorate are responsible for not only enforcing the law, but also enhancing sense of rule of law among the public. They have honored both duties in this case.  We hope the judiciary will be equally strict in following the law when dealing with other cases that do not have such strong attention from society.         "
Washington's rule-breaking will leave it out in the cold: China Daily editorial,9/2/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump. [Photo/IC]   Intent on showing his critics he is making America ""great again"", US President Donald Trump appears willing to lash out at pretty much everyone and everything these days.  But in seeking to find a doorstep on which to lay his troubles, he is not only losing friends and making enemies, he is also disrupting the global economic and trade order, and damaging the credibility of the United States.  While threatening to leave Canada out of NAFTA, and brushing aside the European Union's offer of zero car tariffs, the bellicose Trump refreshed his threat on Thursday to ""withdraw from the WTO"".  Negotiations with Canada failed because Trump wanted to make no concession. He declined the EU offer saying that EU consumers are accustomed to buying European cars. He dislikes the WTO because the US he claims has ""rarely won a lawsuit"" there.  It looks like he will not be satisfied unless Canada one-sidedly concedes, Europe finds a way to make more of its consumers love American cars, and the WTO twists its rules to please the White House.  Washington has problems with almost all major countries, and the evidence points to it being the Trump administration's policies rather than the US' trade partners that are to blame. Ford is one of the top five best-selling car brands in Europe, and the US has won more than 90 percent of the cases it has filed as the complainant.  Rather than ""making America great again"", what Trump is doing is dragging the US image through the mud.  Trump has a wrong concept about what is ""great"". He believes that to be ""great"" the US must lord it over others. No trade rules will satisfy the Trump administration unless they are bent in favor of the US.  But it is rules that enable countries to trade with one another knowing they will both benefit from the process. Fair trade can only be guaranteed if all parties observe the same rules.  The WTO's dispute resolution system is the most effective mechanism for settling trade disputes. And the US has taken advantage of it more than any other country.  In his all-round assault on multilateral international mechanisms, the US president is displaying the typical populist disdain for constraints, as populists by their nature consider theirs to be the only legitimate views and only valid demands.  But perhaps another reason why the US administration is showing such animosity toward the WTO is because it wants to divert attention from the fact that its trade complaints don't have a leg to stand on.

The police said the case against Yu has been withdrawn.      A screen shot from a video showing the knife attack in Kunshan, Jiangsu province. [Photo/IC]   Within two hours, the police post got over 200,000 ""likes"". On the WeChat public account, another social media platform, it won over 100,000 ""likes"" and was read millions of times. All these suggested the police move won public approval by upholding justice in this case.  During the past week, the case in Kunshan attracted nationwide attention, with the majority of voices online claiming Yu should be considered innocent. That's also partly why the decision of the local police and procuratorate won such wide support.  However, it is wrong to treat this case as merely a ""victory of public opinions"". The local police and procuratorate have explained, in detail, how they probed the entire process of the case: How did the whole case begin? How many times did Liu stab Yu and how many times did Yu stab back? Which cut caused Liu's death? All these questions have clear and unambiguous answers.  In each of their steps, the local police and procuratorate strictly followed the law. They never bent any legal clause to please public opinion.  Actually, the more attention they get from society, the more cautious the police and procuratorate will be. It is illusive to believe public opinions can bend the law in an age when everybody has a camera and a microphone.  Thus it is more proper to call the Kunshan case ""A shared victory of public opinions and the rule of law"". The judiciary has interacted positively with the public, while the rule of law has been strictly followed.  We also hope the judiciary will be equally strict when dealing with other cases that do not have such strong attention from society. Every case deserves serious treatment and justice.         "
"China Daily editorial: With its ploy exposed,  will the NYT eat crow?",8/31/2018,"                                                 [Photo/VCG]   And we thought only dubious or biased media outlets were in the business of spreading falsity. One day the US president tweets from another universe, and hours later admonishes people saying stories based on anonymous sources are ""fiction"". A couple of days before that, The New York Times publishes a report which is neither backed by facts nor crosschecked for authenticity.  The NYT quoted anonymous US federal health officials and scientists to say China has not been sharing samples of a deadly flu strain with the United States for more than a year, leaving health officials worried that trade tensions between the two countries could halt once-routine information sharing of medical and related issues.  Did the NYT crosscheck with the World Health Organization whether the US health officials' claim was true? No. Did it get a response from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention or the Chinese embassy in Washington? No.  Yet it went ahead and published the report on Monday accusing China of not sharing H7N9 influenza samples with the US. This is no small allegation; it could allow the US to falsely blame China for any delay or difficulty in its preparedness for the next epidemic threat.  Worse, the report uses a cooked-up premise to criticize China for using a public health issue as a trade weapon against the US, in an effort to paint China as a selfish member of the international community.  This is an apt example of exactly what journalism should not be about.  Indeed, WHO has guidelines for member countries on sharing samples of dangerous viruses so they can use them for research to develop vaccines and other cures. Speaking to China Daily, WHO and Chinese CDC officials said that health authorities in China and the US have been ""continuously"" and ""actively"" exchanging information and materials including those on viruses.  ""Specifically on H7N9, since May 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received five H7N9 virus samples from the Chinese center"", a WHO official said. The Chinese CDC's response was the same.  For the uninitiated, the Chinese and US centers for disease control are two of the six centers participating in WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System set up 66 years ago. China, driven by its policy, has been playing a key role in the global fight against epidemics and deadly diseases. Apart from collaborating with other countries, including the US, through WHO channels on SARS and different strains of bird flu, China has been praised by the international community for its role in the fight against the outbreaks of the Ebola virus in Africa and Zika virus in South America. These are the facts.  Making outlandish claims against China therefore will not only complicate the trade dispute further but also impede research into viruses.         "
Court will determine whether driver's death was in self-defense,8/30/2018,"                                                 The ebike rider is to stand trial for the motorist's death. [Photo/IC]   A car driver in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, who after hitting an electric bike at some traffic lights attacked the rider with a long knife was himself killed when, having dropped the knife, he was attacked by the ebike rider who picked up the knife. Yanzhao Metropolis Daily comments on Thursday.  Photos and videos of the incident have been widely posted and shared online, and information about the persons involved, including the past criminal record of the car driver, have also been spread online.  It seems that most people are on the side of the ebike rider, who has been detained, and they have little sympathy for the car driver who died. That's because the car driver hit the ebike in the first place, and instigated an argument before threatening the rider with a knife.  Besides, more information shows that the driver had been sentenced to prison before. He had served at least five prison terms, with an accumulated period of 9.5 years, having previously been convicted of several violent crimes.  The ebike rider is to stand trial for the motorist's death.  But, whatever the public thinks, the court must not let it influence the verdict. The court must base its judgment solely on the evidence and reach a verdict according to the law.  However, the local authorities should heed public opinion, which reveals that people feel insecure because they suspect the driver had links to criminal gangs and no one knows who will be next if they meet drivers like the one in the case.  In order to make people feel safe, the local police should echo the call of the top leadership and strike organized crime gangs if the case leads to any. Only when people feel secure will the criminal cases diminish.         "
Military exercise should not be misinterpreted: China Daily editorial,8/30/2018,"                                                 Chinese officers and soldiers waves to say goodbye to Russian fleet during a China-Russia naval joint drill at sea off south China's Guangdong province, Sept 19, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]   Despite some wild speculation, China's upcoming joint military exercise with Russia and Mongolia is nothing untoward.  It has become a routine practice for China and Russia to hold smaller scale military exercises, and the two neighbors have also regularly participated in and led multilateral drills under the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in recent years.  The planned drills scheduled for Sept 11-15 are simply on a larger scale than usual. Codenamed Vostok-2018, or East-2018, the exercise will reportedly involve almost 300,000 troops and more than 1,000 military aircraft, with China sending about 3,200 troops, more than 900 pieces of military hardware and a combined total of 30 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.  Thanks to efforts from both sides, Beijing and Moscow have made much headway in forging a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, and military-to-military exchanges have played their part in strengthening mutual trust. In fact, bilateral ties are in excellent shape at present, meaning it is only natural that the two neighbors should choose to strengthen their military-to-military ties, as these are a barometer of the bilateral relationship.  China and Russia are two important forces in maintaining peace and stability in the region and beyond. Closer and smoother coordination between their military forces will put them in a better position to respond to potential threats and even a crisis in the region, which is unsettled because of territorial disputes and the tensions relating to the Korean Peninsula.  On China's part, as it is increasingly an active contributor to international peacekeeping efforts, joint military exercises also help improve its military personnel's combat capabilities and cooperative skills with counterparts in foreign military forces.  The suspicions and concerns surrounding the upcoming Russia-China-Mongolia military exercise stem from the Cold War mentality in the West and display a double standard: The frequent war games conducted by the United States and its allies around the world are well received and even lauded as a show of solidarity, while those that China and non-Western countries participate in are viewed with suspicion.  One element to the exercise that has been remarked upon is the inclusion of simulated nuclear weapons attacks, with the rationale for this being flipped, to make it seem a threat rather than a response to such an attack.  History shows misjudgment of other countries' strategies can be both dangerous and costly, so the West should not view such exercises through a distorted prism.         "
No credibility to Trump's China-hacking tweets: China Daily editorial,8/30/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump. [Photo/IC]   ""Report just out: 'China hacked Hillary Clinton's private Email Server.' ... Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!"" tweeted United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday morning.  Obviously, that was not enough for an excited Trump, so he tweeted again, three hours later, ""Hillary Clinton's Emails, many of which are Classified Information, got hacked by China,"" adding that the credibility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice will be forever gone"" if they fail to act on it.  To the thinking person, there are few things more disconcerting than a tweet by the US president as they initially seem to accord to reality but then quickly turn into messages from some alternative universe.  But of course, there is method behind his Twittering. Although the Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied the allegation, that will not deter the US president from smearing China's image as he desperately needs a scapegoat in the run-up to the midterm elections, so he can divert public attention from the troubles the White House has become mired in.  And China, against whom he is launching a trade war, is an easy candidate for that role, since it has long been demonized by US politicians. Now we have heard his proponents warning about possible Chinese meddling in the US midterm elections, and the US president himself blaming China for his failure to maneuver progress in relations with Pyongyang.  Although, to be fair, it is not just China that Trump is maligning. The FBI and DOJ have also had their integrity impugned.  An FBI official, quoting a June report by the DOJ inspector general, told the media following the US president's Twitter messages, that ""the FBI investigation and its forensic analysis did not find evidence that Clinton's email server systems were compromised"".  Trump, as president, is fully aware of such conclusions.  It is ironic that just hours after spreading the allegation, the US president admonished people on Twitter that stories based on anonymous sources are ""fiction"" — the story alleging a Chinese-owned company hacked Hillary Clinton's private server was published by a right-wing newspaper based on anonymous sources ""briefed on the matter"".  Based on both his own definition and from the perspective of the FBI investigation, what he has just resorted to is fiction. Since his supporters have shown a willingness to suspend disbelief, we can no doubt look forward to more such tales.         "
China steps up to the plate in global fight against drugs: China Daily editorial,8/29/2018,"                                                 [Photo/VCG]   In a move to counter the sharp increases in the abuse and production of synthetic drugs, the Chinese government has added another 32 new psychoactive substances including 4-chlorophenyl to a national control list, bringing the total number of such substances under strict government control to 170, the Office of the National Narcotics Control Committee said on Wednesday.  This reflects China's resolve to play its due part in the global fight against illegal drugs, as the expanded list now covers not only psychoactive substances that are under control internationally and widely abused in China, but also those that are produced in China but abused in other countries such as the United States.  The rapidly emerging psychoactive substances, which are produced in labs with chemicals, can be many times more potent than traditional illegal drugs such as heroin. Yet due to loopholes in the existing anti-drug laws, they can often be readily available for purchase because they are still to be classified as illegal drugs. Even when banned, manufacturers can change the formulas to keep them a step ahead of laws that ban the products based on their chemical composition.  Although China has made great progress in its anti-drug campaign in recent years - it has seized 459 tons of drugs and arrested 1 million suspects in 860,000 drug-related cases over the past five years - it still lacks experience in dealing with the new class of drugs because of their huge diversity. The development of new psychoactive drugs is so fast that authorities have to struggle to keep up their list of controlled substances.  Thus, it is imperative for countries to coordinate their anti-drug efforts so that they can share their clues on cross-border cases or identify and track the emergence of novel drugs more effectively. Information sharing between Chinese and US narcotics law enforcement officials since last year has led to the cracking of the first case involving fentanyl class substances between the two countries, with 21 suspects arrested. Such substances are not widely abused in China but are quite popular in the US.  The expansion of the international synthetic drugs market including that for new psychoactive substances is a new phenomenon yet it poses a huge health risk to people around the world, given there is still limited awareness about their dangers. The latest move by China will serve as a shot in the arm for the international fight against drugs.         "
US kicks itself in teeth with trade aggression: China Daily editorial,8/29/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump. [Photo/VCG]   Although the longer-term trade balances of the United States remain unknown, the July data at least should caution the Donald Trump administration that its hawkish trade policy may be backfiring.  President Trump has always argued that the colossal trade deficits come from other countries' ""unfair"" trade practices. But this conveniently excuses the fact that the US' domestic savings rate has been consistently low in the past decades. Which, as many mainstream economists have pointed out, means that Americans spend too much and demand imports to support their consumption habits.  The president has also ignored the evolving trend of the international division of labor, which has led to a large number of US multinationals transferring their production to other countries, especially East Asian economies. Rather than China exporting its oversupply and low wages as the administration claims, it is ""exports"" of these companies to the US that account for much of the overall trade deficit.  By imposing hefty tariffs on imports from China and other trade partners, the US has failed to tackle the fundamental weaknesses in its economy. Thus, the tariffs will not effectively help it attain its professed policy goal of reducing the country's trade deficits. Instead, they will only hinder the healthy growth of the US economy.  The administration's protectionist stance has triggered legitimate retaliation from the US' trade partners, leading to declining exports of agricultural products to those countries, which is believed to be behind the significant widening of its trade deficits in July.  If the Trump administration sticks to its unilateral intimidation-based trade policies, the situation will only get worse, affecting exports of more US products and possibly leading to widening trade deficits in the coming months.  Economists have warned that the protectionist trade policies of the US and the ensuing trade retaliation by affected countries risk disrupting the global trade order and dragging on the still fragile global economy. If the further tariffs the administration has proposed become a reality, they will, coupled with the strengthening dollar, further dampen US exports and exacerbate its trade deficits.  The US started to accumulate a goods trade deficit in the 1970s but failed to tackle the root cause: its low savings rate. Instead, it sought to pressure its economic competitors, such as Japan in the 1980s, to try to reduce its deficits.  Now it is using the same strategy against China. And it is predictable that it will not work.         "
"DPRK detente will not last if US insists on all take, no give: China Daily editorial",8/28/2018,"                                                 Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, arrives at Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang. [Photo/Agencies]   Frustrated there has been no tangible progress on denuclearization, the Donald Trump administration has just reached a fresh consensus with Japan and the Republic of Korea on sustaining the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, until the latter gives up nuclear weapons.  Even amid the ostensible detente following the June 12 Singapore meeting between Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, there was no mention of discontinuing what Trump described as a ""maximum pressure"" tactic. But what US State Secretary Mike Pompeo reiterated in his latest phone conversations with his Japanese and ROK counterparts is a clear indication of the White House's belated recognition that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula is not as simple as it once believed.  Trump entered into personal engagement with his counterpart in Pyongyang assuming his predecessors were all inferior; he, on the other hand, had a magic wand. It is good that the US president has finally come to terms with the reality, and he has conceded that the matter is complicated, something that will be more conducive to him making informed decisions about how the denuclearization process is to be approached.  By now Trump should be aware denuclearization will not happen overnight, at least not the way he anticipated. His predecessors were not as ""foolish"" as he portrayed them to be. Indeed, the likelihood is high that he may find himself returning to the same path they followed and end up in a similar position.  Because after all, like all his predecessors found out, nuclear weapons are the sole and ultimate bargaining chip Pyongyang has, meaning it will not forsake them without getting what it wants. In return for abandoning its nuclear arsenal, Pyongyang seeks a cast iron security guarantee, economic assistance and probably a lot more. And with that in mind, Pyongyang naturally expects the process to be one of give-and-take.  After nullifying a nuclear test ground, some missile launchers and returning the remains of wartime US service people, Pyongyang is now awaiting something concrete in return.  It should come as no surprise, therefore, if Pyongyang condemns the latest US-Japan-ROK agreement as proof of the insincerity in which the US is conducting the denuclearization negotiations.

Japan's defense paper at odds with reality: China Daily editorial,8/28/2018,"                                             As has become the norm, Japan's latest defense white paper points an accusing finger at surrounding countries, including China, for creating security concerns. The document, which was approved by Japan's Cabinet on Tuesday, justifies Japan's expansion and strengthening of its Self-Defense Forces by citing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China and Russia as security threats. However, this merely shows that despite its tentative steps toward an independent foreign policy, it is still reluctant to emerge from under the protective arm of the United States. As the Shinzo Abe administration knows, it is the provocative moves by the Donald Trump administration that have been setting the region on edge. And rather than it being China's assertive actions that threaten the status quo, as the document claims — alluding to China's island building activities in the South China Sea — it is Japan that has done that by nationalizing some of the Diaoyu Islands that China claims sovereignty of in the East China Sea. To maintain the dominance of the US Asia-Pacific alliance system and thus Japan's place in the regional order, the Abe administration has sought to strengthen Japan-US cooperation since it came into office. And it has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to dance to Washington's tune. However, since it took office, the Trump administration has continually reinforced the fact that the alliance system is for the US' own ends. It has repeatedly rebuffed Abe's attempts to forge a special relationship and make Japan an exception to Trump's ""America first"" trade policies. As a result, Tokyo has recently been seeking a rapprochement with Beijing, realizing that they can be good neighbors and that as a staunch supporter of free trade and advocate of fairer global governance, China is promoting regional development from which Japan too will benefit. However, with Japan's latest defense white paper still finding fault with China's defense budget, military modernization and the normal operation of its sea and air forces, it has cast doubt over Tokyo's sincerity in seeking to improve ties with Beijing. Wisdom in action comes from knowing the true cause of one's troubles. Instead of casting aspersions on others, Tokyo should reflect on its own policies as it is these that are the fundamental cause of its angst. Instead of trying to make its neighbors wear caps that don't fit, Tokyo should reflect on its own military ambitions and foreign policies which are major factors disturbing regional peace and stability. The Abe administration should take the initiative and do more to deepen trust with China and other countries in the region, instead of continually looking across the Pacific for a lead.         "
World has enough troubles without a new Cold War: China Daily editorial,8/27/2018,"                              US president Donald Trump. File photo. [Photo/VCG]       In a sign that the Donald Trump administration is hellbent on reviving the Cold War, the US Navy held a ceremony at Norfolk in Virginia on Friday for the re-establishment of its US Second Fleet which will be responsible for naval forces along the East Coast and in the northern Atlantic Ocean.The fleet was created in the 1950s primarily to counter the former Soviet Union’s military activities on the Atlantic Rim, before it was disbanded in 2011 as part of the Pentagon’s cost-saving plan. The decision to resurrect the outdated structures of the Cold War will only exacerbate tensions with Russia.The move cannot but make people wonder why the United States is so intent on reviving the great power rivalry that kept the world on the brink of nuclear Armageddon for so long. Does Russia really pose a bigger threat to US citizens than terrorist groups such as al-Qaida? The US National Defense Strategy labels Russia and China as “revisionist powers” that pose “growing threats” to the US. Yet it is the opposite that is true. To deal with the imagined threats from Beijing and Moscow, the Trump administration has been adopting an increasingly aggressive defense strategy, with the US president recently announcing a plan to build a “space force” to ensure US dominance in that domain. He has also said he wants a 10-fold increase in the US nuclear arsenal.The hawkish makeup of the Trump administration and the personality of the US president, who has an unhealthy fascination with the military, combined with his casual remarks about using nuclear weapons, make the prospect of a return to the high-stakes brinkmanship and proxy wars of the Cold War increasingly likely.Is it profits, status or simply petrified beliefs that motivate the US administration to keep generating an atmosphere of war? If it is in pursuit of an arms race that it hopes will bring its ”rivals” to their knees under the unbearable weight of defense budgets, then it should bear in mind the cost to itself. Many in the US already worry its military spending is putting the nation on a path to fiscal ruin. The Cold War, which also bred many hot wars, should be consigned to the history books where it belongs. Instead of looking fearfully backward to the past, Washington should look boldly forward to the future and seek to build a new type of relations with Russia and China.         "
Bright prospects lie ahead for Belt and Road Initiative: China Daily editorial,8/27/2018,"                          Sculptures stand out against the harsh desert background at an outdoor exhibition in Wuwei, Gansu province, on Aug 22, 2018. The project invited artists from home and abroad to create original artworks based on desert-related themes. [Photo/XINHUA]   Embracing the principles of inclusiveness and openness, the Belt and Road Initiative is in striking contrast to the unilateralism and trade protectionism adopted by some countries. Proposed five years ago by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the initiative epitomizes China’s understanding of what a globalized world should be and its vision of shared development. In contrast to the “America first” policies proposed by the Trump administration of the United States, what the Road and Belt Initiative stresses is that all countries can cooperate in a fair and reasonable manner and by doing so, all can benefit. That is exactly what the Belt and Road Initiative seeks to achieve by helping the countries involved with their infrastructure construction programs, as greater connectivity promises to inject vigor into economies and regions. And with an increasing number of economies getting involved, it will create more engines for the development of the global economy and create conditions for the reform of global governance to make it fairer and more all-embracing. There are voices that speak ill of the initiative, labeling it as new colonialism or a means to extend China’s influence. However, what the initiative has achieved in the past five years and how it has been welcomed by an increasing number of countries speaks volumes for China’s sincerity and earnestness in making down-to-earth efforts to bring in as well as go out and realize cooperation for mutual benefits.By July this year, China had already signed agreements with more than 100 countries for Belt and Road cooperation projects, involving countries in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and the South Pacific.And China’s trade volume with the Belt and Road countries grew by 11.3 percent from January to July this year, 2.7 percentage points higher than the average of the country’s overall foreign trade. In 2017 alone, China’s investment in these countries was $14.3 billion, accounting for 12 percent of the country’s overseas investment in the same period. The initiative now encompasses infrastructure, finance, culture, people-to-people relations, and even relations between states. It demonstrates that China is shouldering more responsibilities as its capabilities increase.Speaking at a symposium in Beijing on Monday to mark the fifth anniversary of the initiative, Xi said that the Belt and Road cooperation will benefit the people of the countries concerned and help build a community with a shared future for humanity.As long as China and the countries involved join hands, the initiative will have a bright future.

EU’s aid to Iran shows US alone in opposing deal: China Daily editorial,8/26/2018,"                          FILE PHOTO: Euro coins are seen in front of displayed flag and map of European Union in this picture illustration taken in Zenica, May 28 2015.[Photo/Agencies]   The European Union’s decision to give Iran more than 18 million euros ($20.6 million) in development aid to counter the effects of US sanctions is a courageous as well as welcome move.  It is also a sign of how the US hard-line policy toward Iran and its unilateral scrapping of the multilateral Iranian nuclear deal are perceived as perverse mistakes by the rest of the international community.  The aid package, which was revealed on Thursday, focuses on sustainable economic and social development, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises, environmental projects and those countering the harm of drugs. It is the EU’s latest attempt to uphold the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal.  Obviously, the EU move has come at a critical moment as the United States has just revived its first round of sanctions against Iran. As one of the signatories to the deal, the EU has adamantly opposed the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the US from the deal and efforts to tear it apart. China, which is also a signatory to the deal, has also denounced the US decision and opposes Washington's unilateral sanctions.  Thursday’s move is clear evidence that the EU has no intention of backing away from the deal on Iran and its divide with the US on the issue is only getting wider. This may be bad news for Washington but contributes to international efforts to bolster the Iranian nuclear deal.  US President Donald Trump’s self-serving action against Iran has worsened the security outlook of the Middle East and disrupted normal business interactions between Iran and other countries.  The Trump administration has no right to force others to dance to its tune. Countries have a legitimate right to conduct normal economic relations with Iran.  Teheran's legal challenge against the renewed sanctions by the US goes before the UN's top court on Monday. It argues that the US has no right to reinstate the sanctions and it is calling on the International Court of Justice to ""immediately suspend"" them. The ICJ is expected to take a couple of months to announce a provisional ruling.  In the meantime, what the EU is doing in opposing the US’ Iran policy should reinforce the international community’s confidence in the legitimacy and righteousness of the Iran nuclear deal.         "
Groundless to accuse Beijing of stalling Korean progress: China Daily editorial,8/26/2018,"                          FILE PHOTO: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, US, July 18, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   United States President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that his secretary of state is postponing a planned visit to Pyongyang until the “trading relationship with China is resolved”. Considering the lack of progress in China-US trade talks, that could be quite a while.  It is one thing to say a trade war with China is distracting, it is another thing to blame Beijing for the less than fruitful progress in negotiations between the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  Beijing has retorted angrily to Trump making such an accusation, stating it is continuing to help with the process of denuclearization as it was. Denouncing it as irresponsible, the Chinese foreign ministry said it was “seriously concerned” by Trump's ""capricious"" accusations and said it has lodged an official diplomatic complaint over the comments.  Indeed, Trump's tweet goes against the basic truth that it would be to Beijing’s own detriment should it slacken its efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is not only conducive to the DPRK’s own aspirations for prosperity, but would offer China long-term security dividends. For its own benefit, Beijing’s commitment to denuclearization is not just rhetorical.  That being said, Beijing is correct on insisting that Korean Peninsula issues are mostly the contradictions between the US and the DPRK, which will not be resolved without Washington and Pyongyang straightening out their longstanding differences.  Beijing can hardly help with Washington and Pyongyang being unable to even agree on where to start when it comes to denuclearization.  Trump based his belief that Beijing is not helping with the process of denuclearization as it was because ""of our much tougher trading stance with China"".  And the present state of China-US trade interactions does warrant concerns over both parties’ capabilities to manage their dispute, so as to prevent it from jeopardizing the overall relationship.  Beijing, for its part, is trying hard to contain any spillover, but clearly Trump, facing growing difficulties at home with the midterm elections looming, is looking to unfairly portray China as the cause of all the problems that are of his administration's own making.  Instead of trying to lay the blame for the lack of progress in denuclearization at Beijing's door, the Trump administration should show greater sincerity and flexibility and prove it is acting in good faith by responding to Pyongyang's displays of earnestness with concrete actions of its own.

US will aggravate self-inflicted wounds by persisting with tariffs: China Daily editorial,8/23/2018,"                                             The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday, forcing China to retaliate and impose tariffs on US goods of equal value. The US move, although expected, does not bode well for the ongoing talks in Washington, in which the US delegation is supposedly seeking to find common ground with China. Although US policymakers surely know that it is dialogue, not tariff-based pressure, that is only way to escape a destructive full-on trade war, the Donald Trump administration continues to promise further tariffs, perhaps believing it can bend Beijing to its will. If so, it is a misperception that precludes a negotiated agreement. Likewise, if the tariff attacks are intended to ultimately block all Chinese imports to the US and discourage US companies from outsourcing operations to Chinese territory - as part of a strategy in the bigger geostrategic rivalry the Trump administration envisions - then the talks are not going to produce any substantial outcome. Whatever the intended ultimate aim, if the Trump administration continues to insist on sticking to its ideological guns, it is not going to be just China that feels the pain, US industries and consumers will increasingly become collateral damage as the caliber of the two countries' tariff exchanges increases. In the hearings this week organized by the US Trade Representative's Office, many US enterprises have already expressed their strong opposition to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. Economists have also warned that the tariffs will force consumers in the US to dig deeper and deeper into their pockets. The US administration's tariffs have also put a big dent in the country's exports. Its agricultural and livestock exports to China, for example, slumped in June, down by 34.4 percent and 39.2 percent respectively year-on-year, according to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. And according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, net inward investment in the US by multinational corporations - both foreign and American - has fallen sharply. In his inaugural address in January last year, Trump said his mission was to protect the US from ""the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs"" and declared, ""protection will lead to great prosperity and strength"". The increasingly severe self-inflicted wounds are evidence to the contrary and are testimony to the reality that China-US trade has benefited both countries. If the two sides sort out some of the issues that have emerged, there is no reason why they cannot both continue to benefit from the trade.         "
Canberra's bias still hurdle to better ties: China Daily editorial,8/23/2018,"                                                 The logo of the Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is seen outside its headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, April 17, 2012. [Photo/Agencies]   The Australian government's decision to ban Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE from its 5G network is disappointing as well as poisonous to bilateral cooperation. The ill-advised move again casts a shadow over bilateral ties, which had been showing some signs of improvement recently.  According to a federal government statement issued on Thursday, security concerns and the companies' Chinese backgrounds were the main reasons behind the ban, as it claimed companies that ""are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" would leave the nation's network vulnerable to unauthorized access or interference.  Back in 2012, Australia used similar reasons to block Huawei from bidding for its national broadband project.  As before, Australia's harsh treatment of Huawei and ZTE stems from bias and discrimination against the Chinese companies, with the alleged security risks just a convenient pretext that Australia has borrowed from the United States.  Both Huawei and ZTE have consistently denied they have any links to the Chinese government and both providers are accepted in many countries, including countries in Europe. They are no strangers to the Australian telecom market either. Take Huawei as an example, it already has a 55 percent share of Australia's 4G market.  The ban is an all-lose scenario that goes against the spirit of fairness in international trade cooperation. Thus it is only natural that China has expressed grave concerns about the decision and urged the Australian government to abandon its ideological prejudices and provide a fair competitive environment for Chinese companies' operations in Australia,  Trade and business cooperation is in the interests of both countries, and Australia should be facilitating reciprocal interaction, not putting obstacles in the way.  Given the anti-China sentiment that had been allowed to fester in Australia seemed to have reached a peak, as there were several signals from the Australian government — including from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull — that it wanted to mend relations, the decision shows Canberra still lacks sincerity in matching words with deeds.  With Turnbull's future as prime minister yet to be decided, it remains to be seen how Australia's stance toward its largest trade partner will evolve, and whether it will be for the better or worse.  While their current frictions could no doubt be aggravated, it would be better if the two sides devoted themselves to advancing their comprehensive strategic partnership. Doing so would bring tangible benefits not only to them but also the region as whole.         "
US plan deals blow to fight against global warming: China Daily editorial,8/22/2018,"                                                 An abandoned home stands near the Longview Power Plant, a coal-fired plant, stands on Aug 21, 2018 in Maidsville, West Virginia.   There have been record high temperatures throughout many parts of the world this summer and the oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up for the first time on record. However, instead of spurring it to make greater efforts to fight climate change, the government of the United States is dismantling President Barack Obama's 2015 Clean Power Plan so it can revive the US coal industry.  Furthermore, the Trump administration has also proposed easing gas-mileage requirements for vehicles, a move that may actually increase the country's climate-changing emissions, according to some former top Environmental Protection Agency officials, environmental groups and other opponents of the move.  It should be clear to everyone that the current US government does not care about climate change, as shown by US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement at the very beginning of his presidency.  There is no denying burning more coal will generate more carbon emissions, which have been recognized as being responsible for stoking the accelerated warming of the Earth's climate. The whole world has been doing what it can to reduce the use of fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy such as solar, wind and thermal power.  The US, as the world's largest economy and the sole superpower, has always been expected to not just set an example in this regard, but also lead the world in its attempt to slow the pace of global warming.  Former US president Barack Obama's 2015 Clean Power Plan is designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. China has also its own plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 65 percent from its 2005 level.  With such efforts by the world's major countries, there were hopes that the pace of global warming would be reduced.  Yet by withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement, deregulating coal production and easing of gas mileage requirements for vehicles, the US administration has put its own interests and those of its fossil fuel backers above the common good.  The fight against climate change is one we must win for future generations and Chinese officials have reiterated time again on different occasions that the country will continue with its efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.  China hopes that the rest of the world will maintain their consensus on this issue and press ahead with the fight against global warming.         "
Military trust key to better Sino-Indian ties: China Daily editorial,8/22/2018,"                                             Defense Minister Wei Fenghe's ongoing four-day visit to India, which started on Tuesday, marks another major step forward in efforts by the two countries to rebuild trust between the two militaries, one year after a 73-day military standoff in Donglang. The standoff, which came to an end only after the two armies agreed to disengage following diplomatic intervention, plunged bilateral relations to a low unseen for many years. Yet the fact that it ended peacefully thanks to both sides upholding established rules of conduct along their disputed border reflects the resilience in their relations. It also underscores the importance of the two militaries maintaining strategic communication to avoid any misjudgment that could threaten peace and tranquility along their 3,500-kilometer border, which is yet to be delimited. That is what Wei is expected to achieve with his visit, the first by a Chinese defense minister in six years, as the two sides are reportedly trying to deliberate on a mechanism under which troops from both sides will inform each other before carrying out any activities in disputed areas. There are also reports that both sides will explore the possibility of setting up a hotline between the two armies. This positive momentum was initiated by the informal summit between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan, Hubei province, in April, during which the two leaders agreed to set the Donglang standoff aside and turn a new chapter in China-India relations. There is no reason for the two neighbors to get bogged down in their border dispute that is a legacy of history, as the common interests they share far outweigh their differences. The fact that not a single bullet has been fired at the border over the past nearly five decades reflects the utmost importance both countries have attached to peace. With a combined population of 2.6 billion, or 40 percent of the world's total, the two largest developing countries can work together on many issues, such as global trade and climate change, poverty alleviation and counterterrorism, on which they see eye to eye. That's why Modi termed bilateral relations ""a factor of stability in the world"", during his meeting with Wei on Tuesday. Of course, there are differences between the two neighbors, but so long as they take each other's concerns and interests into full account and seek to resolve their differences through talks and consultation, Sino-Indian relations will continue to prosper.

No breathing space for Taiwan's 'independence': China Daily editorial,8/21/2018,"                          Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen attends a news conference in Taipei April 11, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Just hours after Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen landed on the island on her return from a trip to two Latin American countries, another, El Salvador, cut its ""diplomatic relations"" with Taipei, switching them to Beijing.  The timing is too sensitive to be acceptable, according to the enraged authorities in Taipei.  Indeed, it is both ironic and embarrassing for a diplomatic mission intended to cement, if not expand, international recognition to end up shrinking it. Let alone Tsai and her colleagues have lobbied hard ""through all channels"" available to keep the Central American country on the shortening list of countries that have ""diplomatic relations"" with the island.  However ""unacceptable"" it is, it is an indication of the increasingly explicit, and inescapable, reality facing Tsai. The more she tries to enlarge international recognition for Taiwan as an independent entity, the smaller the space for her pursuit becomes.  Of course, what in others' eyes was a slap in the face may not make Tsai rethink her approach and consider changing course. Shortly prior to losing El Salvador's ""diplomatic recognition"", upon arrival at Taiwan's international airport, she said ""pressure"" ""would only boost our determination to go abroad"".  But Tsai is significantly overestimating her capability for sustaining a confrontational approach to cross-Straits ties. Since assuming office on May 20, 2016, she has lost the ""diplomatic recognition"" of five countries. El Salvador is the third this year. Although Taiwan still has ""diplomatic relations"" with 17 countries, nobody knows whether there will be a next, who it will be, and when. But what is likely is Tsai's losing streak will continue if she continues with her anti-mainland stunts.  Cross-Straits relations do not have to be like this, though. The ""pressure"" Tsai and her like-minded colleagues feel is not aimed at Taiwan, or even her Democratic Progressive Party itself, but at their stubborn pursuit of ""Taiwan independence"".  Beijing demonstrated its sincere desire to sustain the cross-Straits rapport established under the Kuomintang authorities prior to Tsai assuming office, stating it was willing to work with anyone who recognizes there is only one China.  Under Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, Taiwan did not have to worry about ""pressure"" from the mainland, nor did it lose any ""diplomatic ally"". Instead, upholding the ""one China"" consensus brought various benefits to people on both sides of the Straits.  Tsai's obsession with de facto independence is the obstacle to Taiwan's pursuit of ""international breathing space"".         "
Paranoia in White House bedevils bilateral relations: China Daily editorial,8/20/2018,"                                                 A file photo of US President Donald Trump. [Photo/Agencies]   On Saturday, United States President Donald Trump called on ""all of the fools"" focusing on Russia to ""start also looking in another direction, China"".  On Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton told ABC's This Week that he could say ""definitively"" there is a ""national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling, and North Korean meddling"" in the 2018 midterm elections.  This can't be coincidence. Quite likely it is a clumsy attempt by the White House to distract public attention from Robert Mueller's unyielding probe into ties between Trump's campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 US general elections.   It should go without saying that the claims of Chinese meddling are ridiculous; they had never been heard before Sunday. It will certainly be mission impossible to substantiate the latest allegations as judging from what Bolton said - and did not say - he was not talking about anything taking place in the real world, but something the paranoid White House has imagined.   If Bolton's allegation was meant to lend support to Trump's, it didn't. Because the logic here is inherently problematic: while Trump was trying to discredit an investigation into something that is supposed to have occurred, Bolton pointed his finger at something he, or perhaps the entire White House, worries may, or may not, happen.   But the Trump-Bolton double act over the weekend should not be dismissed as a comedy duo saying little of significance. For at the very least it offers fresh evidence that the unfolding trade war is only one aspect of the troubled China-US relationship.   The klutzy attempt at misdirection exploits the growing ""red-under-the bed"" anti-China sentiment that is being whipped up in the US by an increasingly bullish and beleaguered administration. The White House is trying to use China as a political foil to serve its political agenda.  With the US intent on portraying everything China does in a negative light, there is no point in trying to appease it.   The abuse and menace toward China now emanating from the White House, should prompt Beijing to reconsider its approach. With Beijing increasingly being viewed as a strategic adversary, the latter must recalibrate its long-standing US policies, which have placed overwhelming weight on engagement by expanding common ground.   Meanwhile, the White House should be cautious that its bullyragging does not lead it by the nose.

That may explain why he toured the campus of online shopping giant Alibaba Group in Hangzhou and watched an outdoor performance of state-of-the-art drones produced by DJI prior to his meetings with top Chinese leaders in Beijing during his five-day visit to China that ends on Tuesday.  Mahathir has said that adopting technology from countries such as China is crucial to achieving the economic reform he has promised to deliver. ""We'd like to tap your idea of modern technology for the benefit of the people (in Malaysia),"" he told Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma on Saturday after a briefing on its latest ventures.  Given that he appears to be open to further Chinese investment and Malaysia stands to gain from increased exposure to Chinese trade, technology and entrepreneurship, there is no reason to think the two countries' long-standing friendly relations are being tested by his balking at the cost of the projects that were authorized by his predecessor. Counting the dollars is an understandable concern with Malaysia's national debt and liabilities now standing at $250 billion. A Malaysian panel of experts reviewing the economy and public finances is due to present its recommendations to Mahathir on his return.  The memorandums of understanding signed during Mahathir's visit certainly convey the message that the two countries' friendly relations remain unchanged, and it was a message that both Mahathir and President Xi Jinping emphasized during their meeting on Monday afternoon.  China's Belt and Road Initiative is being maligned by those who view China's vision of shared development with concern and suspicion, and it is with ill-will that they have greeted the tiff over suspension of the projects in Malaysia as a sign of a regional divide.  However, Mahathir's visit has once again shown the two countries share Asian values and can handle any disagreements with mutual respect.  And with Malaysia adhering to a policy of strategic independence, the two countries can set right the tone and direction for the region as a whole by keeping the big picture in mind, promoting free and fair trade, and encouraging other countries in the region to uphold Asian values.

Imperative efforts made to make UN more relevant: China Daily editorial,8/19/2018,"                          The Joint Special Envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan waits before a meeting at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva May 8, 2012. [Photo/Agencies]   He tried to prevent the Iraq war, but failed.  He tried to make multilateralism the norm in international dispute resolution, but to little avail.  He tried to reform the United Nations and give it relevance in the present-day world, but again with limited success.  Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan passed away with plenty of regrets. Yet, for his dedication to world peace, particularly what he contributed to UN peace-keeping in turbulent times, he has been lauded.  Although his stint as the UN's top diplomat had controversies, that no doubt had to do with the inherent constraints of the UN as an international political institution with limited authority over issues of critical significance. In that sense, Annan's helplessness was reminiscent of that of the UN's. Few people in that position could claim an impeccable record.  The UN, at the core of the post-war international political arrangement, is supposed to serve as the ultimate forum for the discourse and resolution of international affairs. But the consensus on which it was built decades back is seriously undermined today by divisions that have reached levels no individual politician can substantially influence or bridge.  The Donald Trump administration of the United States, with its ""America First"" policy, is dealing a heavy blow to the limited achievements the international community has made in institutionalizing multilateral mechanisms. While contradictions among UN Security Council members are seriously undermining the UN's capability for decision-making over key international concerns, rendering it ineffective when it is badly needed.  The outcomes are detrimental to the UN itself, raising questions about the effectiveness, if not relevance, of what should be an indispensable institution.  It is dangerous to allow the present state of affairs to persist, because that will inevitably lead to the marginalization of the UN.  The world is undergoing major developments, transformation and adjustment, but peace and security remain the call of the times, the UN must adapt so it can fulfill its intended role as a forum for multilateralism.  To prevent the UN from being sidelined, it is imperative to carry Annan's legacy forward, making the UN slimmer, and more efficient, and more heeding of its smaller members thus making it more relevant.

US has a wrong attitude when looking at China: China Daily editorial,8/19/2018,"                                                 Chinese Navy hospital ship Peace Ark arrives in the Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the United States, on June 29, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]   There is something wrong with the way that the United States looks at China and its development, particularly the advancements in its military capabilities.  Were it not for its insistence on persisting with its Cold War mentality, the United States would have no reason to be continually harping on about China's military strength, especially in terms of concern.  The Pentagon's annual report on military developments involving the People's Republic of China is the latest manifestation of this, claiming that China is pursuing a nuclear capability for its long-range bombers, and it asserts that the Chinese air force ""has been reassigned a nuclear mission"".  Reading between lines it is saying that China's long-range bombers will be capable of launching a nuclear attack against the United States.  So what? It is one thing to have the capability of doing something, it is another thing to have the intention of doing it.  It should go without saying that not only is China far from being strong enough to challenge the US, it also has no desire to do so.  As the world's sole superpower, the US has developed the habit of considering itself to be always standing on the moral high ground and it is used to doing whatever it wants, even if that means interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.  Rather than the US being concerned about China, it is China that should be concerned about the US, since it is constantly referring to China as a rival and a threat.  It brings to mind the Chinese saying that a magistrate is allowed to burn down houses, but ordinary residents have no right to light a lamp.  It is natural for China, the world's second-largest economy, to have a military that is able to protect its interests and strong enough to defend its sovereignty and territory integrity. The country's peaceful rise does not mean it should not be able to defend its interests, while having a military that can fulfill those duties does not mean it represents a threat to another country.  If we employ the US' logic that a strong military poses a threat to other countries, then it is the US, which has the world's strongest military, that is the biggest threat to the world.  For world peace and the building of an international community with a shared future, the US needs to change its mentality when it looks at China's development, the advancement of its military capabilities in particular.

Those pursuing domestic technology innovations must not cut corners: China Daily editorial,8/16/2018,"                          Photo/IC   It is shocking that the Redcore browser, which its “developers” boasted as being the first domestically produced browser with self-developed core technology, was exposed on Thursday as being one based on Google Chrome.  AllMobilize, the company behind the product, called the software China’s first web browser using fully self-developed intellectual property when it announced on Wednesday that in its latest funding round it had secured a further 250 million yuan ($36.3 million) from venture capital investors.  However, users looking through the browser’s installation directory had discovered a file named “chrome.exe” along with files containing the Chrome logo. After the revelations, the download installer for Redcore was removed from the company’s website.  One of the company’s chief developers has reportedly stated that the software is based on the framework of Google Chrome, but has insisted that the core browser technology was developed by the company as it incorporates their innovations.  There are two questions that need to be answered: Whether the browser does employ domestically developed core technology and, even if it does, have the intellectual property rights of Google been infringed upon.  China has been paying more attention to protecting the intellectual property rights of foreign companies and has strengthened the country’s laws and enforcement, increasing the price to be paid for violations. If the browser proves to be a total sham and AllMobilize is in violation of the US company’s intellectual property rights then it should be duly punished.  It is important that those caught infringing intellectual property rights pay a heavy price for their misdeeds to deter others from similar wrongdoing.  Heavily penalizing violators will also help ensure a proper environment for domestic research and development. A lot of researchers and entrepreneurs seem to forget that all innovations and scientific discoveries are based on relentless efforts and perseverance. Instead, they try and cut corners, in a bid to make money as quickly as possible.  Lessons should also be drawn about how to create an environment in which scientific research is conducted and technological innovations are pursued with the right attitude.  This is of particular importance at a time when breakthroughs in core technologies, those in information technology in particular, have been emphasized as being badly needed so the country is not dependent on others.  That requires honesty and integrity in domestic research and development to produce genuine innovations.         "
Right attitude required for positive results from talks: China Daily editorial,8/16/2018,"                      In a move that offers a faint ray of hope that they will be able to resolve their trade differences, China and the United States are to hold a fresh round of trade talks — although at a lower level than previous rounds.  To those for whom the glass is always half full, extending an invitation to China is a sign that the Donald Trump administration might be softening its stance and genuinely seeking an end to the dispute.  Whether that is the case, or the discussions prove a damp squib as the more pessimistic predict, depends on how sincere Washington is in seeking shared ground.  Given what happened after the two sides’ last talks in Washington, when the US administration turned round and said it didn’t like the agreement that had been reached, there is a big question mark about whether the Trump administration is serious about easing the frictions or whether it is simply going through the motions to give the impression that it is amenable to compromise.  Since its about-face in May, the US administration has intensified its coercion-based approach of escalating tariff threats to try and force China to concede to its position.  China, on its part, has been responding quid pro quo making it clear that it will not be intimidated.  But while it will not be forced to make concessions, China welcomes dialogue and communication to find a way to defuse the crisis that is promising to spark a full-scale trade war, a scenario that is in the interests of neither country.  For the talks to be credible, the US has to engage in them with sincerity and goodwill, and set aside its habit of condescension and dispute.  Despite the relatively low level of the planned talks, if the discussions are conducted on the basis of reciprocity, equality and integrity, there is no reason why they cannot make some practical progress and lay a solid foundation for higher-level talks between the two sides with a view to finalizing a deal.  However, once bitten, twice shy — it is right that Beijing should not only listen to what Washington says, but also watch what it does in order to assess its real intentions given what transpired after their last talks.

Yasukuni Shrine tributes not conducive to bettering ties: China Daily editorial,8/15/2018,"                          Shinto priests are pictured in the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, Japan August 15, 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.[Photo/Agencies]   By choosing to send his customary donation to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo on the anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proved that old habits die hard.  His stubbornness in persisting with the controversial practice does not help Japan and its neighbors put the past behind them.  No matter in what form, the Japanese leader’s commemorative activity is a bitter reminder of the brutality that Japan inflicted on its neighbors as it pursued its imperial ambitions.  The politics of remembrance are difficult for both Japan and Germany given the documented atrocities they committed as a result of perverted ideologies. While there is a natural desire to remember the dead, it is difficult for them to justify honoring them, given the crimes that stain the reputations of all who fell.  And it is in this regard that Abe and others who pay homage at the Yasukuni Shrine continue to add insult to injury, for among the 2.5 million Japanese war dead from that period are 14 Class-A war criminals, which is what Japan’s neighbors find particularly objectionable about Japanese politicians’ acts of obeisance to the shrine.  The shrine itself has become a potent symbol of militaristic nationalism. Japan’s politicians would do well to dissociate themselves from it, as its glorification of militarism and historical revisionism does not instill faith they are sincere about improving ties with neighboring countries. Especially since they find some facts slippery and difficult to hold on to.  If Japan really wants to improve mutual trust with neighboring countries and realize reconciliation over the contentious historical issues, it should do more to convince its neighbors that it has truly faced up to its past.  The 40th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship was marked a few days ago, and both Beijing and Tokyo made efforts to improve relations in the run-up to that occasion — relations have been severely strained in recent years, partly because of Japan’s desire to obscure historical issues.  Premier Li Keqiang’s visit to Japan in May was widely perceived as an important step forward in this regard. Both sides should continue to build on the desirable momentum in bilateral ties that was fostered during his trip as a rapprochement would not only cater to the interests of both countries but also serve to promote stability and development in the region as a whole.

Malaysia projects viable and mutually beneficial: China Daily editorial,8/15/2018,"                          Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaks during an interview with Reuters in Putrajaya, Malaysia June 19, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   Some remarks made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad prior to his upcoming five-day visit to China that begins on Friday have raised concerns that the Sino-Malaysian strategic partnership might not realize its full potential.  Referring to the $20 billion East Coast Rail Link and two energy pipeline projects worth more than $2.3 billion, the 93-year-old Malaysian leader said on Monday, “We don’t think we need those two projects. We don’t think they are viable. So if we can, we would like to just drop the projects.”  Work on the projects has been halted pending discussions over the cost amid accusations of graft against the previous administration of Najib Razak, who now faces multiple charges.  For 44 years since the two countries established diplomatic relations, China and Malaysia have conducted cooperation based on integrated interests that have brought immense benefits to both sides. China is now Malaysia’s biggest trading partner, while Malaysia has accumulatively invested $7.58 billion in China, which surpasses China’s investment in Malaysia.  The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative offers new prospects for mutual benefits. The East Coast Rail Link serves as a good example of this. A feasibility study carried out over a period of six years suggests that the project, due to be completed by 2024, will boost regional connectivity and propel the economy of Malaysia’s eastern region — which lags behind the rest of the country — as 5.4 million passengers and 53 million metric tons of cargo are expected to use the 668-kilometer electrified rail service annually by 2030. It is also expected to create 80,000 jobs locally.  It is therefore too hasty a judgment, and one based more on conjecture than concrete facts, to infer that Chinese companies have benefited unfairly at the cost of Malaysia’s interests. Any act to renege on the deals on the unproved premise that Malaysia is being ripped off by China will not only incur heavy economic losses for both sides, but also put the credit of Malaysia in jeopardy as it runs against the spirit of contract.  However, it is normal that even friendly neighbors cannot always see eye to eye on some issues. China and Malaysia have supported each other in times of adversity, and their trade and economic links have never been stronger. Hopefully, the two countries will resolve the issue during Mahathir’s visit.         "
What China is doing in Xinjiang is being deliberately distorted: China Daily editorial,8/14/2018,"                          A villager picks roses in a rose field in Hotan, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, June 6, 2018. The rose industry has increased the income of local people. [Photot/Xinhua]   To foreigners, foreign media in particular, who have misinterpreted or even exaggerated the security measures China has taken in its Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, we say that only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches.  As outsiders, they do not appreciate that tight security measures are badly needed to prevent the country’s far-west from being turned into an abyss of chaos. The terrorist attacks that have taken place there in recent years, and the ones committed elsewhere in the country by terrorists from that region, portends such a possibility.  Some Uygurs, who harbor the intention of splitting the region from China and turning it into an independent country, spread false stories about how their fellow residents are suffering and being detained or arrested due to draconian security measures. They consider smearing the image of China and its government in this way to be part of their mission.  It is impossible for foreign reporters to get a whole picture of what is happening in the region from such misinformation. Yet that is what they claim to be doing when airing the accusation of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that Xinjiang is a “no rights” zone.  It is true that China shows no leniency in cracking down on terrorists and extremists in Xinjiang and other parts of the country. It is also true that China has tightened security in Xinjiang as it is badly needed to squeeze the space for terrorists and extremists, especially with Islamic State fighters dispelled from Iraq and Syria spreading their poison in the wider region.  Yes, the government in Xinjiang is trying to prevent terrorist attacks and curb extremism, but to claim the government can detain 1 million Uygurs, the largest ethnic group, in the region is far-fetched.  Those Uygur secessionists and extremists will continue to do what they can to tarnish the reputation of China and its government. In their eyes, nothing China has done and is doing in Xinjiang is right. If foreign reporters prefer to believe what they hear, they will continue to harbor prejudice against China on the matter and turn a blind eye to the government’s efforts to consolidate the unity of all ethnicities in the autonomous region.  However, the country will continue to do whatever it believes is in the interests of the majority of people of different ethnicities in the region and of the nation as a whole.         "
Policing of investments will not benefit US: China Daily editorial,8/14/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump delivers remarks to a group of young adults at the White House in Washington, DC on June 27, 2018.[Photo/VCG]   US President Donald Trump signed into law the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act on Monday, strengthening the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to police proposals of foreign investment on the grounds of national security.  It is widely perceived to be targeting China, since the Trump administration has repeatedly blocked Chinese investment in high-tech industry alleging Chinese investments are a threat and accused Beijing of “unfair” trade and intellectual property practices that cheat the system.  China has consistently denied the accusations and some US tech companies that have operations in China backed its avowals of innocence at a hearing organized by the US Trade Representative in late July, testifying that they had not been forced to transfer their technologies to their Chinese partners as the Trump administration has claimed.  National security is rightly the top concern of any country, but it is too often willfully used as a political tool by Washington, which has become alarmed at China’s growing economic strength and its bid to move Chinese industry up the value chain.  Foreign investment creates jobs and gives a boost to an economy. According to consulting and research firm Rhodium Group, for example, Chinese investment in the US created 140,000 new jobs in 2016.  The new act will only further disincentivize Chinese enterprises from investing in the US, their enthusiasm having already been dampened by the ongoing trade frictions.  In the first half of this year, acquisitions and green field investments by Chinese companies totaled only $1.8 billion, a drop of more than 90 percent compared with a year ago and the lowest level in seven years, according to Rhodium.  In essence, the Trump administration‘s bid to hinder China’s development is rooted in an ossified mentality that is unable to adapt to the relative decline of the US since its corporate excesses sparked the global financial crisis.  By restricting Chinese investment, the Trump administration claims to be protecting US interests and holding high the banner of discontent at the bottom of US society. But since it is one that puts the interests of shareholder America first, it has packaged it in a patriotic wrapper to sell it, as it does not address the fundamental problem in the US — the widening wealth gap and a society shaped like an asymmetrical hour glass with a nipped waist that denies hopes of upward mobility.  China is not the cause of the US’ woes, so the wall the Trump administration is constructing against Chinese imports and investments is not going to be the cure-all it has promised.         "
Moon hard-pressed to bridge US-DPRK expectations gap: China Daily editorial,8/13/2018,"                          ROK Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon (R) shakes hands with his DPRK counterpart Ri Son-gwon at the border village of Panmunjom, Aug 13, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   So the sitting leaders of the two Koreas will meet again in September in Pyongyang.  The third inter-Korean summit in a little more than five months is a sign of the continuing rapprochement across the 38th Parallel, and it is expected to make substantial headway toward officially ending the Korean War, which concluded with an armistice in 1953, leaving the two Koreas technically at war.  But that is no insurance the seeds Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in have sown together will grow into big trees, as Ri Son-gwon, the DPRK's chief delegate, wishes. Let alone a formal peace treaty, since even substantial further engagement between Pyongyang and Seoul may prove unrealistic without wholehearted endorsement by the United States, a key party in that war.  The present state of relations between Washington and Pyongyang, however, does not seem to support substantial progress in that direction. Despite the initial optimism following the high-profile meeting between US President Donald Trump and the DPRK leader in Singapore, the international community is yet to see any meaningful result, except for occasional rhetoric about hopes.  More recently, as that wave of enthusiasm ebbs, the two parties appear to have reverted to their decades-old blame game. While Pyongyang accuses Washington of a lack of sincerity and taking a ""gangster-like"" approach with its sanctions, the latter shows no intention of easing its stance of ""maximum pressure"".  President Moon has been praised for initiating and then salvaging the once impossible summit meeting between Trump and Kim. It will entail similar diplomatic skills for him to keep the two parties engaged in meaningful dialogue, and ensure that engagement produces tangible movement toward denuclearization.  Pyongyang demolished a nuclear test site and then a missile launch facility. But those constructive gestures have been lost amid the recent suspicions that it is resuming nuclear activities. Washington, on its part, while wanting Pyongyang to make more convincing moves to denuclearize, has offered little in the way of incentives for it to do so. Should this pattern persist, things very likely will return to how they were.  Moon's mediation efforts will not succeed unless he finds a way to bridge the expectations gap.         "
Tsai cannot expunge fact that Taiwan part of China: China Daily editorial,8/13/2018,"                          Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen attends a news conference in Taipei April 11, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   Before her flight to Los Angeles, where she is making a stopover en route to Belize and Paraguay, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen spoke of remaining ""firm so that no one can obliterate Taiwan's existence"".  And she is right, Beijing must adamantly oppose her attempts to obliterate the truth of the island's existence.  Since her first day in office, Tsai has never stopped trying to obscure the fact that the island is not an independent country but part of China.  Yet although the two Latin American countries that she is visiting are among the few countries that remain on the wrong side of history, they are not the intended mediums for her message. Rather, Tsai intends to use her stopovers in the United States as the stage for her latest pro-independence push in a bid to shore up Washington's support ahead of local elections in Taiwan in November, as she has been facing increasing push back from Beijing against her antics and growing dissatisfaction among residents on the island.  Her visit comes at a time when Washington, which has its own agenda vis-à-vis Beijing, seems keen on goading her in her ambitions. US President Donald Trump appears set on playing the ""Taiwan card"" more aggressively as he seeks to keep what his administration perceives to be ""a challenge to American power"" on the back foot. His recent moves challenging the one-China policy, include signing the ""Taiwan Travel Act"" that aims to increase visits ""at all levels"" between US officials and members of the island's administration, have emboldened Tsai in her provocations of Beijing.  The island's education authority is now reviewing history textbooks for students and proposing to include China's history as part of East Asia history, so as to further erase the island's true identity.  But such attempts will gain her no reward. As Tsai's remarks on Sunday reveal, she and her administration have encountered setbacks in their bid to expand the space for the island's ""independence"". In one of the countermeasures Beijing has taken, the mainland civil aviation authority has instructed foreign airlines to ensure Taiwan is correctly identified as part of China on their websites, and almost all carriers have now complied.  Tsai should realize that ""independence"" is a red line that Beijing has drawn and she should not cross it. Indeed, the closer she seeks to edge toward it, the deeper the predicament she will find herself in.            "
US is making trouble with its unilateralist approach: China Daily editorial,8/12/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   It is no joke to call the US the United States of Sanctions, as wielding an economic cudgel seems to be Washington's preferred means of persuasion or punishment.  On Aug 7, it initiated a first round of sanctions on Iran after it announced its withdrawal from the hard-won multilateral deal on Iran’s nuclear program, and more sanctions targeting Iran's exports of oil are due to take effect in November if Iran fails to meet its demands.  One day later, it announced it was imposing sanctions against Russia in response to accusations that Moscow used a nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.  Early this month, it imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers over a detained US pastor who is being tried in Turkey on espionage and terror-related charges.  And from early June, it has been imposing unfair tariffs on imports from China and it continues to threaten more in its attempt to bring China to its knees. It has also imposed high tariffs on imports from other trade partners.  What can be discerned from all this are the arrogance and highhandedness of the US administration.  The US does not regard and treat other countries as deserving of respect. With such a mentality, the US government believes it can do whatever it pleases as it considers itself to be exceptional and above others.  But while it might try and claim the moral high ground, in reality, its actions are only propitious to itself.  The US sanctions and tariffs have trampled over international laws and the norms by which countries, large or small, strong or weak, should treat each other.  Rights abused are still rights, and it is not for the US to decide what rights a country may enjoy.  Its actions are based on wishful thinking rather than sound prevision, and it is trusting to careless confidence in its strength rather than reason since its unilateral economic pressure against other countries will also likely harm globalized free trade, which will quite probably plunge the entire world economy into recession.  And with the European Union retaliating against US tariffs and launching measures in response to the US sanctions against its companies doing business with Iran and Russia, US unilateralism is at the cost of its prestige and image as the world leader.

Proposed US space force will open Pandora's box: China Daily editorial,8/12/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   Exactly as he anticipated, the United States commander-in-chief made a ""big, breaking story"" last Monday as he ordered the Pentagon to establish a ""space force"" as the sixth branch of his country's military. About which he had previously been ""not really serious"".  Now it seems he is deadly serious –literally – that, a ""space force"" ""separate but equal"" to the US Air Force, should be established. He just needs to get the US Congress to amend Title 10 of the United States Code to create a brand-new military service. And convince congressional critics that an independent ""space force"" is a necessity for national security and worth the potentially astronomical input it would entail.  The US House of Representatives passed legislation last July authorizing establishment of a “space corps” within the US Air Force. The idea of a ""separate"" ""space force"" invites doubts because few view it as a national security imperative or believe it is advisable.  It is fine that Donald Trump wants to ""Make America Great Again"" in space, and see to it that ""America continues to lead the way into the stars"". It is also fine he, as the US president, does not want ""China and Russia and other countries leading us"". Each country is entitled to pursue a competitive edge in any area of competition.  But it is quite another story for the US commander-in-chief to consider space as ""a war-fighting domain"". Not to mention the US' notorious sense of insecurity that means it also likes to have absolute military superiority so it can throw its weight around. Unlike his earlier proposal to revive US space programs, return the US to the moon, even to explore Mars, defining space as a battlefront has the dangerous potential for opening a Pandora's box for militarizing it and triggering an arms race there.  It is true that the US is no longer the only country capable of certain maneuvers in Earth's orbit. But that potential can be used for constructive purposes and to advance peaceful human utilization of space resources if countries cooperate.  No country should expect absolute security in an exhaustive arms race. If the US president wants peace for his country, it is far more realistic and rewarding to concentrate on peace-making on earth and rethink his all-round assault on longstanding international institutions and arrangements than opening up a fresh frontier for animosities on Earth.

Canberra should now match its sweet talk with deeds: China Daily editorial,8/8/2018,"                          The national flags of China and Australia. [Photo/VCG]   In a welcome change of tone, high-ranking Australian politicians have begun to talk favorably about Australia's ties with China of late, and displayed a strong desire to maintain a good relationship with China. However, their sweet talking will need to be matched by suitable deeds to ensure the healthy development of bilateral cooperation.  In a speech at the University of New South Wales on Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull talked at length about his understanding of China and its continuing reform and opening-up and stressed the importance of Australia's ties with China, saying that his country looks forward to working with China on Belt and Road Initiative projects.  ""We're committed to working with China's leaders to advance our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, a great framework within which to advance our mutual and complementary interests,"" he said. He also stressed that Australia will continue to welcome students, tourists, researchers and investors from China.  Prior to Turnbull's speech, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop delivered the same message when meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers’ meeting and related meetings in Singapore.  Bishop said Australia attaches importance to ties with China and hopes to enhance mutual understanding and trust with China so as to promote all-round bilateral cooperation.  These overtures suggest that Canberra is now eying a rapprochement with Beijing after bilateral ties experienced some difficulty this year as a result of the anti-China sentiment fueled by the media and some Australian politicians' bias against Beijing, which has adversely impacted business interaction, Chinese investment in Australia, and even official communication between the two countries.  Obviously, the current undesirable picture does not cater to the interests of the two countries and peoples. China is always willing to maintain healthy and reciprocal relations with Australia as long as Australia sees China through a fair and just lens.  It has become Canberra's ingrained habit to follow Washington's lead. However, to enjoy the favors of good fortune requires changing with the times. And for Australia that means strengthening pragmatic cooperation with China.  It is hoped that the change in Canberra's rhetoric will be appropriately demonstrated to enhance trust and cooperation, so the two countries can turn a new page in their relations and focus on working together for their shared benefit and the good of the region.

Tsai can only blame herself for Taiwan’s troubles: China Daily editorial,8/7/2018,"                          Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen attends a news conference in Taipei April 11, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   Taiwan has reportedly upgraded its indigenous defense with a newly developed cruise missile tailor-made for strikes on coastal targets on the mainland. It is also reportedly anxious to develop its own attack submarines.  The island’s leader Tsai Ing-wen has also proposed hiking the 2019 defense budget by 5.6 percent, raising the island’s annual military spending from 1.9 percent to 2.16 percent of local GDP.  Yet knowing the limitations of her attempts at boosting the island’s “defense self-sufficiency”, Tsai is working on multiple fronts to bolster her resistance against the mainland.  She has tried to solicit international sympathy, exaggerating the “threat” from across the Taiwan Straits, portraying the mainland as a common menace to global well-being.  And under her auspices, authorities on the island are reportedly deliberating on a retaliatory scheme to punish international air carriers that have complied with the request by the Civil Aviation Administration of China that they stop referring to Taiwan as an entity separate from China.  These might boost Tsai’s image in the eyes of those who seek confrontation with the mainland. But they have fittingly been ridiculed as “downright stupid” on the internet.  Even if Tsai bets substantially more on “defense self-sufficiency”, it will not be sufficient for the degree of security she envisions in the event of a cross-Straits showdown.  It is simply beyond her reach to bridge the continuously widening cross-Straits military capability gap. Let alone erase the international jurisprudential truth that Taiwan is not an independent sovereign entity but part of China. Not to mention that, as many have pointed out, its idea to create trouble for international airlines operating in Taiwan will only end up hurting local passengers.  Since assuming the island’s leadership, the headstrong Tsai has found herself mired deeper and deeper in a vicious circle over relations with Beijing. While inviting escalating pressure from across the Straits, she has witnessed her anti-mainland policies backfire at home.  The island of Kinmen, for instance, has begun to receive water supplies from the mainland’s Fujian province in defiance of her intimidation. The local magistrate is even talking about the possibility of building a bridge connecting his island to the mainland.  Her inability to deliver tangible benefits to local communities, together with the mainland’s generous offers of lucrative new opportunities, will continue to bring such embarrassments to Tsai, until she repents and changes course.

HK media club out of order in its pursuit of headlines: China Daily editorial,8/7/2018,"                          File photo of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong.[Photo/IC]   The frenzy in the Western media over the official stance of the Chinese government regarding the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong inviting a known separatist as guest speaker at a luncheon is contrived and ideologically motivated.  The official statement issued by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the FCC announced its accommodating gesture toward an advocate of Hong Kong separatism was not only justified but also necessary, as it would have sent the wrong message if it said nothing.  Chan Ho-tin, the guest invited by the club to give a speech, is the head of the Hong Kong National Party, an unregistered political group pursuing “Hong Kong independence”, that is connected to and colluding with other separatist forces and openly seeking to “damage Chinese interests”.  The FCC said in a statement that it believes its members and the public “have the right — and in the case of journalists, the professional responsibility — to hear the views of different sides in any debate”.  But by claiming it does not necessarily endorse what is being said, and it is merely defending the right to say it, it is being disingenuous and dissembling.  The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region stipulates that the rights and freedoms of residents, including freedom of speech, are safeguarded, but, as in other places, only in accordance with law.  When it comes to expressing political views, while the law may not control what you say, it can delineate where, when and how you say it.  None of the civil and political rights and basic freedoms protected by the Basic Law and local laws is absolute or unlimited, meaning they cannot be used as excuse to facilitate attempts to challenge China’s sovereignty, which the law states is inalienable.  That it only invited Chan to be a guest speaker after the secretary for security of the SAR government confirmed he was considering a recommendation by the Hong Kong Police Force to stop the operation of the HKNP according to Section 8 of the Societies Ordinance, shows the colonial-era club is simply trying to be provocative.  But there is little public support for its stunt. An opinion poll conducted on Monday shows that 84 percent of the respondents think it is inappropriate for the FCC to invite an advocate of “Hong Kong independence” to be a guest speaker.  The Western media must realize the FCC has no special privilege and it should act maturely instead of providing a platform for those who are inciting people to break the law.         "
Washington's approach to agreements abnormal: China Daily editorial,8/6/2018,"                          Photo taken on Aug 4, 2018 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at a press conference on the sidelines of the 51st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting (AMM) in Singapore. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vows on Aug 5, 2018 that the United States would ""enforce the sanctions"" it is reimposing against Iran after President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear pact. [Photo/VCG]   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said over the weekend that the United States is set to revive sanctions on Iran that were previously lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal reached between the Middle East country and the so-called P5+1 group of powers.  Speaking on Sunday on his way home from a three-nation trip to South East Asia, Pompeo told reporters on the plane that the US administration is ready to reimpose the sanctions and that they will be rigorously enforced until the Iranian government radically changes course.  Using the now familiar rhetorical tropes of the Donald Trump administration, he said that they were hopeful they could find a way forward ""but it's going to require enormous change on the part of the Iranian regime"". Which he helpfully spelled out as meaning — ""They've got to behave like a normal country.""  Which is the kettle calling the pot black.  It is the US whose actions are against international norms.  The Trump administration has no legal or moral grounds for unilaterally scrapping the deal (and this is not the first time it has gone back on such a diplomatic handshake).  In each of its nine reports since the deal was inked, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the international nonproliferation watchdog, has confirmed that Teheran has been in full compliance with the deal.  Rather than it being the Iranian regime that has committed ""multiple violations of the agreement"", it is the Trump administration that has violated it, stomping out of the room like a spoiled child that doesn’t want to play fair when called on to do so.  Reimposing sanctions will only make the already hostile atmosphere between the US and Iran even more combustible. In response to the US threat to ban Iranian oil exports from Nov 4, Iran has said that it will not talk with the US under coercion and it has all but threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz.  A head-on clash between Washington and Teheran, even if on a limited scale, or the regime change the former is seemingly pursuing, will only further exacerbate the already fragile situation in the Middle East and produce dire consequences that even Washington might find hard to swallow.  The Iran deal, verified and approved by the United Nations Security Council, must be respected and safeguarded. Honoring agreements and commitments is the appropriate behavior of any normal country.         "

Constructive engagement key to South China Sea stability: China Daily editorial,8/5/2018,"                                                 China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi (6th from L) poses with Ministers of Foreign Affairs from other ASEAN countries during a bilateral meeting at the 51st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting in Singapore on Aug 2, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Summing up his impressions of the foreign ministers meetings on East Asia cooperation that just concluded in Singapore, chief Chinese diplomat Wang Yi highlighted a sharp contrast: a ""very successful and smooth""10+3 session and a 10+8 session that displayed ""some negative tendencies"".  The 10+3 mechanism convenes the 10 ASEAN member countries and China, Japan and Republic of Korea. The 10+8 incorporates Australia, India, New Zealand, Russia and the United States with the 10+3.  Wang's appraisal highlighted that as countries in the region press ahead with cooperation and seek to ensure peace and stability in the South China Sea, some ""extra-regional countries""constitute a threat to the entire region.  In a break from a previous convention, where Beijing avoided identifying any offending party, Wang on Saturday identified the US as the ""foremost driver of the region's militarization"", criticizing Washington for saber-rattling by frequently sending large-scale strategic weapons into the region. Accusing China of militarizing South China Sea, Wang said, is ""calling white black"", Beijing is only acting in a defensive manner under corresponding pressure.  As with the ongoing tit-for-tat actions between China and the US on trade, the exchange of words surrounding allegations of militarization may escalate. But a solution can hardly be found without addressing a deeper problem: The traditional geopolitical paradigm is increasingly incompatible with changing conditions, worsening major-country relations and the amplifying of strategic misperceptions.  In his separate talks with US State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Wang again elaborated on Beijing's position, and urged the latter parties not to misread its intentions. This may be easier said than done. But it is essential if there is to be constructive engagement.  And whether or not that engagement materializes will determine whether the waters become a highly charged crucible for major-power contention, or a new venue for collaboration.  The present tensions over the South China Sea and the broader region have much to do with the concerned parties viewing the South China Sea through the Cold War-era concept of sphere of influence.  Since each of them claims a commitment to peace and stability of the region, what matters then is how they actually behave.  The most revealing immediate test is how countries respond to the latest positive developments seen in Singapore at the meetings, whether they facilitate their fruition of those developments or hinder them.

Tariffs to repay blow if US makes good on threat: China Daily editorial,8/5/2018,"                                             The tariffs Beijing announced it would slap on US imports on Friday was a response to Washington's threat to raise its previously announced pending tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent on Chinese imports worth $200 billion.  If, when and how China's tariffs – which range from 5 percent to as high as 25 percent on $60 billion worth of US imports – will be implemented depends on if and how the United States proceeds with its tariff threat.  True, the blow Beijing will punch in return is not as heavy as the one Washington is proposing. However, it is not a matter of whose blow is heavier. It is a matter of where the blow is struck. That is what China has taken into consideration in deciding its response.  The differentiated tariffs it has announced that it will retaliate with mean that Chinese enterprises and residents will not suffer too much because of the tariffs, and the global supply chains will not be too seriously affected.  In the face of the bullying of the Donald Trump administration, Beijing must remain sober-minded and never let emotion override reason when deciding how to respond to the US administration's unreasonable and insensible self-promoting hullabaloo.  China has long insisted that trade disputes should be settled through talks and a trade war is naturally the last thing it wants. That is why it has reiterated on different occasions that it will not fire the first shot. And why it has repeated time and again that it will always keep the door open for negotiations.  But that does not mean that China is afraid of a trade war and it will acquiesce to the US' protection racket. Given China's huge market, its systemic advantage of being able to concentrate resources on big projects, its people's tenacity in enduring hardships and its steadiness in implementing reform and opening-up policies, the country can survive a trade war.  However, the Chinese authorities still consider the retaliatory tariffs as a means not the end. As an old Chinese saying goes, it is not courteous to not repay a blow from a rival.  The announcement that Beijing will retaliate if necessary is a reminder to Washington that China will never buy its threats but it is willing to negotiate on an equal footing.  Unless it gives up its arrogant trade posture, the US should not expect any concession from China.         "
Country playing its part for a low-carbon world: China Daily editorial,8/2/2018,"                      Much of China continues to swelter in scorching heat and will continue to do so until the middle of next week, according to the National Meteorological Center. Elsewhere across the northern hemisphere, prolonged heat waves are already wreaking havoc on an unprecedented scale. From Europe to Africa, and from Asia to North America, there have been increasing numbers of extreme droughts and wildfires, as well as rising death tolls from heat-stress. While some people still dispute the cause of the abnormally hot weather, most point to human induced climate change as the culprit. This was corroborated again by the annual State of the Climate Report released on Wednesday. Compiled by more than 450 scientists from over 60 countries, it states the top three most dangerous greenhouse gases released into the Earth’s atmosphere — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — reached record highs in 2017. “The global growth rate of CO2 has nearly quadrupled since the early 1960s,” says the 300-page report released by the American Meteorological Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, giving lie to US President Donald Trump’s claim that climate change is a Chinese “hoax” aimed at destroying the competitiveness of US factories, one of the reasons he cited for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. Facts are stubborn things, and good decisions are based on knowledge of them, not opinion. The irresponsible acts of the Trump administration in withdrawing the US from the hard-won agreement secured in Paris and its weakening of environmental safeguards in the US, have not deterred China from assuming its due responsibilities in fighting climate change. Average temperatures in China have gone up 1.35 C since 1950, nearly double the average global increase, making it among the countries that are facing the most severe consequence from global warming. Most parts of the North China Plain could become uninhabitable toward the end of the century due to rising temperatures, according to the results of research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released on Tuesday. This makes it imperative that China — which already has the world’s largest installed capacity of wind and solar power — continues to promote non-fossil fuel energy and works together with other countries to implement the Paris accord and curb harmful emissions, for a low-carbon world concerns not only China’s interests, but also the future of mankind.

"China, ASEAN show shared resolve for rules-based region: China Daily editorial",8/2/2018,"                          China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi (6th from L) poses with Ministers of Foreign Affairs from other ASEAN countries during a bilateral meeting at the 51st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting in Singapore on Aug 2, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The foreign ministers of China and ASEAN sent the unmistakable message that the two sides are determined to steadily push for a rules-based mechanism to safeguard peace and stability in the waters when they announced they had agreed on an initial negotiating draft for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea at their meeting in Singapore on Thursday.  This initial draft will form the basis for future negotiations on the text of the Code of Conduct. Considering that a framework for such a code was adopted just a year ago, the agreement on the draft shows China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are sincere and earnest in reaching a consensus and smoothing the way for talks.  But although this has been rightly hailed as a new milestone, it would be unrealistic to expect a swift conclusion to the negotiations, as they involve complex and sensitive issues.  Nevertheless, there is no reason to believe that China and ASEAN will relent in their efforts to uphold the hard-won progress in their negotiations on a Code of Conduct as doing so is in the interests of both sides. As long as they continue to shore up trust and properly manage their differences, their efforts to ensure the South China Sea is a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship will undoubtedly pay off.  In the meantime, China and the members of ASEAN should reject any attempts by those from outside the region to stir up trouble and undermine their efforts to safeguard peace and stability and enhance their cooperation and connectivity.  In recent years, the United States and some of its allies that have been trying to drive a wedge between ASEAN and China, and increased the risk of mishap, by strengthening their military presence and intensifying their military maneuvers in the region.  Their provocative moves pose a threat to the regional peacemaking efforts. Both China and the ASEAN members should remain vigilant and ensure that the current desirable momentum in regional cooperation is not sabotaged or disrupted and that the free and open trade in the region is not compromised by the US’ unilateralist trade policies or its divisive and exclusive Indo-Pacific strategy.

Economic policy remains on course despite headwinds: China Daily editorial,8/1/2018,"                      Although policymakers are set to fine-tune it to cope with the headwinds being encountered both at home and abroad, China’s basic economic policy stance is to remain largely unchanged. According to the statement issued after the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on Tuesday, in the second half of this year, the country will seek to “maintain a stable economic and social situation” and adhere to the basic principle of “seeking progress while maintaining stability”. The statement said the country will continue to adopt a pro-active fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy with the aim of maintaining stable and healthy economic development. From this, it is clear that the macroeconomic regulatory stance remains fundamentally unchanged. But as policymakers at the meeting warned, deepening economic restructuring and the rising tide of global trade protectionism have combined to put downward pressure on China’s growth potential. Domestically, the debt-cutting initiative has led to continual tightening of financial regulation, which has led to reduced liquidity and risked exacerbating financial exposure. Internationally, the continuing China-US trade confrontation has affected China’s exports and GDP growth this year. Tuesday’s meeting sent a message that fiscal policy is to play a bigger role in expanding domestic demand and promoting economic restructuring. Monetary policy, meanwhile, will also be adjusted to ensure liquidity is “reasonably ample” to ensure the country’s growth can be kept “within a reasonable range”. Meanwhile, it was determined at the meeting that the country will improve its policy “foresight, flexibility and effectiveness” and better manage the “pace and intensity” of deleveraging to redress the adverse effects of the policy. Liquidity loosening, however, may bring new challenges as the increased money may flow into asset investments such as real estate, as past experiences have shown. Policymakers, therefore, have made a pre-emptive move by saying at Tuesday’s meeting that property price rises should be “resolutely stemmed”, wording that is in stark contrast with previous claims that property prices should be prevented from “rising excessively fast”. Given that property prices in major cities have skyrocketed in the past decade, only by strictly controlling money flowing into asset investments can the loosened monetary stance be properly used to boost the real economy, maintain stable growth and ward off the eruption of major financial risks.         "
China will not give in to US’ new trade extortion: China Daily editorial,8/1/2018,"                          [Photo/IC]   It is nothing more than gangsterism for the Donald Trump administration to indicate it is considering raising the pending tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from the 10 percent to 25 percent.  News the administration might jack up the tariffs came immediately after reports that the two countries were going to return to the negotiating table. The timing betrays the US has no qualms about trying to squeeze as much as it can from its trade partners with crude strong-arm tactics.  But the US government is wrong if it believes that China will give in to its trade shakedown. However high it jackscrews the tariffs it imposes on Chinese imports, China will not cave in to the pressure and will retaliate in kind to the best of its ability.  Its stance is consistent and unambiguous, it will accept negotiation, but it will not pander to rapaciousness.  If the US government sincerely wants to settle the trade frictions through talks, it should show its sincerity. There is no bona fides in saying “let’s talk a deal” while using threats.  By presenting the possibility of ending the dispute through talks, while denying that outcome by making impossible demands, the US administration is being duplicitous.  Its contrivance will only stoke the fires of resentment at home as US farmers, companies and consumers will feel increasing pain the longer the trade frictions continue.  While the Trump administration has already announced it will provide $12 billion in emergency aid to ease the misery of US farmers brought about by the tariffs, the US Chamber of Commerce estimates that another $27.2 billion would be required to prop up other sectors battered by the retaliatory tariffs from the US’ trade partners.  How big a Band-Aid is the Trump administration prepared to provide to try and prove a point that is wrong in the first place?  There are always remedies worse than the disease. If the US takes measures to further escalate this situation, China will undoubtedly respond with countermeasures.  The US administration likes to wave the flag of nationalism, claiming it wants to make “America Great Again” — no doubt in an all-caps tweet exuding faux sincerity — but by wrapping its trade blows with the Stars and Stripes it is being neither patriotic nor honorable, since the sole object is bullied gains.  If the administration really wants to make America great again, it should start by buffing up the country’s image by acting in good faith and demonstrating it is sincere about wanting to secure an end to the trade dispute through talks.

"Talks, not threats, would be good for US and Iran: China Daily editorial",7/31/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters at the White House after signing a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, May 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   US President Donald Trump just made his ninth offer to meet leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, saying he would meet them ""anytime they want"", with ""no preconditions"".  Trump's previous eight offers were refused, and for most people it seems this one, too, is likely to meet the same fate, as it comes before Washington is due to reinstate sanctions on Iran next month.  Teheran has indicated it has no intention of taking part in ""one-sided negotiations"" while under threat, and said the United States would have to return to the nuclear deal and reduce hostilities before it would consider a meeting.  Despite the opposition he has faced at home, the US president is perfectly comfortable with seeking engagement with the leaders of states the US has long regarded as pariah states, he is even proud of it. But this about-face does require some nifty footwork to keep in step with, since it was just 10 days ago that he was threatening Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with ""consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before"" in an all-capital-letter tweet.  This was fittingly referred to as ""fire and fury 2.0"", as it was similar to Trump's threat to Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un, which Trump claims brought Kim to Singapore for talks.  So rather than being just posturing prior to the US midterm elections, as some have suggested, more likely than not Trump is sticking to what he regards as a highly effective formula — extending an olive branch while exerting ""maximum pressure"".  If that is the case, a meeting may not be beyond the realms of possibility. For just as he warned the US ""war with Iran is the mother of all wars"" earlier this month, Rouhani also stated ""peace with Iran is the mother of all peace"".  Since both parties have expressed a desire for peace, the only thing to be sorted out is how to achieve it — that means talking.  The two sides need to overcome the mistrust that has built up over the years — which has been exacerbated by Trump pulling the US out of the nuclear deal — and iron out their differences. They can only do that by exchanging views rather than threats.  Trump said of a potential meeting with Rouhani that it would be ""good for them, good for us, and good for the world"", it would certainly be a step toward easing the accumulating tensions between the US and Iran. The other parties to the nuclear agreement should encourage Washington and Teheran to get together as it really would be good to talk.         "
Trump should realize change of approach in US interests: China Daily editorial,7/30/2018,"                          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and US President Donald Trump speak to the news media in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, US, July 25, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The US treasury secretary insisted on Sunday that agricultural issues were discussed in the talks between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. It is a claim that contradicts the EU Commission president's account of the negotiations.  ""I was in the room and we had specific conversations about agriculture and the need to break down the barriers on agriculture and have more opportunities for our farmers,"" Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.  They may indeed have talked about more than soybeans when discussing agriculture, but, as EU commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva has said, if you look at the joint statement that was released by the two sides while farmers and soybeans are mentioned, there is ""no mention of agriculture as such"" in their agreement.  After the acrimonious exchanges between the two sides in the run-up to the talks, in which Trump went so far as to call the EU ""a foe"" of the US, their honeyed words last week seemed to indicate they had patched up their differences. Now it appears that is not the case.  US farmers have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on US imports, particularly soybeans, so Trump's claim on Thursday that the talks opened up Europe for US farmers will no doubt have been met with huge sighs of relief and taken some of the domestic pressure off his administration.  However, while US soybeans may soon be on EU menus, that the bloc has agreed to dine on other US agricultural products is harder to swallow.  It would certainly be difficult for Juncker to convince the EU producers of agricultural products that such a deal would be in their interests.  French President Emmanuel Macron has openly expressed his opposition to any ""vast new trade deal"" between the EU and the US, and his sentiment was echoed by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.  It seems that once again, as it did after its talks with China, the Trump administration wants to take more than was agreed.  China and the US reached a trade agreement after talks in Beijing and Washington in May. However, that proved short-lived as the US administration soon decided that having got an agreement it would be able to get more.  Some argue that it will be different this time because the EU is a longtime US ally, but it will only take a tweet from the US president to make the consensus null and void.  The latest war of words between the US and the EU shows once again that the crux of the matter is the approach of the Trump administration. Instead of pursuing its unilateralism it should join with China and the EU to work together to build an open world economy in which all benefit.         "
Twisting facts will not help straighten China-US trade,7/29/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   When Andy Puzder said in an opinion piece for Fox News on Saturday that it was China that had launched a trade war against the United States 18 years ago, he repeated the platitudes often made about China's trade surplus with the US.  Simply put, he claimed that the US has been ripped off by China in their bilateral trade over the past nearly two decades. He said that China blocked US goods from entering its market, China forced US companies to transfer technology and stole commercial secrets.  How can bilateral trade between the world largest and second largest economies last for nearly two decades with the former having been a loser and the latter the beneficiary all the time? If that were the case, their trade relations would not have lasted. No previous US president and their economic advisors would have been foolish enough to allow the US economy to suffer all the time from its trade deficit with China. If they did, they would not have been in the American people's good graces.  When China opened its door to the outside world in the late 1970s, the economic engagement between China and the US met each other's needs: China needed capital and technology while the US needed to outsource its manufacturing and find new markets for its products. Like the pin and tail of a joint their needs dovetailed.  For China, the result was the rise of ""made in China"" , which created a lot jobs for China and helped a great deal in lifting millions of Chinese out of poverty, while at the same time providing the world with reasonably priced consumer goods, US consumers in particular. What has been particularly noteworthy in this process has been the fact that transnational companies, those from the US especially, have benefitted a great deal by investing in China.  There has never been one-way trade between the two countries, and China is not a free rider and neither is the US. There has been a point of convergence where the interests of both have met, and this has made it possible for bilateral trade relations to remain general smooth over the past four decades, especially in the past nearly two decades since China's accession into the World Trade Organization in 2001.  There may be some problems that have emerged that need to be addressed. But it goes against the facts to say that China has long been ripping the US off in their bilateral trade. Pressuring China to capitulate to the US unreasonable demands by just pointing accusing fingers and twisting the facts will not help to straighten out bilateral trade relations.         "
Taiwan separatists to blame for politicizing sports event : China Daily editorial,7/26/2018,"                                             The Taiwan authority has only itself to blame for the decision by the East Asian Olympic Committee to cancel the East Asian Youth Games, which were due to be held in Taichung on the island next year. The decision was made at a special meeting of the EAOC in Beijing on Tuesday, with only Taiwan's representative at the meeting objecting. A spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on Wednesday that it was the right decision to cancel the games, which was due to some provocative actions by some groups on the island. After the decision was made, the Taiwan authority pointed an accusing finger at the mainland for ""dragging sport into politics"". But it is the separatists on the island, with the acquiescence, even encouragement of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party administration, who have tried to hijack the event to advocate Taiwan ""independence"". It is their shenanigans that are to blame for the decision not ""Beijing's bullying"". They have begun a campaign calling for a referendum on changing the name under which Taiwan athletes will compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games to ""Taiwan"" from ""Chinese Taipei"", which has been the agreement by both sides for previous Olympic events. The move is provocative and dangerous, as it challenges the principle of one China, which is the cornerstone for cross-Straits peace and stability. It also violates the rules by the International Olympic Committee governing Taiwan athletes' participation in the Olympic Games and other international events. The IOC has already made it clear that it would ""not approve the name change"" during an executive committee meeting in May. But that has obviously failed to end the delusions of the Taiwan separatists as they are persisting with their efforts to get enough signatures so that the referendum will go ahead. The ""Chinese Taipei"" arrangement, adopted by the IOC in a resolution in 1979, and later recognized by all other international sports federations, has made it possible for the island to remain a member of the international sports family for nearly four decades. The decision to cancel the youth games in Taichung serves to show that the efforts of Taiwan separatists to politicize sports are doomed to failure and they are beating their heads against a wall in trying to gain sanction from the international community for their denial of one China.

China seeks regeneration not dismantling of global system: China Daily editorial,7/26/2018,"                                                 President Xi Jinping addresses the BRICS Business Forum held in Johannesburg on Wednesday. He said it is an irreversible trend for emerging markets and developing nations to rise over the coming years. [Photo/Xinhua]   The 10th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg has demonstrated that the group of five emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - is placing even more emphasis on its partnership with Africa.  Five years ago when the 5th BRICS Summit was held in Durban, South Africa, the theme was ""BRICS and Africa"". Now it is ""BRICS in Africa"", highlighting the BRICS countries' shared commitment to the development of the continent, which is home to more developing countries than any other.  Boasting average growth of 5.3 percent and contributing more than half of the global growth in 2017, as well as their own experiences as latecomers, the BRICS economies are in a privileged position to help African countries chart their development courses. And the growing comprehensive strength of the BRICS countries supports their pledge to build the BRICS-Africa Partnership into a model for South-South cooperation.  China, as a leading beneficiary and proponent of free global trade and multilateral international cooperation, has a particular interest in helping Africa prosper because of its long-standing friendships with African countries. Beijing wants to dovetail the development strategies of African countries, along with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063, with the Belt and Road Initiative to accelerate the realization of the continent's development potential.  And, based on his strong conviction that the collective rise of emerging economies and developing countries is ""irresistible"", President Xi Jinping has urged BRICS and African nations to more proactively participate in the formulation of a new type of international relations in the face of profound changes ""not seen in centuries"".  Speaking at the BRICS Business Forum on Wednesday, he reiterated his call for countries to oppose unilateralism, protectionism, and economic hegemony, and stated unequivocally that China does not seek to overthrow the present world order. ""The current international order is not perfect,"" he said, but as long as it is based on rules, oriented at fairness, and aimed at win-win outcomes, ""it should not be discarded casually, still less should it be dismantled and built all over again"".  As Xi explained, what Beijing pursues is international rule-making that takes into full consideration the opinions of emerging economies and developing countries, and reflects their interests and appeals, so as to ensure there is enough room for their development.  BRICS owes its birth and development to the major changes unfolding in the world. In Johannesburg, Xi has once again emphasized that China rejects a beggar-thy-neighbor approach in favor of a better balanced global economy and multipolar international system that can form the framework for a community with a shared future for all mankind.

Companies have no leeway to skirt around one China: China Daily editorial,7/25/2018,"                                             Three months have passed since China's civil aviation authority wrote to more than 40 international airlines asking them to remove from their websites information that refers Taiwan as an independent country. Beijing's move did not come out of blue. It is in direct response to the increased push for the island's ""independence"" since Tsai Ing-wen and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party took office. The more she denies the 1992 consensus that agrees there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of it, the more Beijing will react by actively asserting that the island is an inalienable part of the country. So far most of the carriers that the Civil Aviation Administration of China wrote to have already complied with its instruction before the July 25 deadline, calling the island ""Taiwan, China"" or ""Chinese Taipei"". Although some of the late-doers are complying grudgingly. Some are reportedly using certain city names rather than referring to Taiwan as part of China. Whether this will be enough remains to be seen. Given the stern warning issued by a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday that acknowledging there is only one China is something ""nonnegotiable"", it is hard to imagine that it will be business as usual for those who take the instruction lightly. Even US operators such as Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which had been dragging their feet on the matter, are making the required changes. American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said in an email statement to Agence France Presse: ""Like other carriers, American is implementing changes to address China's request. Air travel is global business, and we abide by the rules in countries where we operate."" It is normal that enterprises should have to play by the rules in the countries where they operate. Yet unfortunately Washington has tried to paint the Chinese move in a bad light, calling it an effort by Beijing to ""impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens"", and describing it as ""Orwellian nonsense"". Such an arrogant attitude has sent a wrong signal. The White House forgets that it agreed to this political correctness as early as in 1972, when ""the United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China"", as the Shanghai Communiqué states. Thus Beijing's recent move is only restatement of a historical fact that all countries with normal relations with China must respect.         "
US being battered by its own trade blows: China Daily editorial,7/25/2018,"                                                 Wheat is harvested in Montana. [Photo/VCG]   So some pain relief is to finally be administered. In an admission that the escalating trade disputes it has initiated with China and other countries is hurting the United States, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday it will provide $12 billion in emergency aid to ease the misery of US farmers.  With the midterm elections coming up, there is a political consideration behind the Trump administration extending financial aid to US farmers, as it does not want to lose its support in the agricultural states.  It has become increasingly evident that US farmers have been hurt as a result of the Trump administration’s injudicious trade stance. If the disputes are prolonged, $12 billion will be far from enough to make up for the losses the US farmers will suffer. In addition, the government support for farmers is likely to prompt calls for similar treatment from other sectors that are suffering because of the trade frictions.  Yet while the government aid will no doubt be welcomed by farmers, it is a temporary painkiller not a cure for their ills. Many farmers have declared that they want markets for their crops, not payoffs for lost sales and lower prices.  As Republican Senator Charles Grassley, whose family operates a farm in eastern Iowa, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, the administration's move was ""encouraging for the short term""; however, farmers need ""markets and opportunity, not government handouts"".  Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue claimed the move is ""a short-term solution to allow President Trump time to work on long-term trade deals to benefit agriculture and the entire US economy"". But long-term deals mean sitting down and talking and making compromises. Instead, the Trump administration has decided to try and strong-arm the US' trade partners into conceding to its demands.  The US will not win with this approach. If the US government imposes further tariffs on more imports, retaliatory actions can be expected from the US' trade partners, and the losses US farmers and other sectors have endured so far will be just the beginning.  The US government cannot afford to bail out all the industries being battered, especially as the pain US industries in various sectors are suffering will become increasingly acute.  Even the most dogmatic physician will have to admit they made a mistake when the treatment causes the patient's condition to deteriorate. Hopefully, the cries of pain from farmers and industries in the US will let the Trump administration realize the folly of its ways.         "
More active fiscal policy will keep growth on track: China Daily editorial,7/24/2018,"                                             That the fiscal policy is to ""become more active"" should by no means be taken as an indication the government will resort to a deluge of stimulus policies, since to do so would only swell debt and increase the pressure on the economy. A statement issued after a meeting of the State Council on Monday, which was presided over by Premier Li Keqiang, indicates that policy fine-tuning will be undertaken to ensure the economy continues to grow within a reasonable range by boosting the development of the real economy and supporting domestic demand. That its pace of growth has stayed within the range of 6.7 to 6.9 percent for 12 straight quarters by the end of June reflects the resilience of the Chinese economy. And with consumption contributing 78.5 percent of the growth in the first half of the year according to the National Bureau of Statistics, it is successfully being weaned off its reliance on exports for growth. This restructuring means it is better positioned to withstand the impact of a trade war with the United States, which seems ever more likely with the Donald Trump administration threatening to impose tariffs on more Chinese imports. The more active fiscal policy will focus on giving a shot in the arm to the real economy with the government expanding a preferential policy for small technology companies to all enterprises. Coming on top of the initial goal of cutting taxes and fees by 1.1 trillion yuan ($162.58 billion) this year, this will effectively reduce the costs for businesses and ease their tax burden. The government will also quicken the issuing of 1.35 trillion yuan in special bonds for infrastructure projects, which will also add more impetus to the economy. While the readjusted fiscal and monetary policies will undoubtedly boost business confidence and keep China's economic growth on a relatively fast track in the near future, measures must also be taken to make sure they serve to improve the quality and efficiency of the economy. There are many lessons to learn from the past when loose credit inflated property bubbles worsened the overcapacity problems in many industrial sectors. To ensure those lessons are heeded, policymakers must keep the overall context in mind when implementing financial and fiscal policy measures, and they will have to stay true to the pledge to ""avoid strong stimulus"" and maintain a close eye on financial system irregularities.

Guaranteed safety first required to restore trust: China Daily editorial,7/24/2018,"                                                 A baby is vaccinated at a clinic in Cheng'an county, Hebei province. [Photo/Xinhua]   With both President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang issuing harsh, personal condemnations and ordering thorough investigations of the company at the heart of a vaccine scandal, the chairwoman and four senior executives of the Changchun Changsheng Bio-tech Company are now in police custody and under investigation for criminal liabilities.  Seeing some heads roll will certainly serve to pacify the public's anger. But this is not the first major vaccine-related scandal, and will that suffice to prevent another repeat?  Probably not. Because this is not a mere matter of one lawless company taking advantage of a porous quality guarantee regime.  While the culprit in this instance is undeniably Changchun Changsheng, and the company and its management must be held accountable, there will be no cure for the industry's maladies without finding out how the substandard products found their way into the market and installing reliable safeguards for the entire supply chain.  Especially after the repeated vaccine scandals have exposed so many loopholes and clues to corruption.  Given the de facto State monopoly over the vaccines market, where all vaccines are distributed via a supposedly tightly monitored official network of centers for disease control and prevention, no investigation will be complete without taking into account the inner workings of the channels through which vaccines reach the end user.  Like them or not, social media platforms are rife with possible clues as to what has led to the Changchun Changsheng revelations. While some may seem more speculative than substantive, those regarding system insiders’ apparent dereliction of duty, if not abuses of power, are worth special attention.  The authorities' vow of ""an explicit answer"" must be fulfilled, and effectively acted upon so it does not have to be made again in the future.  A decade ago, a scandal of melamine-contaminated baby formula milk dealt a devastating blow to the domestic dairy industry, leaving it struggling, until now, to win back consumer confidence.  The vaccine scandal is brewing a similar crisis of confidence in homemade vaccines, and raising concerns about whether the authorities have the capability to exert meaningful control.  The ""explicit"" answer to be presented must show they have. People's health should always be the top priority.         "
Strong treatment needed to remedy vaccine system: China Daily editorial,7/23/2018,"                                             If it is found that the company at the center of the vaccine scandal paid kickbacks to local disease prevention and control centers for the procurement of its vaccines, as reports claim, it clearly had no qualms about selling substandard vaccines.  And since the subsidy it received from the local government last year was 48.33 million yuan ($7.15 million), more than 10 times the fine it received when it was found in October to have produced defective batches of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, it would seem it had no reason to worry about the cost of its wrongdoing being discovered.  Especially since the vaccines it produced were tested by labs authorized by related authorities purely for their safety, not their effectiveness, so there is plenty of room to tamper with the vaccines to reduce their cost.  All these explain why problematic vaccines have repeatedly emerged in recent years.  Given the fact that problematic vaccine producers such as Changchun Changsheng Bio-tech Company, which is the producer in the news this time, always survive such scandals, we cannot but ask whether the relations are clean between the vaccine producers and local government officials.  As President Xi Jinping said on Monday, the investigation that has been launched must get to the bottom of the case so as to scratch the bone to get rid of the poison.  A special team is to investigate the vaccine chain from production to use, and the government has promised to keep people informed about the truth. This will no doubt help to get to the heart of the matter and reassure people that their questions will be answered.  However, even before the results of the investigation are announced, it is clear there are institutional loopholes and defects that have resulted in vaccine production becoming such a ruthless profit-seeking business that it may endanger people's lives.  Vaccines should be tightly controlled by the State and there should be no space for greed to be involved. Not just the culprits directly responsible for the problematic vaccines, but also those responsible for enabling the sector's misdeeds need to be caught. There will be no chance otherwise for the thorough overhaul of the sector that is needed. Vaccines are about people's lives and health, the quality cannot be allowed to be even a little defective, there should be zero tolerance for fake or junk vaccines.  The supervision of the central government over the production and use of vaccines should be enhanced with the implementation of more stringent production standards and stricter monitoring of the industry. And those found responsible for substandard production and cost-cutting operations should be severely punished to deter others. Profits must never come before lives.         "
Xi's visit to Africa will lift relations to higher level: China Daily editorial,7/22/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping, accompanied by Senegalese President Macky Sall, inspects the guard of honor at the airport in Dakar, Senegal, July 21, 2018. Xi arrived here Saturday for a state visit to Senegal. Sall held a grand welcome ceremony in Xi's honor. [Photo/Xinhua]   President Xi hailed the great dynamism of Africa when he arrived in Senegal on Saturday, the first stop on a four-country trip to Africa, that also takes him to Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius.  A key driver of this dynamism has been the boom in infrastructure projects managed and financed by China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to build a transport network spanning Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.  Over the past five years, China and African have made concerted efforts to advance their cooperation under the framework of this vision for common development, and Chinese investments into Africa have increased steadily: It is now the single largest contributor of foreign direct investment in Africa.  This has brought Beijing criticism from some quarters, with accusations from the West that African countries are in danger of being in thrall to Chinese debt.  However, such alarmist sentiments stem from African countries now looking firmly eastwards to China for their development inspiration and support rather than to the West for aid as they did in the past.  As Senegalese President Macky Sall told Xi on Saturday, China's development is a ""message of hope"" for the continent.  By advancing the Belt and Road Initiative in Africa, China and African countries are carrying forward their traditional friendship and creating a solid foundation for their growing reciprocal cooperation that will inject fresh vitality into the African continent's dynamism.  This will no doubt be further demonstrated and reinforced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation that is due to be held in Beijing in September. Coming as it does the back of Xi's trip, the forum provides a good opportunity for the two sides to further strengthen their ties and chart the future course of relations.  In an article published in the Senegalese newspaper Le Soleil ahead of his visit, Xi said ""the summit will break new grounds for China-Africa cooperation"" by bringing together the Belt and Road Initiative, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the national development plans of African countries.  With the alignment of these, China and African countries will be able to strengthen their cooperation and contribute even more to their common development and a shared future.         "
Transparency can help ease panic over vaccine scandal: China Daily Editorial,7/22/2018,"                                                 Photo from IC   The State Drug Administration’s statement on July 15 that Changchun Changsheng Bio-tech Company had fabricated the production records for its human rabies vaccine caused millions of people to panic as vaccines may be a matter of life and death.  After the SDA's announcement, Changsheng apologized for its deeds, saying it had suspended all production of its rabies vaccine. Yet a public apology is far from enough to iron out people’s distrust of the entire industry and the related mechanism, which has been contaminated by scandals.  But the company is already being fined over substandard production, uncovered in 2017, of its DPT vaccine.  It is therefore natural for people to question what the company has done and whether the vaccines it has produced can be labeled as “fake drugs” according to the law. They also have enough reason to ask whether the company has tampered with other vaccines it has produced in order to make more profits.           "
US risks being left behind as world embarks on new journey: China Daily editorial,7/19/2018,"                          Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signs a contract with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk at the Japanese Prime Minister's office in Tokyo, Japan, July 17, 2018.[Photo/Agencies]   The tariff-reducing deal signed by the European Union and Japan on Tuesday that marks a major trade liberalization step that will have a profound bearing on the global trade regime.  The free trade deal that will create a trade zone covering 600 million people and almost one-third of the global GDP shows that negotiations are more productive than threats in pushing forward trade.  By signing the agreement, Japan and the EU, have put the Donald Trump administration in an awkward situation as it is clear that as a result of its attempt to disrupt the normal global trade order the focus of global trade is switching to Eurasia.  Multinational law firm Baker Mackenzie said in a report released on Monday that China’s direct investment in European Union countries was nearly nine times more than in North America in the first half of the year and the value of completed Chinese investment was six times higher in Europe than in North America.  While China’s tighter regulation is behind the falling outbound investment in the US, the uncertainties caused by the rising protectionism sentiment in the US are undoubtedly an important factor of the investment divergence.  As time goes by, the effects the Trump administration’s coercion-based trade policies are having on the US economy will become increasingly apparent, as the world’s major economies implement reciprocal tariff policies and engage in closer cooperation with each other.  The Trump administration has claimed that it will obtain more benefits from its unilateral trade moves targeted at China and its other major trading partners. But as it is isolated from the global trade regime, the US will ultimately find the losses outweigh the gains.  In initiating trade actions to serve its domestic political needs, the Trump administration is taking a wrecking ball to the international trade rules that were put in place by the developed nations after World War II to avoid a chain reaction of higher tariffs.  If the US administration persists in trying to have everything its own way, then it will continue to face counteractions by others. Washington has set the events in motion with its unilateralism, protectionism and power politics, but, as it is discovering, the international community is united and determined to respond by upholding their legitimate rights and interests and maintaining the multilateral trading rules and system.  The Trump administration should put aside its belief that disputatiousness will be to its advantage.         "
Xi's trip to safeguard an open global economy: China Daily editorial,7/19/2018,"                      President Xi Jinping’s upcoming visits to the United Arab Emirates, Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius will enhance China’s bilateral ties with these Middle East and African countries, and his scheduled attendance at the 10th BRICS summit from July 25 to 27 in Johannesburg will send an unmistakable message to the outside world that China remains committed to deepening cooperation with emerging markets. At the BRICS summit, Xi is expected to elaborate on China’s expectations for the meeting, including strengthening the solidarity and cooperation of the bloc, grasping the opportunities of the new technological revolution and safeguarding multilateralism and improving the global governance system. As the world is grappling with the United States’ unilateralism and isolationism as well as a backlash against globalization, there are high expectations that BRICS will send a message of solidarity in opposing Washington’s attack on global trade and uphold more inclusive globalization. Solidarity among the members of BRICS, and their leaders’ unanimous endorsement of multilateralism and free trade will help boost confidence in the global economic recovery and reinforce the bloc’s role in promoting global growth. Over the years, BRICS, which groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has blazed new trails and stood out among other regional and global platforms for its dedication to forging reciprocal and win-win cooperation. It has become an important force in driving the wheels of the world economy and pushing forward reforms in global governance. With many Western countries facing a rising trend of populism and polarization in their societies, emerging markets are turning to China as an example of an alternative development model. China has repeatedly said it is willing to share its experience and perspectives on global development with other countries. It has contributed its ideas and wisdom to BRICS’s development, deeming it a crucial platform for the world to resist disruptions from trade protectionism and isolationism. Through its engagement with emerging and developing countries, China has breathed fresh air into international relations and initiated a new model of international cooperation in the spirit of mutual respect, win-win cooperation and common development. Last year, China successfully hosted the BRICS summit in Xiamen and helped chart the future for the second “golden decade” of BRICS cooperation. It is believed the Johannesburg summit, with the theme “BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution”, will continue the momentum of cooperation from the Xiamen summit.

Trump promotes deal by accepting no quick fix: China Daily editorial,7/18/2018,"                          US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to reporters at the Capitol about US President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, in Washington on Tuesday. James Lawler Duggan / reuters   It may go down in history as an insolvable riddle whether or not Donald Trump was, as he later argued, tripped by a double negative when he exonerated Russia, which allegedly meddled in his country’s 2016 general election that sent him to the White House, when he was expected to condemn it.Amid a furious backlash at home, even accusations of “treason”, the US president explained he had meant to say “wouldn’t” when he said “I don’t see any reason why it would” be Russia that interfered in the US election.President Trump believes in risk-taking, such as his meetings with foreign leaders less than popular in the American public, and then has cause to lament he is misunderstood. His meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un could have potentially defused two of the present-day world’s most damaging standoffs. For that reason alone, they were worth a try.While it remains unclear how far he can go in thawing the US-Russia relationship, he seems to already be bowing to reality and receding from his earlier boasts about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Despite insisting discussions with Pyongyang “are going very, very well”, Trump conceded on Tuesday there is “no time limit”, and “no speed limit” in place.Trump’s belated acknowledgment may appear embarrassing considering his and his team’s previous remarks that his meeting with Kim was a huge success and denuclearization would start “without delay”, and “very quickly”.But it is actually good for him to finally come to terms with the complexity of the matter and learn to appreciate the complexities while trying to resolve it. As time goes by, he will learn the “failures” he had seen on his predecessors’ parts may have more to do with the complicated nature of the issues than with the incompetence he has suggested. Pyongyang’s recent protest against “unilateral and gangster-like” US demands should have come as no surprise, because Washington has overestimated the Singapore summit’s productive potential. While the meeting materialized and culminated in an optimistically worded joint document, that in no way guarantees the immediate outcomes Trump has anticipated. The chances are denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be a considerably long process even if Washington does maintain sufficient, persistent patience and give due consideration to Pyongyang’s needs and requests. However, it is good to see Trump becoming realistic. He needs to be if he aspires to finally achieve what his predecessors couldn’t.         "

China Daily editorial: Has the meeting in Helsinki reset US-Russia relations?,7/17/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump receives a football from Russia's President Vladimir Putin during their joint news conference after a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, July 16, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It seems few share US President Donald Trump’s optimism that his summit on Monday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Helsinki helped dispel some of the tensions between the two countries.True, just as Trump said before the summit, the world wants to see him and Putin get along, since they are the leaders of the world’s two most heavily-armed nuclear powers and relations between the two countries continue to deteriorate.However, their longtime enmity, which can be traced back to the Cold War era, and their opposite positions on some critical international issues and their power wrestling in Syria and Crimea, indicate the contention between the two big countries will not vanish any time soon.Take Syria for example. The eight-year-old civil war, with the United States and Russia each backing opposite forces, seems drawing to an end with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, appearing to win.Considering that the US obviously does not want to see such a prospect to come true as it seeks regime change, Syria and the Middle East region at large will likely continue to be a venue for the tussle between the US and Russia.Back home, Trump’s meeting with Putin has divided opinion and it may fuel a fresh round of hostility among US politicians and media toward Russia and deepen the US suspicions of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US president election, a claim that Putin has dismissed as “utterly ridiculous”.Nonetheless, Trump’s remarks in his joint news conference with Putin, showing he trusts the words of the Russian leader as much as that of his own intelligence chief, have already aroused a strong backlash back home, drawing criticism even from members of his own camp. Yet with Trump saying there had been “deeply productive dialogue” on Monday and Putin describing the meeting as “candid and useful”, it is to be hoped the Helsinki summit represents a good beginning for better relations between the US and Russia, and that they will continue their high-level contacts and gradually mitigate their differences.The world needs real rapprochement between the two big nuclear powers.            "
Washington at odds with trends it cannot stop: China Daily editorial,7/17/2018,"                          Ginseng and pork were among the 128 US goods that China said will face new tariffs in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect last week. [Photo/VCG]   The International Monetary Fund warned on Monday that US tariff actions could lead to escalating and sustained trade conflicts that would derail the global economic recovery and dampen medium-term growth prospects.Its projections indicate that even though the effects may not surface in the short term, the harmful effects of the US-initiated tariff war against its major trade partners will become manifest in the coming years.It cautioned that, if carried out, the tariff threats of the United States and the consequent retaliation from its trade partners could reduce the global economic output projections for 2020 by half a percentage point.This is just the latest cry of alarm, and various calculations have shown that while its trade partners would be the victims of the US’ protectionist and unilateral trade moves, the US itself would also not be spared from the adverse effects of the trade confrontations it is initiating.In other words, the Donald Trump administration will not protect US workers and industries with its populist attack on trade. To do that, it should be promoting the healthy growth of the world economy. That means putting an end to its unilateral actions. But the Trump administration’s blind belief in might makes right was exposed by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer accusing US trade partners of not cooperating with Washington to find solutions to the US’ trade problems. He must have forgotten that China and the US initially conducted trade talks that produced a meaningful convergence, only for the US to then backpedal on the consensus that was reached.The IMF has suggested that to keep the world economy on track, global cooperation and a “rule-based trade system” should play their due roles. But that will be impossible if the US persists with its unilateral actions based on domestic laws. As Chinese Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen has said, there can be no meaningful talks if the US does not “take the gun off the head” of other countries.The current US administration is fixated on short-term gains and narrow-minded objectives, and it seems pathologically intent on ignoring the bigger picture of how the US, even though it is the world’s largest economy, is still one among many. The neocolonialist nature of the administration’s “America First” policy is the legacy of a mindset that should have already been consigned to the trash can of history. We all share the same home, one that in many ways is becoming increasingly smaller and flatter, the trend of countries becoming increasingly interdependent will not be reversed by the desire of some to sit above the salt as in olden days when to do so was to be the law.

[Photo/Xinhua]   Now that the US president has openly labeled the European Union “a foe” of his country, like he has Russia and China, it is difficult to predict how far he is willing to go in pursuit of his “America First” agenda. With the flames of trade friction spreading from the Americas to Asia and now to Europe, it is increasingly explicit that the US president does not mind upending the global trade order in his crusade for US preeminence. And this lends special significance to the consensus reached by Chinese and European Union leaders in Beijing on Monday that they will work together to preserve multilateralism and free trade. Having been engulfed by the last century’s two devastating world wars, European nations are justified in worrying that the trade confrontation initiated by the Donald Trump administration has the potential to mutate into violent “conflict and chaos”. “It is the common duty of Europe and China, but also America and Russia, not to destroy (the global trade order) but to improve it, not to start trade wars which have turned into hot conflicts so often in our history,” said European Council President Donald Tusk. He is right. The unilateral, protectionist, and hegemonic approach the White House has embraced will only acerbate trade ties, dismember the global market with tariff barriers, and sow the seeds of animosity that may grow into greater conflict. The ongoing tariffs tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington, for one, is increasingly seen as a harbinger of a broader standoff. That Beijing has moved spontaneously to balance trade ties, lower tariffs and offer broader market access amid the trade brawl with Washington carries the message that it is genuinely committed to an open, unified global market and freer, fairer trade. In the same spirit, it pledged on Monday to engage in open, transparent trade, to push for reform and improvement of the World Trade Organization, and to punish intellectual property rights violations.“Make violators with malicious motives lose their family fortune” was the harshest utterance ever made by Beijing in this regard. Better yet, Beijing announced that stemming intellectual property theft is essential to indigenous innovation. The China-EU Leaders’ Meeting was a fresh example of what difference a constructive approach can make. The escalating trade tensions with the two sides fomented by the US, on the other hand, highlight the destructive potential of going it alone.            "
Strong growth defies doomsayers’ expectations: China Daily editorial,7/16/2018,"                      Despite a slight slowdown in the second quarter, China’s growth has remained on track in the first half of this year, reaching an expectation-beating 6.8 percent year-on-year.China’s economic resilience is highlighted by the fact that growth has remained between 6.7 percent and 6.9 percent for 12 consecutive quarters.Considering it has been necessary for the authorities to take stringent regulatory measures and keep a prudent monetary policy stance to control financial risks, the 6.7 percent GDP growth in the second quarter is noteworthy.Admittedly, the growth rate is lower compared with the country’s historical highs, but those rates were of their times and were never going to be sustainable. Despite its relatively slower growth nowadays, China is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a major contributor to the global economy.The performance of sectors such as agriculture, services, emerging industries and retail, as well as people’s growing incomes and the falling unemployment rate in major cities support the assessment that China’s economic growth remains robust. And so far, at least, there are no apparent signs of any significant economic slowdown despite the potential impact of the China-US trade frictions.However, policymakers are likely to face more severe challenges in the second half of this year. The further contraction of liquidity, the possible easing of the property market, and the surfacing of the impact on the export side if the China-US trade frictions continue may combine to bring more growth challenges to policymakers.Therefore, the healthy GDP growth achieved in the first half of the year, which has been higher than the expectations of many China observers, should not mislead decision-makers.Judging by the comments of the National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Mao Shengyong on Monday, who observed that “external uncertainties are on the rise while the domestic economic restructuring is at a crucial stage”, the authorities are well aware of the challenges that lie ahead.To tackle those challenges, China needs to accelerate its supply-side structural reform to improve the capacity of the corporate sector to survive in the upcoming hard times. It also needs to help its exporters to divert their shipments to countries other than the United States, whose increases in tariffs targeted at Chinese goods are set to reduce its imports from China.Further progress in restructuring to improve economic quality and efficiency will help the country weather any headwinds it may encounter.           "
"China, EU must work  together for free trade: China Daily editorial",7/15/2018,"                      Contrary to US ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison’s claim prior to the meeting that “the overall theme” of the transatlantic organization’s latest summit in Brussels would be its ""strength and unity,” it was the opposite that was on display; it ended up showcasing discord.In the same manner he jolted other leaders at last month’s G7 meeting in Quebec, Canada, US President Donald Trump again demonstrated the disruptive potential of his “America First” approach to international relations.In the same manner he has been seeking to extort concessions from other allies and trading partners, including China, Trump threatened to erect trade barriers for European auto exports should the United States' NATO allies fail to satisfy his demand for an immediate, substantial increase in military spending. To his administration, all international arrangements inconsistent with US centrism are “unfair” and thus must be renegotiated, or simply discarded. When Chinese and European leaders meet on Monday in Beijing at the 20th China-EU Summit, they will share similar concerns and a common task — mitigate the shocks emanating from the White House, and in a broader sense, safeguard multilateralism and free trade.China and the European Union countries may differ, at some points conspicuously, on given issues. But a shared commitment to their nascent strategic partnership has established a reliable foundation for resolving those differences. More importantly, they have a common interest in safeguarding economic globalization and free trade. All disagreements notwithstanding, the EU and China are not in favor of confrontation with the US. But as the leaders convene to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and the 20th anniversary of the China-EU Summit, it is of particular significance they reaffirm commitment to the World Trade Organization and its rules.If the two sides can accomplish the anticipated exchange of market access request checklists at today’s meeting, it will be a substantial step toward accomplishing a bilateral investment treaty. And the benefits will ripple far beyond the bilateral realm.Although neither China nor the EU wants confrontation with the US, the unilateralism being pursued by the Trump administration threatens to do so much damage to the global trading regime and sow so much uncertainty that China and the EU must work together to limit the havoc being wrought by the Trump administration's neo-Firstism. For the perversity of that design is not that it puts the US' interests first, it is natural that a country's leaders should pursue their nation's interests, but in the way they are seeking to force others to submit and be subservient to that aim.

Payment demands may come at a price for US: China Daily editorial,7/12/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump holds a breakfast meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (L) at the NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium, July 11, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The meeting of 29 Western leaders at the NATO headquarters in Brussels that started on Wednesday has once again revealed the rift between the United States and its allies in Europe.  US President Donald Trump was as combative as expected on the opening day of the two-day meeting, tongue-lashing the other NATO members for not spending enough on their own defense and accusing Germany of being captive to Russian energy supplies.  Although who-pays-what has become a familiar feature of NATO summits in recent years, Trump has shaken the alliance to the core, by questioning why the US should pay to defend Europe when its European members are not willing to pay to defend it.  He has spent the two days haranguing the other leaders that their countries must pay their share of the bill and swiftly raise their contributions to 2 percent of their GDP.  But it is not so much the cost that is now worrying the US' European allies as the Trump administration's apparent ambivalence to the alliance itself.  Although Trump said on Thursday that the United States' commitment to NATO remains very strong, those words of support come after he reportedly said in the closed-door meeting with the other leaders on Thursday that they had to increase their support by January or the US would go its own way.  Trump may be right in his earlier assessment that the decades-old military bloc is ""obsolete"", as it was a product of the Cold War, but his seeming indifference to maintaining the alliance has merely reinforced the perception that the transatlantic unity that has been the foundation of the West-led order is no longer as strong as it was.  The broadening rift between the US and its European allies that has been revealed by his demands that they pay more for the US security umbrella could further widen after Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next Monday — which may well prove to be the most welcoming part of the European tour for him.  Trump's belligerent performance at the summit might have got him the results he wanted but it also showed his administration is not convinced that the global governance system, of which the US was a key architect, still serves the US' interests.  The forces of history that have gathered momentum over the past decade have revealed the relative decline of the West since its heyday after the collapse of the Soviet Union — whose presumed threat NATO was formed to deter — and the tendency of the Trump administration in response to this has been to throw the US' weight around to show that if it wants it can go it alone to get what it wants.  In doing so the administration is displaying the flaws in the Western-led institutions, which need to be more accommodating of the global trend to build a community with a shared destiny.         "
Proposed Pacific island summit a positive diplomatic move: China Daily editorial,7/11/2018,"                          The Papua New Guinea LNG project will bring significant benefits to the nation through sales revenue, taxes and royalties. Provided to China Daily   When Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O’Neill, during a visit to Fiji on Monday, mentioned China’s plan for a summit of Pacific island leaders later this year, it no doubt never entered his mind that it could spark such a firestorm in Australia and New Zealand.  In an address to Fiji’s parliament, O'Neill said that President Xi Jinping wishes to hold a meeting in Papua New Guinea ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that is to be held in Port Moresby from Nov 11 to Nov 18.  This caused consternation in Australia and New Zealand, with New Zealand’s acting prime minister Winston Peters issuing a warning about rising geopolitical tensions in the region as a result of Beijing’s attempt to fill what he said was a “vacuum” in the region.  Meanwhile, The Australian newspaper said the intended summit is “a display of confidence in China’s growing relationships in the region”, saying it “sends a message to Australia”.  But Australia and New Zealand should not over-interpret China’s plan for a summit with leaders from Pacific island countries which have diplomatic ties with China. Papua New Guinea as host to this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders’ Meeting, will naturally be a venue for multilateral diplomacy for participating countries.  Rather than hitting the panic button, the two biggest countries in Oceania should reflect on their own perceptions and policies, as set out in their respective defense papers, as these reveal how out of step they are with the times.  They should also reconsider their policies toward Pacific island countries. Viewing these smaller neighbors as their backyard, Canberra and Wellington have long been accused of providing insufficient support and assistance to these countries’ development.  If there is a political vacuum in the region, it is because Australia and New Zealand have for too long leaned on the United States, without making long-term commitment to improving the well-being and welfare of the island nations.  It is only recently when China has increased its loans and aid to Pacific island countries that Australia and New Zealand have started to pay more attention to the region.  China has no intention to fill whatever vacuum there is in the region or compete for influence.  Instead of bleating about China’s growing influence, Australia and New Zealand should join hands with China to usher in a better future for their smaller Pacific neighbors.         "
Growing opposition in US to its tariff attack: China Daily editorial,7/11/2018,"                          A customer shops at a store in Kansas City, Kansas, USA, on Nov 28, 2015. [Photo/IC]   The Donald Trump administration has further stoked the trade quarrel between China and the United States by announcing on Tuesday that it plans to levy 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  Although the new tariffs on goods such as agricultural and consumer goods will not come into effect for at least a couple of months, they send the signal the US does not intend to end its unfair trade policies any time soon.  China has not been surprised by the move, and it will take countermeasures as planned.  True, economists and industrial insiders have repeatedly said that China will fall prey to the ongoing Trump administration’s trade actions, but they have also emphasized that the hostilities will have a severe impact on US industries.  Signs of this are becoming increasingly apparent.  A number of US manufacturers have warned that they are being forced to move out of the US to avoid being adversely affected by the Trump administration’s tariff measures. There is a also a growing chorus of concern in the US about the rising prices that will result from the tariff increases.  The longer the China-US trade frictions go on, the more apparent these adverse effects will become and the more voices will be heard in the US opposing the Trump administration’s perverse trade moves.  Given China’s economic resilience, vast market and commitment to further opening-up, it is mission impossible for the Trump administration to achieve its objective of containing the county’s normal development through trade and investment restrictions.  As a sign of commitment to the China market, electric car producer Tesla announced to build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai on Tuesday, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China after the country announced it was abolishing the joint-venture requirement for the automobile industry in April. Eventually the Tesla factory in China will produce up to 500,000 vehicles annually.  Meanwhile, Rahm Emanuel, mayor of Chicago, is in China to attend a trade and investment forum and seek ways to strengthen economic ties between Chinese cities and Chicago.  The strong city-to-city links between the two countries also testify to the unreasonableness of the Trump administration’s tariff measures.  Aside from taking countermeasures, the best way for China to cope with the US assault on its trade is to stick to its established agenda of economic reform and opening-up to strengthen its own resilience and competitiveness.         "
China ready and able to counter US trade attack: China Daily editorial,7/10/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The timely release of supportive policies to strengthen the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of the country’s export-related enterprises and create a better investment environment shows that the Chinese authorities are expecting the maleficent actions of the United States to be both protracted and inexorable.  Two of the four measures announced by Ministry of Commerce on Monday are a direct response to mitigate the harm the US’ economic aggression will do to Chinese enterprises and individuals. The other two are aimed at promoting the quality of economic development and strengthening the resilience of the Chinese economy.  The Chinese authorities know well that the trade pressure the US is applying is putting the squeeze on some Chinese enterprises and individuals, but they have no choice except to stand and fight since the Donald Trump administration has demonstrated by going back on its word in recent months that it lacks any sincerity in seeking to reach a negotiated solution.  This is because — as has now become clear — that although the Trump administration has carried its complaints and accusations to great lengths, its ultimate goal is not the rebalancing of trade to reduce the US’ deficit with China or even greater access to the Chinese market, its fundamental objective is to hinder China’s development and curb the country’s capabilities for endogenous innovation.  It wants to rob China and the Chinese people of their future.  Thus, Beijing will not be able to appease Washington no matter how it manages its trade or economy. Even if China were to make concessions they will never be enough to put an end to the hostile actions of the US, since, as the world’s second-largest economy and a rising power, China will inevitably encounter a push back from the US, which wants to rope it in and keep it hobbled and corralled.  China has no option but to fight fire with fire. It has to resolutely fight back while taking proper measures to help minimize the cost to domestic enterprises and further open up its economy to global investors in accordance with the established direction and plans. In this way it will emerge stronger from the ordeal.  The Trump administration is acting based on wishes rather than sound provision of where its trade hostilities might lead. It is blindly betting on the hope that it will be able to suppress the vitality of the Chinese economy. Time will show the folly of this.         "
Cooperation with Arab states future-oriented: China Daily editorial,7/10/2018,"                                                 President Xi Jinping (C, front) poses for group photos with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (6th L, front) and heads of delegations to the eighth ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, July 10, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   In his speech delivered at the eighth ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum on Tuesday in Beijing, President Xi Jinping announced that China and Arab countries had agreed to establish a ""future-oriented strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development"". This has not only set the tone for China-Arab cooperation in the future but also opened a new chapter for ties between the two sides.  Since the commencement of the forum in 2004, it has become a major vehicle driving cooperation in a wide range of fields, including security.  Under the framework of the forum, the security cooperation between the two sides has continuously deepened, and it has reaped achievements in such areas as anti-terrorism, regional peacekeeping and judicial assistance. By establishing a strategic partnership, the two sides will be able to further boost the positive momentum for peace and stability in the region.  China has over the years actively supported international efforts to cope with crises and turmoil in the Middle East. It has actively participated in Iraq's post-war reconstruction, and pushed for political settlement of the conflict in Syria. But, as Xi said on Tuesday while pledging loans and financial aid to Arab states, development is key to resolving many of the problems in the Middle East.  This week's forum in Beijing will provide a clear road map for strengthening cooperation between China and the Arab states to promote development in the Middle East under the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.  Over the past few years, the friendship that was forged long ago by means of the ancient Silk Road trade routes has flourished and exchanges and contact between the two sides have maintained a robust momentum on both the governmental and people-to-people levels. This has laid a solid foundation for the two sides to become close cooperative partners under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, which many Arab countries have already enthusiastically aligned their development plans with.  Thanks to their embracing of the spirit of pragmatism, the cooperation between China and Arab states has already proved fruitful. And they are making constant efforts to build a community with shared interests and shared future through closer collaboration and coordination.         "
Weapon of the law effective in battle against pollution: China Daily editorial,7/9/2018,"                                                 A file photo shows air polllution in Beijing. [Photo/VCG]   That the country's top legislature convened a special meeting on Monday and Tuesday to discuss a report on the results of its inspections to determine how effectively the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law is being implemented, and a draft decision on further ways to strengthen protection of the environment in accordance with the law, speaks volumes about the importance the country's top authorities attach to the issue.  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress sent four teams to eight provincial-level regions — the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces — from May to June to check how effectively the law to curb air pollution is being implemented.  The teams spoke with local governments and relevant departments, and conducted on-the-spot inspections of 107 enterprises. Local people's congresses were entrusted with similar inspections in 23 provincial-level regions.  The results of the inspections are encouraging as they found that overall the situation is improving, with the most recent amendments to the law emphasizing more decentralized emissions governance and mechanisms for controlling the sources of air pollution, producing a marked reduction in air pollution nationwide, with the average concentrations of both PM10 and PM2.5 declining significantly from the levels in 2013.  The amendments to the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law that became effective on Jan 1, 2016, have established a legal foundation for improving air quality by transferring the responsibility for regulating air pollutants to local governments, which have to tackle pollution at source by forcing enterprises that fail to meet the nation's environmental protection standards to rectify the problems or else shut down.  In 2017 alone, there were nearly 40,000 cases involving environmental pollution, and 30 percent of them involved air pollution, showing the law is an effective weapon in the intensifying fight against pollution.  The inspections by the NPC aim to ensure that the weapon of the law is being wielded and used to carry out the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, which has identified preventing and controlling pollution as one of three ""tough battles"" the country must win, along with forestalling major risks and carrying out targeted poverty alleviation.  In this way, the NPC is exerting more pressure on localities to wage war against polluters, and playing its role in guaranteeing people will be able to enjoy a green homeland and blue skies.

Combined defense against Trump's trade attack needed: China Daily editorial,7/9/2018,"                                                 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrives in Berlin, capital of Germany, July 8, 2018, for the fifth round of China-Germany intergovernmental consultations and an official visit to the European country. [Photo/Xinhua]   Premier Li Keqiang's three-day visit to Germany, which started on Sunday, comes against the backdrop of rising protectionism and unilateralism, as US President Donald Trump's go-it-alone policies have put the rule-based global trade system at risk.  That both China and Germany support free trade and advocate economic globalization should make them natural allies against the Trump administration's protectionist tendencies. And as the economic locomotives of Asia and Europe, respectively, China and Germany are duty bound to safeguard a fair and just international order.  To achieve that, Beijing and Berlin have to explore ways to tap their cooperation potential to offset any damage that may rise from the trade bullying of the United States and coordinate comprehensive cooperation for the future.  That their economies are highly complementary bodes well for win-win outcomes. For example, German car manufacturers, which have already taken up nearly 20 percent of the Chinese market, will continue to see their sales expand in the country as China lowers tariffs in a new round of market openings. While the technological edge that German companies enjoy will make them big beneficiaries of the ""innovation cooperation"" that President Xi Jinping urged during Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China in May.  However, one of the major hurdles in the way of smoother bilateral economic and trade ties and greater cooperation and coordination is that some in Germany have seen Chinese investment and takeovers in the country as acts of ""industrial espionage"" and tried to block them. This has led to Chinese enterprises falling far behind their German counterparts in terms of the scale and quality of their mutual investment. It is hoped that Li's pledge that China will respect intellectual property rights and protect commercial secrets will help dispel that suspicion.  And despite this hurdle, China-Germany cooperation has never been stronger. China is Germany's largest trading partner and Germany has remained China's largest trading partner in Europe for over four decades. The high rate of exchange of visits by top leaders — this is Li's fourth visit to Germany, and Merkel has visited China 11 times — underlines an exemplary relationship that is built on broad common interests and shared aspirations. Apart from trade, the two countries see eye to eye on issues ranging from the Iran nuclear deal to the climate change agreement.  That enables Beijing and Berlin to join hands and stand up together for a multilateral global system that is being challenged by Trump's ""America first"" strategy.         "
Trust building is still needed for peninsula denuclearization,7/8/2018,"                                                 There should be no turning back the historic momentum on the peninsula as it conforms to the common aspirations of the international community for denuclearization and peace. [Photo/VCG]   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wound up a three-day visit to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on the weekend. The first high-level contact between the United States and the DPRK in the wake of the historic meeting between their two leaders signals the two sides’ continuing efforts to resolve their differences and promote the denuclearization process.  Since US President Donald Trump and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un’s summit in Singapore on June 12, there have been high expectations worldwide that the Korean Peninsula issues will be resolved once and for all. However, given the complexity of the situation, there is still a long way to go before that wish can be realized.  That Washington and Pyongyang have aired different views on the outcome of Pompeo’s visit is clear proof that the two sides still need more consultations and clarifications so that they, along with other stakeholders in the issue, can dispel mistrust and design a roadmap leading for peace and denuclearization on the peninsula.  Although Pompeo described the high-level negotiations as “productive” and insisted progress was made, the DPRK called the high-level talks “regrettable” and slammed the US demands as reflecting a “gangster-like mindset” in a statement. Fortunately, Pyongyang said it still trusts Trump, which is significant for sustaining the current good momentum.  During the Trump-Kim meeting, Washington and Pyongyang reached important agreements on principle issues. But it would be naïve to think the enmity and distrust built up over decades would simply disappear overnight.  While hammering out the details of a roadmap for denuclearization and peace, it is essential that the two sides continue high-level consultations and build greater mutual trust so that they heed each other’s major concerns. It may be, as suggested, the two countries have different understandings of denuclearization. If this is the case, it proves the necessity of continuous engagement and trust building. That the two sides have reportedly agreed to form working groups to oversee their interactions will hopefully be conducive to this.  Meanwhile, major stakeholders in the peninsula issue also need extensive communication so as to build a broader consensus among them. After all, there should be no turning back the historic momentum on the peninsula as it conforms to the common aspirations of the international community for denuclearization and peace.         "
Further opening up remains the way forward for China,7/8/2018,"                                                 While coping with the US’ economic attack, China must continue to reform and open its economy to the world to make it stronger and better integrate it into the global economic system. [Photo/VCG]   With the United States having already activated 25 percent tariffs on some $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, the Washington-initiated trade dispute with China has escalated and could worsen.  China must be ready for a protracted trade war with the US given the real aim of Washington is to contain China’s development.  Since the end of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, the wealth gap in the US has continually widened thanks to the country’s low interest rate policy, which has led to rapidly rising asset prices that benefit the wealthy while putting the poor at a disadvantage. The US authorities are using China as a scapegoat for this.  The wealth gap, predictably, will not ease significantly within a short timeframe and the Donald Trump administration is expected to continue to find various excuses to shift the anxiety and anger of US voters onto China.  Historically, while it has also frequently cooperated with China to consolidate its global leadership, the US has never given up its desire to contain it.  Therefore, Beijing should throw away any expectations it may have that the US will stop using its economic supremacy to prevent China from further development even if it toes the US line. What the US wants is not only concessions in the field of trade, but depriving China of its right to development.  While coping with the US’ economic attack, China must continue to reform and open its economy to the world to make it stronger and better integrate it into the global economic system.  It must accelerate its economic restructuring and further carry out its supply-side structural reforms to make its growth more efficient and resilient.  And it must further economic cooperation with other countries by improving the business environment for domestic and foreign companies and opening up its economy wider to the outside world. In the era of economic globalization, closing the door would only lead to the loss of economic vitality.  Further opening up of the Chinese economy is especially significant at a time when the world economy is in need of fresh impetus to make its recovery more sustainable. As a responsible major player, China should not let the trade frictions with the US block its preset agenda of further reform and opening-up policies.  The global economy has come to a critical point as it is facing the stern challenge of US-led unilateralism. China must join hands with other countries to safeguard the multilateral economic system and contribute to sustainable growth of the world economy.         "
Trade bullying of US administration will cause damage to global economy: China Daily editorial,7/7/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China escalated on Friday when the US imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion, immediately triggering reciprocal tax measures by China on goods worth the same amount imported from the US.  The tariff exchange has all that it takes to be called a full-blown trade war that would only intensify if the two sides’ trade hostilities were aggravated by further tit-for-tat tariff measures. Which may occur sooner rather than later given the US president has promised further action should China retaliate to the US’ latest tariffs.  Yet despite Trump’s confident assertion that a trade war will be easy to win, it is only him and his ideological cartel that believe that would be the case.  There are rising and widespread concerns, not least in the US, that the escalating feud is jeopardizing the US’ economic upswing and that if the situation worsens — with the two sides augmenting their tit-for-tat tariff measures with quid pro quo restrictions on each other’s investment activities — that would severely dampen business confidence and hit the financial markets.  And it is not just China’s trade the Trump administration wants to maul, it is also clawing away at the US’ other major trade partners. In terms of its global impact, the Trump administration’s trade predation will only serve to disrupt international supply chains and value chains, battering the global economy, and victimizing enterprises and consumers around the world, including the US.  Trump and his cabal of like-minded “firsters” might believe that the US will emerge from the economic carnage they seem intent on causing as the only winner, but one only has to look back over the past 10 years to see the folly of this conjecture.  The global economy has been on life support for most of the past decade, and it has only recently shown signs that it is on the mend.  In that process, close cooperation and coordination among the major economies has been vital. If the Trump administration persists with its plundering, it will undo all the good work that has been done.  Yet economic appeasement will only embolden the Trump administration and encourage its all-for-me approach.  The rest of the world should stand firm and shake some sense into it.  Trump and his coterie should see reason and take a step back from the brink.         "

          Iran deal has proved its worth despite US claiming otherwise: China Daily editorial
        ",7/5/2018,"                           US President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement after signing it in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, US, May 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   In contrast to the hardening US position against Iran, the other parties to the Iranian nuclear deal are stepping up their communication in a bid to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made what was described as a visit of ""prime importance"" to Europe from Monday to Wednesday to gain a more precise picture of cooperation between Iran and Europe ahead of the meeting for the top diplomats from the signatory countries, except of course the United States, convened by Federica Mogherini, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy.  The Vienna meeting will be the first between the other parties to the deal since the US withdrawal and such intensive diplomacy is essential if the deal is not to fall apart. And it is worth upholding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the deal, as it marks a significant breakthrough in multinational efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Despite US President Donald Trump claiming it was a ""bad deal"", it established a transparent and stringent process for inspecting Iran's nuclear activities that has proved effective and which has shown it has fully complied with the restrictions imposed on it.  When Trump announced he was withdrawing the US from the multilateral agreement, his administration set 90-day and 180-day wind down periods before it would fully revive its sanctions regime against Teheran. Considering that there is only one month left before the first deadline, it is hoped the other signatory countries will send a signal of solidarity during the Vienna meeting.  If the US reimposes sanctions on Teheran and makes good on its threat of long-arm punishment of those conducting normal business with the Middle East country, the US will not only further disrupt the workings of international trade but also undermine the norms governing nation-to-nation ties.  A signatory state to the Iran deal, China opposes the US' unilateralism. It rightly regards the Iran deal as an important achievement of multilateralism and remains a staunch supporter of it.  Much has changed in the world arena since the deal took effect three years ago. But the deal's role in preventing further chaos in the Middle East and upholding the international nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime should not be underestimated.  This is especially true when good momentum on resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula has emerged of late. Retrogression in the Iranian nuclear issue will not bode well for attempts to finally secure a breakthrough in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear issue.         "
US will feel the blowback from its trade extortion: China Daily editorial,7/5/2018,"                          Staff at a fruit company in the US arrange apples for export to China via e-commerce platforms. [Photo/Xinhua]   Although the World Trade Organization did not name any particular country, its warning that trade barriers are damaging the global economy and that the effects are already apparent should be heeded by the United States.  While the objective of the Donald Trump administration's protectionism is to reverse the relative economic decline of the US and benefit selected domestic industries and workers in the US, it will not achieve those aims. Instead, the effect will be rising prices in the US, which in turn will affect the balance sheets of many US companies operating in China, since they account for a large proportion of China's exports to the US.  In effect, the Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China, and its unruliness looks set to have a profoundly damaging impact on the global economic landscape in the coming decades, unless countries stand together to oppose it.  China, which is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's racketeering gun sights, has no choice but to fight back. While it has endeavored to avoid confrontation by engaging in sincere dialogue with the US in recent months, that earnestness has not been reciprocated. And there should be no doubting Beijing's resolve, it will not give in to blackmail and will not falter from its staunch defense of free trade and the multilateral trading system.  The road for China to grow into this role as a key part of the global economic system in the past decades has not been smooth. But it has shown its resilience before and it is capable of coping with the current US-initiated trade challenge this time; indeed it will emerge stronger from the test.  A predecessor of Trump once professed that he had one yardstick by which he tested every major problem: Is it good for the US?  The Trump administration may hope to keep ""America first"" with its attempts at extorting concessions in its favor, but its pursuit of economic hegemony is unlikely to prove good for the US.  The trade actions initiated by the Trump administration will not only harm China's economy, but also that of the US — not only as a result of reciprocal actions by China but also because of the damage done to the international supply chains by the US trade blows, since these also support the US economy.  While tariffs can be swiftly rolled back, Washington would do well to bear in mind these links will be harder to fix.         "
"No reason for arrogance, but China can be confident: China Daily editorial",7/4/2018,"                      While it is true that China has made remarkable achievements in many areas since the launch of reform and opening-up 40 years ago, from the surfeit of online and social media stories with sensational headlines bragging about how strong or powerful the country is in seemingly every respect, one would be forgiven for thinking that the country was the world's only superpower. Yet what is noteworthy is the fact that most of those who have written these stories have no understanding or just a smattering of knowledge about what they write about. They give their stories sensational click-bait headlines in order to catch readers' attention and thus get more viewers, which can then be monetarized. It is this that propels some to go to extremes with their claims. Since the majority of those who read such posts rarely bother to delve any deeper into what they've read, there is a tendency for them to get carried away by the supposed standing of this nation in the world, believing it can assert itself wherever and whenever it pleases. And this has the additional appeal of enabling belief in redress for the past humiliations the country suffered. Yet what people should bear in mind, the nation's elite in particular, is that it is the modesty and earnestness Chinese people have displayed in learning from other countries, the developed ones in particular, which has made it possible for China to become what it is today. For an individual, the motto should be one is never too old to learn. And for a nation, it can never be too strong to learn. For China, which is not as strong as some would believe, there are still a lot of challenges ahead and there is still much it can learn from developed countries. There is no reason for China and its people to be arrogant and haughty no matter how strong and prosperous the country becomes. And no reason for China to lord it over other countries. China's worldview is shaped by its understanding of the underlying historical trends and its focus on the big picture, and for this reason it wants the international community to come together in recognition of its shared future, Thus, even as China's economic strength continues to grow, earnestness in getting along well with the rest of the world will continue to be the principle on which China's diplomacy is based.

Joint defense against Trump's trade assault: China Daily editorial,7/4/2018,"                          ZHAI HAIJUN/FOR CHINA DAILY   While it is true that China and Europe do not always see eye to eye with each other, one thing they agree on is that the protectionism of the Trump administration should be opposed.  This solidarity will undoubtedly be to the fore during Premier Li Keqiang's six-day visit to Bulgaria and Germany that starts on Thursday, during which he will attend the seventh Leaders' Meeting between China and Central and Eastern European Countries to be held in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital.  As US President Donald Trump is threatening billions of dollars in tariffs on steel, aluminum and cars imported from Europe, escalating worries over a full-blown global trade war, China, which is also a victim of the Trump administration's protectionism, is reaching out to the continent with a clear message they should work together to uphold free trade and economic globalization.  China and Europe are in the same trench in the fight against the unilateralism and protectionism of the United States, which the European Union has called ""totally unacceptable"" and China sees as an act of ""blackmail"".  There have been reports that the EU and China have agreed to launch a working group to promote reform at the World Trade Organization in a bid to ward off the damage that the unilateral actions of the US may do to the multilateral trade system. And the upcoming talks between Li and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has repeatedly criticized Trump for his protectionist policies, will help China and Germany coordinate their stances should this be the case.  And there is ample room for China and the EU as a whole to strengthen their cooperation, not only by boosting their economic ties, but also in fighting anti-globalization. It is the US that will lose more if China turns to Europe and buys more Airbus jets and farm produce, and looks to increase its investments in the EU, rather than the US.  Chinese companies have already invested heavily in the Central and Eastern European countries, building ports, airports and high-speed railways, and China's trade with the 16 countries reached $68 billion last year, a year-on-year increase of 15.9 percent, while its trade with Germany hit $168 billion, up by 11 percent year-on-year.  Li's visit will provide an opportunity for China and Europe to join hands as defenders of free trade in the face of US' protectionism and demonstrate that the taunts and threats of the Trump administration are only uniting countries in opposition to his unilateralism, which promises to yield little advantage for the US.

US economic hegemony bodes ill for the world: China Daily editorial,7/3/2018,"                          An American flag flies outside the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks are off to a mostly lower start on Wall Street on May 31, 2018. [Photo/IC]   The Trump administration, in its latest attempt to block Chinese entry into the US market amid its ongoing trade dispute with China, is recommending that the application by China Mobile to provide telecom services in the United States be denied.  Unsurprisingly, the administration has cited national security concerns to back its decision — the same concerns the administration cites when denying the acquisition of US technology-related companies by Chinese enterprises.  As the world’s most powerful economy, the US plays a vital role in global economic and trade rule-setting and it is always able to find seemingly plausible reasons for its initiative targeting China. When it comes to trade, for instance, it claims that China adopts “unfair” trade practices that have caused the huge bilateral trade gap, ignoring the fact that the US’ trade deficit is a result of the changing global division of labor over the past decades and the low savings rate in the US.  Transit trade, which refers to goods shipped from other countries to the US via China, which is calculated by the US as imports from China, also accounts for the trade deficit figures the Trump administration cites, something it refuses to acknowledge.  Another example of unfounded finger-pointing by the US is the Made-in-China 2025 initiative. The US has claimed that China uses public funds to support its industrial development, which puts US companies at a disadvantage, paying no heed to the fact that China’s use of policy and industrial funds to accelerate industrial expansion is a common practice across the world.  Therefore, to many, the trade war the US sees intent on initiating is the country’s strategy to keep China on the back foot so that it will not develop as fast as it otherwise would, and thus unable to challenge the dominant role of the US in the global economic order.  The US has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony.  It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the US dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries. Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China’s normal development.  This hegemonic mentality is dangerous for the world economy, which requires close cooperation and normal competition, not a damaging trade war, to achieve sustainable growth. Although it may temporarily bring some benefits to selected US industries and workers, it will ultimately make the US lose creditability in the international community and bring destructive uncertainties to international investors that eye the US market.

Dictatorial bent of US is the real global threat: China Daily editorial,7/2/2018,"                      With US President Donald Trump announcing the United States withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal last month and now ratcheting up the pressure on Teheran, confidence that the multilateral deal can survive has been fading day by day.  However, although Iran is making preparations to revive its nuclear program should the deal fall apart, the visit to Europe this week by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has raised a glimmer of hope that the nuclear nonproliferation deal will hold, as he has indicated Teheran’s willingness to reach an agreement with the European Union that with the support of China and Russia will keep the deal alive.  However, in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Trump piled pressure on European countries by threatening to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.  It is a threat of extraterritorial sanctions to block trade and financial activities by non-US parties that he has extended to other countries doing business with Iran — something that the international community should resolutely oppose as it breaches the sovereignty of other states.  China, for instance, maintains normal economic exchanges and trade with Iran that are conducted on the basis of conforming to its obligations as a signatory to the Iran nuclear deal and under international law.  The US has no right to impose its will on China and others and to try and coerce them to stop their legal trading with Iran. Countries that still believe in multilateralism should work together and push back against the unilateralism of the Trump administration so that the international norms of behavior remain intact and the US is not able to dictate who trades with whom depending on its own interests.  Meanwhile, the Iranian nuclear nonproliferation deal is at a crossroad, for if the EU and other economies yield to the coercion of the US it will spell the end of the deal. As long as Iran and the EU do not retrogress in their commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, there is still hope that the Iran nuclear deal will be able to survive without the US.  The deal is an important achievement of multilateralism, one that has proved effective since it was agreed. Safeguarding the deal will not only be conducive to preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and preventing further chaos in the Middle East, it will also continue to uphold it as an example that hot issues can be resolved through diplomacy.

Trump using cudgel against world trade: China Daily editorial,7/2/2018,"                      Even though Washington helped design the World Trade Organization and the trade body usually rules in favor of the United States when Washington brings cases before it, US President Donald Trump seems intent not only on criticizing the WTO but on sidelining it completely. Reports reveal he has been considering the draft of a bill for the US to abandon key WTO principles so he can ""have more say"" over US trade policy. A White House official confirmed to CNN that Trump ordered the draft legislation and was briefed on it in May, even though those who drew up the proposal believe it to be ""unworkable"". The leaked proposal, referred to as the United States Fair and Reciprocal Tariff Act, would give Trump the authority to act based on his administration's assessment of trading policies between nations. This would mean the US president would be acting of his own volition instead of adhering to the collective rules of the WTO and the US' obligations as a member. Although it is thought that if put forward, the proposal would face opposition in Congress, even that is not certain given the extent to which the restraints on the presidency have been softened. Trump has already caused a crisis in the WTO by blocking the appointment of new trade judges, which has threatened to destroy the dispute settlement system. But quitting the WTO, as he will no doubt have been advised, would not be in the interests of the US, no matter how much anathema Trump has for the trade body. Although his administration claims to welcome economic relationships rooted in fairness, reciprocity, and faithful adherence to the rules, it belies that by acting unfairly and breaking the rules so it can take as much as it can without giving anything back. Yet even by resorting to economic brutality his administration will not be able to extort prosperity from others. The US' prosperity and security are being challenged by its lack of competitiveness in many sectors, not because it has to play by the same rules as its trade partners. The world is undergoing a profound adjustment, and while some sectors in the US will feel the pain of change, history shows international trade boosts countries' economic growth over the long-term, and there is no reason why the US should prove an exception. By running roughshod over the WTO rules with its attempt at an economic shakedown, the US is shooting itself in the foot, as it has triggered retaliation from all its major trade partners.

Trump's protectionism puts US economy in danger: China Daily editorial,7/1/2018,"                          Trump's protectionism puts US economy in danger. [Photo/VCG]   Demonstrating they can stand together when the need arises, Asian countries united on the weekend in opposition to the United States' unilateral trade actions and their ""debilitating implications for the multilateral trading system"".  At a meeting of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, co-chaired by Japan and Singapore, trade ministers and officials from 16 countries renewed their commitment to the regional free trade pact and pledged to accelerate negotiations on the outstanding issues in order to reach a basic agreement in time for their meeting in Singapore at the end of the year.  Five years have passed since the idea of the RCEP was first raised in 2012, but negotiations among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian nations, Australia, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand, have proved challenging. Divergences over tariffs, trade in services and investment rules, and intellectual property rights protection, as well as concerns about China's influence, have previously proved a drag on reaching an agreement.  However, the actions of the Trump administration have spurred efforts for the countries to bridge their economic and political differences so they can come together for the common good, and it now seems that the RCEP will finally materialize to make the region a flagship for free and fair trade.  And in a separate development on the weekend, the tariff-cut amendment of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement became effective Sunday, with China's Ministry of Commerce saying it would facilitate regional economic integration in Asia and provide new economic impetus for the APTA members. According to the adjustment, the six APTA members — Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, the Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka — have cut tariffs by an average of 33 percent on products under 10,312 tariff codes, with some products from less-developed Bangladesh and Laos enjoying special reductions of 86 percent.  These developments show countries in the region are dedicated to upholding free and fair trade, which although it is something US President Donald Trump often claims to be doing, is clearly not the case since his administration's actions belie his words.  Indeed, not only have those actions put the US at odds with countries in Asia, where it has been keen to make itself at home, but they are increasingly alienating the US from the global trading system that it established – and tilted in its favor.  It seems that Trump in seeking the humiliation and weakening of the US' trade competitors, is willing to not only see the US dishonored but also its own economy injured.         "
"'One country, two systems' proves a winner for HK: China Daily editorial",7/1/2018,"                          100 drones hovered to celebrate the 21st anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the establishment of the HKSAR, July 1, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Sunday was the 21st anniversary of the day China resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  Despite rampant pessimism about Hong Kong's future under China's rule in the days leading up to July 1, 1997, the special administrative region has thrived since then, thanks to the institutional arrangement of ""one country, two systems"".  This innovative policy not only ensured the smooth return of Hong Kong to China, but 21 years of practice have shown that it has been the effective guarantee for Hong Kong's continued development and stability.  The policy was the brainchild of Deng Xiaoping, who is also regarded as the ""designer-in-chief"" of China's reform and opening-up, which in propelling the mainland's remarkable development over the past 40 years, has provided the foundation for the successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy in Hong Kong.  Thus the recent pledges by President Xi Jinping of more reform and further opening-up promise bright prospects for Hong Kong's future. Especially since it will be able to give full play to its advantages as the plan for coordinated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is advanced.  Hong Kong was not spared the consequences and challenges of the global financial crisis, and like other countries it witnessed the outpouring of frustrations from those who felt the effects the most — sentiments that were exploited by those with an agenda of their own other than the well-being of Hong Kong and its residents.  However, the lawful settlement of these once again demonstrated the resilience and vitality of the ""one country, two systems"" policy.  New problems are inevitable going forward, but, as the past 21 years have proved, with the support of the central government and the vitality of the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, Hong Kong will be able to overcome them and make its contribution to the Chinese dream.  Under the leadership of the CPC, led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, the nation has never been more confident about its future, and by continuing to implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and handing affairs strictly in line with the country's Constitution and Hong Kong's Basic Law, the special administrative region can look forward to continued prosperity and stability.

China staunch defender of free trade under WTO: China Daily editorial,6/28/2018,"                          Photo taken on April 12, 2018 shows the World Trade Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. [Photo/Xinhua]   There can be no order without rules. And trade is no exception to this. The World Trade Organization regulates the trade between nations to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.  China has spared no efforts in honoring the promises it made to join the WTO, and the country has not only abided by the WTO rules over the past 17 years. It has contributed a great deal to the development of the world economy and is a staunch defender of the WTO trade system.  In contrast, the Donald Trump administration's unilateralism and trade protectionism pose an ever greater threat to free trade. Under the unjustifiable pretext of national security, it has violated the United States' WTO obligations by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and discriminating among its WTO trade partners.  There is no denying that China has benefited a lot as a member of the WTO, which has facilitated its opening-up and reform. Without integrating its economy with that of the world, it would have been impossible for the country to maintain its double-digit economic growth for more than a decade.  Yet the other side of the coin is that as a rule-abiding member of the WTO, China has also contributed to the world economy. Had it not been for China's help and support, it would not have been possible for the US and other major Western countries to have emerged from the devastating effects of the 2008 financial crisis so quickly.  And without China's opening-up, it would not have been possible for so many transnational corporations to benefit from their business in China. And of course, those businesses have provided jobs for China and enabled the country to earn more from international trade.  Free trade is undoubtedly reciprocal. China is a beneficiary of free trade within the framework of the WTO, but it also benefits others. It is a contributor to the development of the world economy and defender of the current world economic order.  Because they fail to appreciate this, some Western countries regard China as simply a free rider on globalization and refuse to recognize China's status as a market economy as they should.  That the US refuses to settle its trade dispute with China within the framework of the WTO only points to its own lack of respect for the WTO trade rules.  China will continue to abide by WTO rules and firmly defend the current world economic order, as it believes that rules-based multilateralism is essential for the healthy development of the world economy.

Chinese investors react to global uncertainties: China Daily editorial,6/28/2018,"                      Stock markets around the world fell on Wednesday after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business Network that the Donald Trump administration had not softened its stance on China. Added to the ongoing concerns about disruption to global supply chains resulting from the US administration's attack on China's plan to upgrade its manufacturing, along with expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, it is natural that nervous investors are seeking safer places to put their money. Chinese investors have proved to be no exception and the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.93 percent and the Shenzhen Component Index down 1.06 percent at close of business on Thursday. And Chinese equities are now down 20 percent on the year's high in January. To be fair, the jitters of Chinese investors are aggravated by the government's ongoing efforts to deleverage and tackle financial risks, as well as the macro data for May, which suggest industrial output, investment and retail sales all grew slower than expected. However, the current sentiment reflected in China's falling stock market reflects an emotional response to the short-term uncertainties rather than a rational appreciation of the country's long-term prospects. As central bank governor Yi Gang noted last week, China has good economic fundamentals, resilient economic growth and balanced supply and demand. Even a full-blown trade war between China and the United States is expected to cut only 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points off China’s economic growth, dependent on the scale of tariffs on Chinese exports. And given that officials from the two countries are still actively discussing ways to avoid this worst-case scenario, there is no reason to think the fallout from the two sides’ trade quarrel cannot be managed. However, while their dispute in all likelihood will end with a relative whimper rather than a bang, there is no indication of when that might arrive. Until the dust settles and the global economy stabilizes, investors will continue to find their nerve being tested.         "
Legislation shows Canberra's pursuit of political capital: China Daily editorial,6/27/2018,"                      It is normal for every nation to want to do everything it can to ensure that its politics are free of any foreign interference and to deter espionage. And under normal circumstances, Australian legislation aimed at preventing political interference by foreign governments, making lobbying transparent and criminalizing espionage, would have nothing to do with China. Unfortunately and without any justification, since the day it was first proposed, Canberra has pointed to Beijing as the rationale for the new legislation. Although the legislature has not mentioned China, the new legislation is the outcome of months of China-bashing frenzy whipped up by Australian media and fueled by members of the government, despite Beijing repeatedly denying the accusations leveled against it. Given the anti-China sentiment that has been allowed to fester, by associating the legislation with China, the Australian government has sought to boost its own popularity by exploiting the outdated bias and paranoia harbored by some Australians. Yet the anti-China hysteria it has cynically allowed to build up, does not reflect the concerns of the majority of Australians. A recent survey conducted by the Lowy Institute shows Australians' concerns about China's growing power ranked below such issues as the actions of US President Donald Trump and the influx of immigrants and refugees. Indeed, according to a June 20 Sydney Morning Herald article, Australian surveys in recent years have found the vast majority of Australians — 82 percent — see China as ""more of an economic partner"" than a military threat. Certainly, Australian farmers and ranchers are fearful they will be adversely affected by the ongoing skirmishes between the two sides. However, the Malcolm Turnbull government seems to find comfort in the familiarity of the past rather than embracing the possibilities of the present. Turnbull has previously labeled China a ""frenemy"", and that split perspective means his administration keeps flip-flopping between being conciliatory and confrontational toward China, trying to seize the opportunities of China's rise while becoming fearful each time it strays too far from the United States' China policy. His administration should find a way to better balance its relations with the two countries. Viewing China rationally and with respect would be a start.         "
"US must respect China's core interests, treasure ties: China Daily editorial",6/27/2018,"                      US Defense Secretary James Mattis, who has previously been critical of China, accusing the country of ""intimidation and coercion"" in the region and claiming it is ""out of step with international law"" with its ""militarizing"" of islands in the South China Sea, struck a more positive tone during his talks in Beijing on Wednesday. Given the depths of suspicion and misunderstanding revealed in his earlier remarks, and the inclination of US President Donald Trump to unleash a torrent of similar remarks whenever it suits him, Mattis' promise ahead of his visit to do ""a lot of listening"" was both refreshing and welcome. Although it would be unrealistic to expect that even by lending an ear to China's words the differences between the two sides can be resolved by his two-day visit. But the fact that the two militaries are willing to maintain open and honest dialogue speaks of the resilience and maturity of the two countries' military-to-military relations, which are critical to the broader Sino-US relationship and to control risks. And it is encouraging that the two defense departments are working hard to ease tension and promote mutual trust, as Wei Fenghe, Chinese state councilor and minister of national defense, said on Wednesday. Especially at the moment, when the differences between Beijing and Washington have become more evident because of their trade quarrel and the Trump administration's impetuous use of Taiwan as a pawn in its game. Both sides know that good bilateral military communication is an important stabilizing factor for relations between the two countries, and will help avoid miscalculation and confrontation. During his talks with Mattis on Wednesday, President Xi Jinping expressed confidence in the two sides being able to properly manage their divergences, saying the China-US relationship, ""one of the most important"" in the world, must be treasured. And he clarified that China will no longer let the historical sovereignty issues slide; it will not give up an inch of the territory of its ancestors. But it does not want anything that belongs to others. However, while the Pacific is big enough for both countries, as Xi again pointed out, it takes two to tango. For Sino-US relations to improve, Washington must respond with good faith. Mattis struck the right note when he responded to Xi's show of goodwill by saying ""we are assigning the same high degree of importance to the military-to-military relationship, as you just noted"". But this perspective is not the general approach the US has taken to relations under the presidency of Donald Trump, and for the two countries to continue to build on their common ground the US must also treasure the relationship and match such words with actions. History shows that it serves both countries' interests if they can effectively manage their differences and respect each other’s core interests.         "
Progress and challenges in the fight against drugs: China Daily editorial,6/26/2018,"                      As China marked International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on Tuesday by burning seized drugs and announcing the executions of some drug traffickers, there is no denying that despite the positive results of their crackdown, the authorities still face a serious challenge in the fight against drugs. In its annual drug report released on Monday, the authorities say police seized 89.2 metric tons of drugs last year, an increase of nearly 9 percent from 2016, while the number of known drug users in the country rose by nearly 2 percent in 2017 to 2.55 million. New challenges have emerged in the anti-narcotics drive, including the internet as a channel for selling drugs, gangs increasingly using the express delivery companies to transport drugs, and the emergence of new drugs — including those made of noncontrolled chemicals — which can be hundreds of times more potent than traditional drugs. According to the National Narcotics Laboratory, 34 new types of psychoactive substances were introduced in 2017, bringing the total number to 230 nationwide. China has some of the harshest drug laws in the world, with the manufacturing or selling of illicit drugs designated as a capital crime. And several measures have been taken to raise awareness of the anti-drug fight, including providing anti-drug education in communities and rural areas, as well as releasing information about anti-drug work via new media. As a victim that is facing an increased threat of drug inflows from the so-called Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent regions in Southeast and Central Asia, China knows only too well that illicit drugs are closely intertwined with international terrorism and other organized transnational crimes, and that no country can effectively deal with this scourge alone. That is why Beijing has called for a global struggle against narcotics-related crimes that transcends political differences. It has actively participated in the multilateral anti-drug cooperation platform in the Great Mekong subregion and through regional organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In 2016 alone, China solved 87 international and cross-border drug cases in cooperation with more than 20 countries. Such cross-border cooperation must be strengthened for countries to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse.         "
"Winning a trade war is not so easy, Mr President: China Daily editorial",6/26/2018,"                      By using tariffs to force US companies to import less and targeting Chinese investment in high-tech industries in the United States, US President Donald Trump is implementing a simple plan to blunt the competition from China and help create jobs in the US. But it is a strategy that is disrupting the supply chains that are the foundation of the global economy, which include those of the US. By targeting the supply chains of the US' high-tech manufacturers and restricting Chinese investments in US high-tech, the Trump administration aims to disrupt Beijing's own plan to move China's manufacturing up the value chain, and create jobs in the US that it hopes will translate into votes. But in doing so its trade shots are being felt far and wide, not least by itself. While tariffs can be easily and quickly scrapped, the supply chain effects of Trump’s protectionism will not be so easily undone, as its policies are influencing investment decisions that require long-term outlooks. And these decisions, even if by US companies, will not necessarily be in the US' favor. US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, for instance, is voting with its feet against the administration's stance on trade. Having already announced plans to close a factory in Missouri and build one in Thailand, after Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which would have lowered barriers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific — the iconic US company has now announced its plans to move more of its production out of the US, this time to Europe, citing the increased burden Trump’s tariffs have imposed on it. The decision by a manufacturer synonymous with Made in America shows that the administration’s policies are backfiring. And predictably, Harley-Davidson, whose stock price tumbled this week, and its US workers will not be the only victims if the Trump administration persists with its current stance. If the Trump administration continues to resort to coercion to try and achieve its political objectives, it will face more reciprocal measures from its trade partners, which means even more US industries and workers will feel the pain of its policies. While time may heal the damage done by the administration's reveling in ideological willfulness, it would be better for all if it came to its senses and realized there will be no winners in the trade war it is waging.

Mattis' visit an opportunity to stabilize military relations: China Daily editorial,6/25/2018,"                      That US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is reportedly going to adopt a less confrontational stance toward China during his visit to Beijing than he has done recently is to be welcomed, given his earlier stance was in danger of ""poisoning the well"", as he tacitly acknowledged. If, as he told reporters on his plane ahead of his arrival on Tuesday, he is willing to do ""a lot of listening"" and is not coming with any preset ideas, it will certainly be conducive to the two sides reducing some of the bad blood between them. That China and the United States cannot see eye to eye on a variety of issues including the South China Sea and Taiwan has become more evident as their rivalry has intensified. Mattis has himself accused Beijing of ""intimidation and coercion"" in the South China Sea, and last month he rescinded an invitation to the Chinese navy to join the Rim of the Pacific multinational naval exercises organized by the US. That the ""irritants"", as Mattis described them, do not evolve into flashpoints between the two countries requires them to discuss their differences candidly and find ways to resolve or manage them. Both the South China Sea and Taiwan issues are bound to feature in Mattis' talks with high-ranking Chinese officials later this week as the two sides need to reduce the trust deficit that has developed as a result of the Donald Trump administration's strengthening of ties with the island’s independence-minded administration. And with the two militaries increasingly rubbing up against each other in these waters, it is important that the two sides have good communication. Likewise, it is to be hoped that the US defense secretary is not going to pay lip-service to China's concerns while seeking China's support for the US' newly established engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is crucial that the hard-won results in pursuit of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be upheld and the current good momentum be maintained. And the positive developments that have been attained over the past few months should not be jeopardized by any misconceptions about Beijing's role and what it can deliver. Although it is natural for big countries such as China and the US to have areas of competition, the two should have the wisdom and the political will to control their rivalry so that the worst-case scenario of a full-blown confrontation between them can be avoided.

US reshaping rules in bid for economic hegemony: China Daily editorial,6/25/2018,"                      US President Donald Trump reportedly plans to impose restrictions on Chinese companies investing in US tech firms and blocking even more high-tech exports to China under the guise of protecting national security, but such a rules-breaking practice is politicizing business and will lead to investors, Chinese or not, losing trust in the US market. Even though Chinese investments in the US are mutually beneficial — creating jobs, contributing taxes, and bringing funds to the US market — the restrictive measures, which could be announced by the end of this week, are an indication that the Trump administration intends to further obstruct normal business exchanges between China and the United States. By blocking companies with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying US firms involved in ""industrially significant technology"", the Trump administration is attempting to prevent China from growing into a more competitive rival by creating obstacles to the implementation of its Made in China 2025 plan, which the Trump administration views as China's bid to stake its leadership in the key industries of the future. Under the administration’s existing restrictions, US data show that China's investment in US companies had already slumped to $29.4 billion last year from $46.2 billion in 2016. And the move, if finalized, will prompt more enterprises from China to think twice before investing in the US. They will naturally be more cautious about pursuing mergers and acquisitions with US companies knowing that whether a deal is completed or not will be at the whim of the Trump administration. While it is not clear yet whether the move will achieve its intended aim of curbing China's competitiveness, it is certain to aggravate the trade feud between the two sides, which is already roiling the global economy. And while ostensibly, the move only targets foreign companies with a sizable Chinese stake, it sends a dangerous message that the Trump administration will take whatever measures it deems necessary to achieve its policy agenda, regardless of commonly accepted business rules and the business norms that have existed over past decades. The US should treat investors from all countries on an equal footing and create a fair and predictable environment for global investors. Instead, it is intent on attaining economic hegemony. The willful reshaping of rules in this way is so the US can have the development of other countries under its control. That is something countries should rally together to oppose.         "
Taiwan secessionists and US must beware miscalculation: China Daily editorial,6/24/2018,"                          Li Min/China Daily   It would be a miscalculation for secessionists on the island to embrace the actions of the United States as substantial support for ""Taiwan independence"".  That the US Senate passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act early last week calling for joint Taiwan-US military drills and a congressman has put forward a resolution proposing that the United States recognize the island of Taiwan as a ""sovereign and independent country"" may have given them the belief that the US is throwing its weight behind them.  Especially as the two events come just a week after the US-funded American Institute of Taiwan unveiled its new $256 million headquarters in Taipei. And after the US adopted the Taiwan Travel Act early this year.  But if the secessionists believe that means the US will back them in their endeavors, they are being misled by false hope.  If diehard secessionists such as the island's executive head Lai Ching-te - who has explicitly declared himself a ""worker for Taiwan independence"" and claimed that the island is a ""sovereign and independent country"" - pursue their aims because they calculate that the US will support them, they will one day regret their reckoning.  It is not a matter of which power the secessionists can rely on to support them. It is instead a matter of whether what they are doing is in the interests of people across the Taiwan Straits.  People on the island have benefited a lot from the peaceful development of amicable cross-Straits relations in the past years. It should not be difficult for them to see how they have suffered because of the refusal by the island's current administration to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus.  All the moves that the Trump administration has made including the Taiwan Travel Act and noises made by US politicians on US ties with the island are anything but well-intended support for the well-being of people on the island.  If anything, the meddling by the US in the cross-Straits relations will only make the situation even more complicated and dangerous. The more interference from the United States in the cross-Straits relations, the more resolved the Chinese mainland will be to defend its territorial integrity.  And if the US administration believes that it can gain an upper hand over China in other fields such as trade talks by playing the card of Taiwan, they will find they have made a wrong move, as any meddling in the cross-Straits ties which are China's core interest will badly hurt China-US relations.

Trump’s protectionism will disrupt global trade order:China Daily editorial,6/24/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross betrayed the rationale for the United States' trade strategy in an interview with CNBC last week, admitting that US President Donald Trump wants to create an environment of pain for China so that it will give in to his demands.  Given this, it is not hard to understand why Trump has announced further tariffs on Chinese goods and threatened to add more if China hits back.  And it explains why, despite agreed outcomes from the negotiations between the two sides, the United States has gone back on its word in an attempt to extort more concessions from China.  It is clear that the Trump administration will resort to any conceivable means — even those that break international rules — to try and force China to meet its demands.  Ross even admitted that the US had implemented tariffs against Canada, Mexico, Japan and the European Union so they would take action against what he claimed was Chinese dumping.  ""It may sound strange but the fact that we put tariffs on the goods coming out of them has modified their behavior and has induced a pretty high degree of international cooperation against dumping,"" he said.  But by imposing restrictions on the free flow of goods and services in an attempt to obtain its economic and political objectives, the Trump administration is disrupting the global trade order and, more seriously, damaging the value chains and mutual trust among global traders that has been built up over in the past decades.  That is why Beijing has called on countries to stand together to put an end to the US behaving like a rampaging bull in a china shop.  Without making the US feel the pain of the environment it is creating, the Trump administration will continue to take measures that bring chaos to the current global trade order in pursuit of its objectives vis-à-vis China and its jobs-for-votes strategy.  Although the US is the world's largest economy, it can ill-afford the trade war it has lit the fuse to. The costs of trade wars are enormous – The last large-scale trade war, sparked by the large US tariff hikes in 1930, saw the value of world trade decline to just one-third in three years – and the US will also pay a heavy price if it persists with it politically motivated protectionism.  China's sincerity in seeking to find common ground with the US has so far not been reciprocated, but its continued willingness to talk should not be mistaken for weakness. It will not give in to the extortion of the Trump administration.         "
Protectionism symptom of paranoid delusions: China Daily editorial,6/21/2018,"                          Luo Jie/China Daily   Having fallen prey to the manipulative maneuvers of the Donald Trump administration in its bid to present the United States as a victim of unfair trade practices, Chinese investment in the US declined significantly in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year.  According to a report released on Tuesday by Rhodium Group, a research company that tracks Chinese foreign investment, it dropped by 92 percent to only $1.8 billion, its lowest level in seven years.  While Beijing tightened its oversight over outbound investment last year, it is the Trump administration's blitzkrieg on China’s trade and enterprises that is to blame for the decline in Chinese investment, since, overall, China's outbound investment in the first five months increased by 38.5 percent year-on-year, to reach $47.89 billion.  In the same way that it is prone to evoking ""fair trade"" as a justification for its protectionist tariffs, allegations of ""national security risks"" have become the go-to excuse for the Trump administration to scuttle acquisitions in the US by Chinese companies. Alibaba's Ant Financial’s $1.2 billion bid to take over MoneyGram and HNA Group's bid for Skybridge Capital, a hedge fund, were both derailed earlier this year due to regulatory vetoes by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. And new legislation is in the works that will raise the regulatory hurdles still higher by expanding the scope of CFIUS scrutiny.  The approach that the US is taking is self-defeating. The woes the administration is inflicting on Chinese companies do not simply translate into boons for US enterprises and the US economy. The trade relationship between China and the US supports millions of jobs in the US, including those that Chinese companies have created directly through their US investments.  The fast-shrinking Chinese investment in the US reflects the damage being done to China-US trade relations — long considered the cornerstone of bilateral ties — by the trade crusade of Trump and his trade hawks.  Their desire to acquire is perhaps understandable, having promised so much, and giving the evangelical zeal they have for US ascendancy. However, times have changed, and what they are doing now is folly given the global value chains that were primarily forged by the US for its advantage.  The travails of the US economy have been the result of the costly wars the US has pursued and the damage done by the greed and dubious practices exposed by the subprime crisis.  The Rhodium report said that the new tariffs might incentivize Chinese manufacturers to localize production in the US to ‘""hop the tariff wall"". But if Trump and his hawkish advisers were to look beyond the walls of their ideological fortress, they would realize the tariffs are not necessary as the US is not being besieged.         "
US bias and self-focus reducing its influence: China Daily editorial,6/20/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   In yet another example of the go-it-alone stance embraced by the Donald Trump administration, the United States announced on Tuesday that it was withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council, which, since it was founded in 2006, has played an important role in promoting a variety of human rights issues.  US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley described the council as ""cesspool of political bias"" and cited the council's ""disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel"" as the major reason for the US exit.  However, her remarks merely serve as a reminder of her harangue after the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the United States' bias toward Israel when it announced it would move its embassy to Jerusalem, in disregard of UN resolutions.  The US would be happy to rejoin the council, Haley suggested, but only if it adopts the reforms demanded by the US. One of which is that the council abolish its special agenda item which condemns human rights abuses in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.  And despite all the huffing and puffing by Haley and other US officials to justify the move, there is no hiding the fact that the timing of the announcement comes after the UN high commissioner for human rights criticized the US administration for separating children from their parents who illegally cross the border with Mexico, calling the practice ""unconscionable"".  The US move once again highlights the autocratic desires of the Trump administration, which, while claiming it does not want to leave the council, calls for it to reestablish its legitimacy by having a membership of which it approves.  It might not be a bad idea for the US to step aside and reflect on its behavior for a while, rather than criticizing others.  Few, if any, would claim that the Human Rights Council — or indeed the United Nations — is perfect, but the Trump administration cannot expect the UN bodies to act only in support of its objectives. They are supposed to be forums in which all members can have their voices heard.  Yet such dictates have become a tiresome refrain of the Trump administration. We hear them every time the administration pulls the US out of a multilateral pact. From the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord, to the global compact on migration and UNESCO, as well as the Iran nuclear deal, the message is the same, the US is only willing to play with others so long as it gets to write the rules of the game as it goes along.  It is an approach that will do little to serve its interests in the long run.         "
Fresh vitality of old bond holds great promise: China Daily editorial,6/20/2018,"                          Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and president, accompanies top leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un as they greet children at a welcoming ceremony in Beijing on Tuesday. SHEN HONG / XINHUA   Since the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea first began showing its commitment to improving relations with the Republic of Korea earlier this year, Beijing has thrown its weight behind Pyongyang’s efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and seek reconciliation with Seoul and Washington.  The third visit to China in less than three months by Kim Jong-un, top leader of the DPRK, is clear proof of the revitalized friendship between the two neighbors and the close communication between Kim and President Xi Jinping. It also underscores the coordination of Beijing and Pyongyang as they look to bolster the positive outcomes of Kim’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12.  With the easing of situation on the Korean Peninsula having been effectively strengthened by the implementation of the consensus reached between Beijing and Pyongyang and the meeting between Kim and Trump in Singapore, maintaining the current desirable momentum was naturally high on the agenda for the latest talks between Xi and Kim.  Kim’s two-day visit on Tuesday and Wednesday has once again highlighted the crucial role China has been playing as a mediator between the DPRK and the US, as well as the stake it has in regional stability and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Looking forward, though, more still needs to be done to establish a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, and this requires all the parties involved to not only demonstrate political wisdom but also patience. The good relationship and communication Xi has with both Kim and Trump will hopefully be beneficial in this regard, by helping to ensure that Pyongyang and Washington remain on the same page.  Cooperative relations between China and the DPRK have radiated new vitality with their strengthened high-level communication. Kim’s latest talks with Xi will have reassured him that China stands behind the DPRK as it switches its focus to economic development. Something that is clearly a priority for Kim, as he visited an agricultural technology park and rail traffic control center in Beijing on Wednesday.  The consolidation of the friendship between the two countries promises to be beneficial not only to themselves, but also the region. For if the joint efforts of the two longtime friends are reinforced by those of other stakeholders, the prospects for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and regional stability will be greater than they have ever been over the past more than 60 years.

Easing of tax burden promises sense of gain: China Daily editorial,6/19/2018,"                      The planned hike in the individual income tax threshold proposed in a draft amendment to the Personal Income Tax Law is a welcome move to raise people’s incomes and enhance their sense of gain. Seven years have passed since the tax threshold was last raised in 2011 — from 2,000 yuan ($309) to 3,500 yuan — during which the per capita disposable income has increased by more than 7 percent each year, to reach nearly 26,000 yuan in 2017. Raising the threshold is thus a move that reflects that change. The draft amendment that was submitted to the country’s top legislature for discussion on Tuesday is also a direct response to Premier Li Keqiang’s call for personal income tax reform to narrow income disparity and promote social fairness. China’s taxation system embraces the principle that “high-income earners pay higher taxes while low-income earners pay less or no taxes”. Yet that goal has yet to be fully achieved due to deficiencies in the current income tax system. For example, the current tax structure for personal income is very complicated, with progressive rates applied to 11 categories of income. This has led to some people with multiple sources of income evading tax by juggling their income among various tax categories. The draft amendment seeks to plug the loopholes by simplifying the tax structure. For example, by including wages, income from personal services, rewards, and artists’ royalties into one category. And, for the first time, it has a tax-avoidance clause, to which individuals will be subject if they are caught trying to evade tax. The amendment also proposes tax-deductible items for the first time. These include the cost of children’s education and the treatment for serious diseases, as well as the interest payments for housing mortgages and rent, which, should they be implemented, will greatly ease the cost of living, for wage earners in particular. China collected nearly 1.2 trillion yuan in personal income tax in 2017, accounting for about 8.3 percent of all tax revenues for the year. In developed countries, personal income tax accounts for more than 30 percent of tax revenues suggesting that personal income tax still plays a limited role in promoting fairer wealth distribution in China. How to strengthen that role should be a priority in future personal income tax reform.         "
Trump's trade prejudice self-harming the US: China Daily editorial,6/19/2018,"                                             Managing the largest economy in the world, the current US administration tends to attribute all the successes to its own merits while accusing others of being the cause of all the United States' problems.  China, of course, has for a longtime been the favorite whipping boy of the US in this respect, and US President Donald Trump has enthusiastically embraced this meme.  While campaigning for the presidency, Trump accused China of being responsible for ""the greatest theft in the history of the world"", and claimed it was ""raping"" the US. And in his campaign manifesto, he pledged to ""cut a better deal with China"" to help US businesses and workers compete.  Yet, even ignoring the fact those accusations did not and do not accord with the reality of the two countries' trade relations, when a deal was reached on the general framework for rebalancing trade in the recent talks between the two sides, his administration chose not to honor that agreement.      US President Donald Trump. [Photo/VCG]   Having got an inch, it obviously believes it can now grab a mile. For after announcing an initial $50 billion in Chinese imports that would be subject to additional 25 percent on Friday - which Beijing had no option but to respond to with reciprocal tariffs on a variety of US goods - Trump announced on Monday that he had asked US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to suggest another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on which the US could impose an additional 10 percent tariff.  Faced with this heightened intimidation from the US, China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the US to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.      A hostess holds a tray of sliced US beef at an event to celebrate its reintroduction to China in Beijing. [Photo provided to China Daily]   By announcing its plan to impose tariffs on more Chinese goods, the US has escalated its trade assault on China. Beijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration's growing blood lust.  Those US companies and workers that feel the brunt of China's retaliation should pass the word to Washington, that despite the pronounced aim of the Trump administration being to protect domestic industries and workers, the injuries that will be done them will be because of its actions.

Australia's arrogance puts bilateral ties at risk: China Daily editorial,6/18/2018,"                                             Since there are no major differences between China and Australia, the relationship between the two close trading partners should really be plain sailing. However, the rising bias and suspicion harbored by some Australians against China are putting bilateral ties on a rough terrain, which caters to the interests of neither country. Relations have been fraught since last year due to the bias some Australian media have displayed toward China and the remarks of some Australian politicians who have claimed that China has been interfering in Australia's domestic affairs. Even though China has denied exerting any influence in its political process, Australia is due to pass a law banning foreign interference in its internal affairs in two weeks, which is likely to cast a shadow over ties. Exacerbating that gloomy picture, it is expected that Canberra will soon announce that China's Huawei Technologies will be excluded from Australia's 5G mobile broadband project on the grounds of ""national security"". A claim that Huawei said was ""ill-informed and not based on facts"" in an open letter on Monday. The company has even offered to build an evaluation and testing center as part of its 5G proposal so that there can be independent verification of its equipment. If the Chinese company is prohibited from being involved in the next-generation mobile services in Australia, it will further sour business relations between the two countries. However, Canberra's unfair treatment of Huawei is an old issue, and it is considered unlikely that it will change its stance. Even though Australia is the one that will suffer most if ties take a further turn for the worse. Australia should heed the advice of those who say it should refrain from making moves that may negatively affect the trajectory of bilateral interaction. It benefits immensely from its trade and vibrant people-to-people exchanges with China. The establishment of the free trade agreement between China and Australia in 2015 has provided good opportunities and impetus for bilateral trade, the Australian government should not mar that positive picture in cynical pursuit of domestic popularity based on an outdated mentality. In contrast to the provocations of Australia, China has largely exercised restraint so far. But this does not necessarily mean Beijing lacks options to respond to Canberra's growing hostility. It is to be hoped politicians in Canberra will make wiser decisions regarding China, so that it does not push its biggest trading partner into implementing tit-for-tat retaliations.         "
World must resist US wrecking trade system: China Daily editorial,6/18/2018,"                                                 Cai Meng/For China Daily   The US government has used tariff and Section 301 investigations in the past as tools to extort benefits from some of its trade partners. But there are signs that this time it is targeting almost all of its major trade partners, which promises greater harm to the global economy and international trade.  China and other major trade partners of the United States have shown great sincerity in their trade talks with Washington, in an effort to bridge the differences that exist. But the unwillingness of the Donald Trump administration to do likewise has made it almost impossible for any agreement to be reached, especially as it seems that it is willing to renege on any consensus reached.  Although internal political power plays might be a factor behind the Trump administration's welshing on its deals, it is also employing a now-we-agree, now-we-don't strategy to force more and more concessions from the US' trade partners.  The Trump administration is ideologically opposed to what it considers to be the surrendering of its power to regulate foreign trade to the World Trade Organization. It seems intent on sabotaging the world's rules-based international system in favor of the US' might making right. It has already blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO's appellate court in a bid to bring the dispute settlement process to a halt. However, it offers no vision of how global economy should function except that the US should be the main beneficiary.  The US government should heed the lessons of history, as they show that protectionism will not help it achieve its goals.  For instance, the US slapped high tariffs on imports of Chinese tires in 2009, a policy that was intended to protect less competitive domestic tire manufacturers. Estimates by Peterson Institute for International Economics showed that 1,200 jobs in the US tire industry were saved, but ultimately 2,500 jobs were lost in retail because of the increased consumer spending that was spent on tires that could have been spent on other goods.  The US will not be exempt from paying the costs of the trade conflict it has instigated in terms of both jobs and growth. But the bigger price it will have to pay will be for the long-term damage it is doing to the world trade system.  Faced with the insatiable demands of the Trump administration, the rest of the world should come together in defense of their national interests, globalization and the global multilateral trading system.  Countries must jointly act to oppose the smash-and-grab tactics of the US.         "

US protectionism now has a price tag: China Daily editorial,6/17/2018,"                      China's decision to slap an additional 25 percent tariff on 659 types of US goods worth $50 billion should remind the US government that a trade war that it has initiated has a price tag.  China imposed the tariff on US goods such as agricultural products, auto and aquatic products right immediately after the Trump administration announced on Friday tariffs on $50 billion worth Chinese goods. Beijing's quick reaction is an unequivocal manifestation of its determination to safeguard its legitimate interests and fight protectionism.  The White House's tariff decision is a stark violation of the core spirit of consensus reached in recent China-US trade talks and is set to backfire if Washington does not back off from its dangerous adventurism.  The two sides have achieved substantial results in the recent three rounds of negotiations in Washington and Beijing, and there have been promising signs of improving trade relations despite the difficulty to entirely iron out their trade differences in the short term.  The Trump administration's abrupt turn to tariffs, however, has served as declaration of trade war against China and once again betrays its tumultuous, unilateral and willful decision-making style, which is set to undermine normal trade relations between the world's two biggest economies.  What the US should bear in mind is that its unilateral moves will lead to nothing but resolute fighting back from its trade partners, as indicated by China's imposition of tariffs on imported US goods.  Given the frequent flip-flopping of President Donald Trump's administration, it is still too early to conclude a full-blown war will be underway. But China's stance has been consistent: It welcomes dialogue but is not afraid of a trade war. It will not sit idle allowing its core interests to be damaged by any unilateral and protectionist move of any trade partner. The US should not underestimate China's resoluteness in safeguarding its national interest.  And Washington should be responsible for the nullification of previous economic and trade outcomes between the two countries.  China as the world's second-largest economy and the largest consumer market has announced and taken substantial moves to further open its economy, which will provide development opportunities for all countries, including the US. It will be regrettable if US companies and workers fail to benefit from China's economic liberalization moves due to Washington's refusal to cast away its adventurism.  Facing the substantial damage of the US unilateralism and protectionism, the world's major economies, such as China and Europe, should join hands to fight back to teach the US a lesson that it must pay a dear price if it stubbornly sticks to its own way regardless of the interests of other countries.

US should not shun global trade system: China Daily editorial,6/15/2018,"                          Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held a press conference on June 13. [Photo/Agencies]   China's central bank surprised expectations by leaving borrowing costs for interbank loans unchanged on Thursday despite the US Federal Reserve raising benchmark interest rates. A decision that has sparked fresh concerns about the state of the Chinese economy.  It had been expected that the People's Bank of China would raise borrowing costs after the Fed raised benchmark interest rates on Wednesday to reduce the risks of potential capital outflows.  Such voices of doom have been heard each time the Fed has raised rates before, and each time they have proved to be false cries of alarm, since China's policymakers have factored in the Fed's rate hikes into their outlooks.  The slower growth in China's industrial output, investment and retail sales is because the country is persevering with its deleveraging, crackdown on polluting enterprises and advancing the necessary transition from quantity to quality.  And despite the slowdown, the dividends provided by a more open and consumption-driven Chinese economy continue to prove attractive for global investors. An attraction that will only grow now that China's leaders have announced new substantial moves to significantly open the Chinese economy further to global investors.  But the Fed's plan to accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes with two more this year and four next year will exacerbate the global uncertainties that have already been sparked by the economic and trade stance adopted by the United States.  With US President Donald Trump due to meet with his top trade advisers to make a decision on Friday regarding the proposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods from China, there are fears that the trade war between the world's two largest economies, which has been looming on the horizon for the past few months, may be unavoidable. China has pledged any tariffs will nullify any agreements reached in their recent talks, and it will retaliate in kind against the list of US imports it has drawn up.  China still upholds using talks to resolve the trade dispute, as a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Thursday, so it is to be hoped that Trump will hold fire to give the ongoing talks time to work out a solution.  At the same time, it is high time that China and other major economies joined hands to better cope with the challenges created by the US' aggressive pursuit of trade advantages. Greater policy coordination is needed to minimize the ramifications of the US policies and ease the global financial fluctuations, to which some emerging market economies are already falling victim.

US must beware of being dragged into act of folly: China Daily editorial,6/13/2018,"                      Given the global significance of China-US relations, it is natural that they should be constantly in the spotlight. So it is not surprising that the visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to China, which begins on Thursday, has grabbed worldwide attention. Especially as it comes just two days after the historic Singapore meeting between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un.  Aside from allowing them to compare notes on the summit and further coordinate their stances so that the current desirable momentum on the Korean Peninsula can continue, Pompeo’s visit also provides a good opportunity for Beijing and Washington to air their differences on a variety of bilateral issues such as trade, the South China Sea and Taiwan.  While the world’s two largest economies are now deep in negotiations on trade, seeking to avoid a trade war, the frictions between Beijing and Washington over the South China Sea and Taiwan keep sparking heated words.  Washington’s frequent sending of warships and warplanes to sensitive waters has drawn much ire from Beijing, which sees it as a provocation to its sovereignty and security. And the Trump administration’s growing penchant for playing the Taiwan card is also irking Beijing.  On Tuesday, Marie Royce, US assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs, attended a ceremony in Taipei, which marks the unveiling of a new office complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has served as the US representative office after Washington severed “diplomatic ties” with the island in 1979.  The opening, together with the US’ new “Taiwan Travel Act”, shows Washington is now eying a bigger US presence on the island and using Taiwan as a linchpin in its overall containment strategy toward China. But what end is served by such a strategy? It is not good news for China-US ties, the US, or the world, since it only provokes more confrontation between the two sides.  Taiwan remains the most sensitive issue in China-US relations, and Washington should handle the issue with wisdom and dexterity.  Although it can’t be expected to resolve all the issues standing between the two countries, Pompeo’s visit signals that Beijing and Washington are committed to high-level communication to shore up ties. And as long as the two sides discuss their differences in good faith there is no reason why they should not find solid ground on which to do so.         "
"China Daily editorial: After Singapore talks, what comes next?",6/12/2018,"                          Top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong-un (L) meets with US President Donald Trump in Singapore, on June 12, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua, The Straits Times]   It remains to be seen if it was the defining moment in history it was being billed as. Nevertheless, the smooth proceeding of the first ever face-to-face talks between the sitting leaders of the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has yielded positive results.  While it was hard to reconcile nuclear Armageddon with the images of US President Donald Trump and the top leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un shaking hands, having a friendly chat and sitting down to lunch, that has been the concern of the international community, given the hostilities that has festered over the past more than six decades.  The summit therefore marked a significant step forward in meeting expectations for an end to the animosity between the two countries, and for concerted efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and find solutions to the attendant issues.  As China’s Foreign Ministry said, the meeting was a correct and important step. It should not be forgotten how unlikely such a summit was just six months ago. Nor how much effort it took on the part of many to overcome what Kim called the “old prejudices and practices” to make it happen. China has been unswerving in its efforts to facilitate the talks.  Now the commitments that were announced in Singapore need to be delivered on so that the momentum that has built up steam since the beginning of the year can become sustainable and irreversible.  While appreciating the political resolve shown by Kim and Trump, China has urged further dialogue and the continued efforts of all the parties concerned to push forward the peace process and denuclearization.  And it will continue to play its part in seeking to achieve these goals, by firmly supporting the two countries realizing the consensus reached by Kim and Trump in Singapore and providing its continued support to consolidate and expand that consensus.  Since the crux of the Korean nuclear issue is the DPRK’s sense of security, Trump’s promise of unique security guarantees has removed one of the obstacles to a peace agreement, and ultimately the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  While no one should expect the summit to have ironed out all the differences and erased the deep-seated mistrust between the two long-time foes, it has ignited hopes that they will be finally able to put an end to their hostility and that the long-standing peninsula issues can finally be resolved. These hopes should not be extinguished.         "
Singapore summit may mark a new beginning: China Daily editorial,6/11/2018,"                                             It is no exaggeration to say the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un on Tuesday in Singapore could be epoch-making. The denouement to months of diplomatic efforts and the on-off-on-again saga that unfolded after its announcement, the meeting is of great significance. The first between the incumbent leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it is a face-to-face conversation that can set the course of history - for better or worse. Such a meeting seemed impossible less than a year ago, when Trump and Kim were exchanging fiery rhetoric and trading personal insults. Indeed, to many it seemed that conflict was imminent. And even after olive branches were extended and accepted and the meeting agreed, there were still twists in the plot. When the DPRK denounced the US-ROK joint military drills in May and suspended pre-arranged high-level talks with the Republic of Korea because of the drills, many began to doubt whether the summit would go ahead. And their rendezvous seemed to be an increasingly remote possibility with both Trump and Kim threatening to call it off. However, in the hours and minutes between then and now, hasty judgments and words were rescinded. And so it has come to pass that they meet today. China has undoubtedly contributed much to materializing the meeting. It has long called for such direct talks, and it has worked hard as an intermediary to materialize them. It sincerely hopes that Kim and Trump will be able to make breakthroughs when they meet so that the two countries can begin taking steps toward the signing of a belated peace treaty to bring a formal end to the Korean War. And there's the thing, even if there is no immediate substantial outcome from the talks, the Singapore summit can serve as the necessary beginning for achieving this, as it can make it possible for the US and the DPRK to continue their communication to secure their final rapprochement and thus the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Both parties have long considered the other to be an enemy, and it has been a long journey to reach this point. Now Trump and Kim should do their utmost to agree on their next step so as to maintain the positive momentum. This would not only reward all those who have spared no efforts in their attempts to make their meeting a reality, it would also enable both to hail it as a success. Certainly, the world expects them to do nothing less.         "
SCO sets good example for multilateral cooperation,6/11/2018,"                          A lights and fireworks show takes place in Qingdao, the host city of the 18th Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, in East China's Shandong province, June 9, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   The 18th summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which concluded in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, on Sunday, offered a new vision for a more just and equitable world order featuring common security and shared growth, along with open and inclusive international cooperation for better global governance.  As security and stability are indispensable for sustainable development, the members of the regional group vowed to strengthen their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, separatism, extremism and cross-border crimes by conducting joint counter-terrorism drills and enhancing their law enforcement coordination and exchanges of information. Their intention to facilitate peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan will also contribute to this.  Over the years, the SCO has evolved to embrace economic cooperation and common security, and President Xi Jinping's announcement of a 30-billion-yuan ($4.7 billion) special lending facility within the framework of the SCO Inter-bank Consortium will be a shot in the arm for the group's efforts to foster new prospects for the integrated development of the region. This, in addition to the opening of a demonstration area in Qingdao to help advance trade and facilitate investment between China and the other SCO member states, reflects their shared resolve to work together for common prosperity.  Against the backdrop of rising unilateralism and anti-globalization, the SCO's opposition to trade protectionism in any form is especially encouraging, as the global economy cannot afford to turn its back on economic globalization and regional integration, which Xi called the ""compelling trends of our times"".  The SCO member states unanimously agreed to uphold the authority of WTO rules, and strengthen the open, inclusive, transparent, non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading regime. This attracted worldwide attention as it was in sharp contrast with the G7 Summit that ended in Quebec on Saturday with the United States and its allies divided by trade frictions.  The positive outcomes of the SCO summit would not have been possible without the group's guiding principle, the Shanghai Spirit, which advocates mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and the pursuit of common development. This spirit will continue to guide the SCO so it can play a constructive role in maintaining security and promoting prosperity as its members strive to forge a more closely-connected community with a shared future in the region.

Trump's unilateralism challenges global rules: China Daily editorial,6/10/2018,"                                                    US President Donald Trump (right) attends a G7 and Gender Equality Advisory Council meeting as part of a G7 summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 9, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The huge divide between the United States and its allies over issues such as trade meant the magnitude of discord at this year’s G7 Summit was unprecedented for the bloc of leading industrialized nations.  The acrimonious meeting in Quebec is bad news for the group, which is trying to resurrect its waning clout in the world economy, but also for those hoping it would deliver a positive message on global trade.  Instead, the G7 summit only renewed fears that there is a trade war brewing between the US and its trade partners, including its own allies. Although differences between the seven leaders seemed to have been papered over in their joint statement, US President Donald Trump retracted his endorsement of the joint communiqué after the meeting.  And it is Trump’s penchant for going his own way and belief that the US can get its own way in trade by leveraging its economic weight against its trade partners that has sown the seeds of the discord.  Although he seems to calculate the sum of all things in measure and number and weight, Trump’s profit and loss account only serves to present a false picture of global trade ties and obscure the fact that his administration is playing a dangerous game by embracing a go-it-alone approach to world affairs.  While it may seem to offer benefits to the US — and the Trump administration seems to consider the country has no other possibility of success except through such tactics for industries of particular importance to it — it will find it is not immune from the troubles it is creating.  The imposition of tariffs on imports from other countries will not protect US workers, companies and farmers, instead it will lead to retaliation from other countries, and consequently increasingly higher trade barriers and less competition, and ultimately shrinking markets that will hit US businesses and jobs.  The G7 summit has served as another reminder that it is the Trump administration that is challenging the international rules-based order. Considering that the Trump administration has also instigated trade disputes with other countries such as China, the global backlash against Trump’s unilateralist tendencies is gaining momentum. The international community should rally and reject the self-oriented closed-door policies of the US.         "
Qingdao summit will strengthen role of SCO,6/8/2018,"                      The two-day 18th summit of Shanghai Cooperation Organization, set to start on Saturday in Qingdao, Shandong province, will provide an opportunity for regional leaders to address issues ranging from terrorism to energy security, and from economic globalization to people-to-people exchanges.  Given that the organization's members account for nearly half of the world's population and more than one-fifth of the global GDP, any consensuses reached at the meeting will be consequential for security, peace and prosperity in the region and beyond.  The SCO was established in 2001 to strengthen regional security and stability by fighting the ""three evil forces"" of terrorism, extremism and separatism, as well as drug trafficking and cross-border organized crimes. Thanks to institutional and policy coordination, the SCO member states foiled more than 600 terrorist crimes and captured 2,000 members of international terrorist organizations from 2013 to 2017. And with India and Pakistan joining the group last year, the potential for anti-terrorism cooperation has been greatly expanded. The Qingdao summit will undoubtedly help the SCO members improve their capacity for joint security operations and build a more efficient law enforcement cooperation mechanism.  However, over the years, besides security, the SCO has evolved to embrace economic cooperation among its members, especially with additional impetus provided by the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative promoting greater connectivity.  As all the SCO members are located on the Eurasian continent, it is natural that they should seek to explore ways for regional economic integration and shared growth by aligning their development strategies with the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. And this has become a more pressing need now the world is facing the challenges posed by the unilateralism and protectionism of the United States.  If all members continue to embrace the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development, as stated in the SCO Charter, the organization can continue to build on its past success.  For while politeness is useful, harmony is precious. That is why, President Xi Jinping has urged all members to work together to further safeguard regional security and stability, and establish institutional arrangements for regional economic cooperation, as well as more exchanges to enhance understanding among peoples. In doing so, the SCO can release the potential of its expansion and give full play to the organization's advantages.  With the participation of its new members, the Qingdao summit is expected to present a broader vision for the organization's role in the region and further boost its influence.         "
US attempts to bully China are doomed to failure: China Daily editorial,6/6/2018,"                          A photo of Chinese PLA navy fleet taken in April, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   It would be wrong for Washington to consider China’s tolerance of its provocations as a sign of weakness. This would be dangerous. Washington should know by now that China will never give an inch when it comes to its territory.As China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Wednesday, China will not be intimidated no matter how many warships or bombers the United States sends to the South China Sea.She was speaking on Wednesday after the US air force confirmed that two B52 bombers conducted exercises near China’s Nansha Islands, and Washington is reportedly considering sending an aircraft carrier battle group through the Taiwan Straits. These are just the latest provocative moves of the US. They join a long list, including the so-called freedom of navigation operations by its warships in the vicinity of or even within China’s territorial waters in the South China Sea, its sales of weapons to Taiwan, its new “Taiwan Travel Act”, and its officials’ or military officers’ rhetoric about a “China threat”.It is all reminiscent of its past gun boat diplomacy.However, as Hua said, if someone keeps displaying their muscles on your doorstep and peering through your windows, would you ignore it or would you take action?The reiterations by Chinese leaders on numerous occasions that the country’s rise is peaceful and it has no intention to subvert the current international order seems never enough to alleviate the suspicions of Washington that China is a threat to US supremacy. China knows how important its relations with the US are, not only to the interests of both countries but also to the peace and development of the world. And because of this, it tries as much as it can to keep the differences and even disputes with the US under control. It always puts the large picture of China-US relations as well as the world situation before its grievances on specific matters.But that does not mean it will concede ground to Washington’s strong-arm tactics. It has its bottom line. Should the US send an aircraft carrier battle group through the Taiwan Straits, it would quite likely send the wrong signal to the secessionists on the island. And any move by the island to declare “independence” would be consequential. The US should think carefully before rocking the boat in that way. No one should underestimate China’s resolve to defend its territorial integrity. It will never compromise on this.            "
Odds on saving Iran deal don't look good,6/6/2018,"                          File photo shows US President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement after signing it in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, US, May 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The impact of the United States' unilateral exit from the landmark Iran nuclear accord is sinking in, with Iran's Atomic Energy Organization spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi saying on Tuesday that Iran is to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that it will start the process to increase the country's uranium enrichment capacity.  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that he had ordered the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to prepare to begin to increase uranium enrichment, although it is to remain within the framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the time being.  Yet despite the efforts by the major European Union countries and other parties to keep a grip on the multilateral deal with Iran, it is apparently not within their control.  With an increasing number of European enterprises withdrawing from Iran, its economy that had just started to revive, will probably suffer a sharp dive.  Of course, there is no reason for Iran to suffer economic sanctions when it has abided by the nuclear restrictions it agreed to under the deal, as evidenced by the inspections of the UN nuclear watchdog.  Yukiya Amano, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Monday that Iran had continued to comply with the nuclear deal even after the US withdrawal.  That also explains why the other parties involved in the deal are trying to save the deal even after the US pulled out.  However, if Iran restarts its process to increase its uranium enrichment capacity and even advance such efforts in the direction of developing nuclear weapons, which will very likely hasten the US' imposition of secondary sanctions and possibly further action, all the multilateral efforts that have been made in the past many years for reconciliation between the West and Iran will come to naught.  The US' unilateral withdrawal from this multilateral deal has not only deeply dented its own credibility, it has set a very bad precedent in international relations and made the situation in the Middle East even more complicated and potentially more volatile.  It seems that no one can tell how much room is left for the other parties involved in the deal to try in their attempts to save it. Neither can anyone tell how much the US will gain from its move.  The US seems unable to relax, passing the time in a state of fear commensurate with the harm it does to others. It should learn to forgo its hasty actions, as it would stop causing so much trouble.         "
US playing zero-sum game,6/5/2018,"                          An operator uses a hoist to lift a coil of aluminium at the Neuf-Brisach Constellium aluminium products company's production unit in Biesheim, Eastern France, April 9, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The United States tariffs on steel and aluminum products from Europe, Mexico and Canada that came into effect on Friday, drew a heated response from Europe, Canada and Mexico and promises of retaliatory actions against US exports.  Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said the European Union would move ahead with tariffs on US products, including motorcycles, denim, cigarettes, cranberry juice and peanut butter, that are expected to be in place by June 20 and will affect roughly $7.5 billion worth of US exports.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the US tariffs are ""totally unacceptable"" and called them an ""affront"" to the security partnership between the United States and Canada. Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, outlined Canada's plan for dollar-for-dollar tariffs retaliation on US steel and aluminum products.  The Mexican government also said it will impose punitive tariffs on steel plate, lamps and lanterns, pig legs, sausage, apples, grapes and cheese products imported from the US, on a scale equivalent to the losses it suffers from the US tariffs.  The US' huge trade deficit is a structural problem related not only to the current global value chain, but also to the status of the dollar as a leading global reserve currency. Its trade deficit is a result of its long-time offering of US dollars to other countries, and so cannot be resolved through the simple imposition of duties. Protectionism is a tactic that ""kills 10,000 enemies but at the cost of 8,000 soldiers"". And this time the US is targeting its close allies the EU and Canada.  US President Donald Trump's logic is: The US suffers from free trade with other countries, so he is trying to pressure them to open wider to the US through threatening punitive tariffs even against its allies. By doing so, Trump is attempting to send an unequivocal message to the world that if other countries do not make concessions as required, the US is ready to proceed with a trade war.         "
"No matter how famous, everyone has to pay tax",6/5/2018,"                          An employee counts Chinese one-hundred yuan banknotes at the Bank of China Hong Kong headquarters in Hong Kong, Nov 12, 2016. [Photo/VCG]   The exorbitant salary of celebrities in China's entertainment sector has always been a source of public complaints, not only because it reflects the widening wealth gap in society, but also because such income has often been made illegally, through ""hidden industry rules"".  That's why the announcement by the State Administration of Taxation that it is conducting a thorough investigation into alleged tax evasion by a famous actor has attracted much attention.  As the studio concerned is registered in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, the local tax authority is conducting the inquiry.  The move comes after two contracts were posted online detailing the terms and conditions for an actor to work on a movie. One was said to be the real contract, and the other with a lower payment and perks was alleged to be for tax purposes. Such ""double contracts"" have long been used in the industry, the poster claimed.  It will take time for the investigators to find out whether the film star has evaded paying tax, a criminal charge that the studio has denied. But throughout the investigation, the actor will be treated the same as anyone else, the administration said. Since everyone is equal before the law, the star's celebrity status will not influence the outcome, and if any actions are found to have broken the law, the relevant parties will be punished.  The administration is already looking at tax avoidance in the film industry, and it has said it is strengthening its supervision.  The incident has once again put the spotlight on movie stars and the film industry. For despite the Chinese film industry's boom in recent years, with its box office set to become the world's largest, the quality of most movies still leaves a lot to be desired.  The high payments for on-screen talent have been part of this problem, since investors, in order to make profits, tend to rely only on the A-list stars with box office appeal to guarantee a return on their investments. This has created a soaring cycle of higher payments for stars at the cost of the money spent on other aspects of production, such as scriptwriting, production, editing, sound and music.  The fight against unreasonably high payments must continue for the film industry to continue to prosper and yield more quality films. And the scrutiny of contracts and income must be carried out to ensure those in the industry pay tax on their full incomes according to the rules.         "
US and Chinese military need to increase mutual trust,6/3/2018,"                          The missile destroyer    Jinan of the People's Liberation Army Navy arrives at Mayport naval stations in Jacksonville, Florida, during a visit to the US on Nov 3, 2015. [Photo/VCG]   There was more bickering between China and the United States at the 17th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on the weekend.  And given the provocative actions US warships have repeatedly taken in the South China Sea due to Washington's miscalculations of what China has done in its attempt to defend its own territorial waters, it is necessary for both militaries to sit down and talk.  It is beyond doubt that whether the world's largest developed country and largest developing country can better manage their differences is the key to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large.  The US military should never underestimate the resolve of its Chinese counterpart to defend its territorial integrity and its sovereignty. Both sides need to do whatever they can to prevent any contingencies from escalating into a direct conflict.  What is badly needed is mutual trust. And communication is the way to establish that trust. More communication will help each side better understand each other's bottom lines and thus know where to toe the line. More communication will also help both sides to work out ways to better manage or even shelve their differences  As far as the South China Sea is concerned, China has no intention of interfering with freedom of navigation except for its efforts to defend its own territorial waters. In addition, China has reiterated that it will do its utmost to solve or manage the territorial disputes with its neighbors through dialogue.  As for the Taiwan question, there has been no misunderstanding between the US and China about the island’s status. The situation across the Taiwan Straits should not deteriorate unless the island authorities misinterpret any message from the US or the latter sends a wrong signal bolstering the nerve of secessionists on the island. Either one will likely become the source of increased tensions across the Straits.  US Secretary of Defense James Mattis said in Singapore that the US would continue to pursue “cooperation whenever possible”, and that he would visit Beijing soon at China’s invitation. He also mentioned that the US military will seek to strengthen mutual trust with its Chinese counterparts.  Patience on the part of the US military is needed to listen to what its Chinese counterpart say about the South China Sea and about what China’s military has done there. And it is also imperative for the US to understand where China’s core interest lies and its needs as a rising power in terms of its defense strategy.         "
Actions to maintain healthy trade ties must be reciprocal: China Daily editorial,6/3/2018,"                        Patience often prevails over force when confronting a problem. Many difficulties that cannot be overcome in one go can be overcome when tackled little by little. It is such an approach that is hopefully paying dividends in the economic and trade talks between China and the United States.  Although the two sides reached consensus on some key issues during the Washington talks last month, and they agreed to put a trade war on hold, the statement released by the White House on Tuesday, announcing that it was intending to go ahead with its plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese high-tech goods, cast a shadow over that agreement and raised doubts about how productive the weekend talks would be between the world’s two biggest economies.  However, the outcome of the discussions suggests that the two sides have continued to adopt a constructive attitude in their negotiations, which has enabled them to make progress.  According to a statement issued by the Chinese side on Sunday, the two sides have had good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy, and have made concrete progress.  But with US President Donald Trump having taking a generally more contentious stance toward China, there is always the possibility that the US will turn around later and express a different view.  That is why, China stated that if the US implements trade sanctions, including the planned tariffs already announced, the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two parties will not take effect.  Trump claims that he is seeking fairness and reciprocity in the US' economic relationship with China, but so far he has sought to extort gains from China using the economic advantages the US has, and sought to attack China's intellectual property rights to impede its progress in endogenous high-tech.  But although the aggressive policies the US has announced would harm China's economy and impede its technological headway, they would also mean economic recession and unemployment in the US.  They represent divergence and mutual pain rather than convergence and mutual gain.  The competitive aspect of the US-China relationship has come to the fore recently, with trade an evident bone of contention, and this holds the potential for tremendous trouble.  But by engaging in dialogue with good faith, the two sides can turn their great troubles into little ones and then little ones into none at all, as a Chinese saying advises.         "
Sign that entrepreneurs' rights are better protected: China Daily editorial,5/31/2018,"                                             China's top court has overturned the guilty verdict handed down to the founder and former chairman of Wumei Holdings Group almost 10 years ago. Zhang Wenzhong was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud, embezzlement and bribery in a final ruling by Hebei High People's Court in 2009. The Supreme People's Court has overturned that verdict citing insufficient evidence and wrongful application of the law by the lower-level court after a retrial was granted in answer to Zhang's appeal in 2016. In its statement, the supreme court said there was no evidence Zhang had appropriated funds for his own benefit, adding that the earlier rulings had ""made errors"". The case involved the property rights of a private enterprise, an area that for a long time was ill-defined as the country transitioned from a planned to market economy. This has led to a number of cases such as Zhang's, raising worries over the business environment for private companies. The poor protection of property rights has been a major obstacle to the development of the private sector, and prompted some entrepreneurs to move their capital overseas. However, guidelines were issued in November 2016 to enhance the protection of property rights to raise people's sense of wealth security, boost social confidence, and increase the impetus for private entrepreneurship and innovation. And the decision by the Supreme People's Court to quash Zhang's conviction demonstrates that the Communist Party of China Central Committee is resolved to strengthen the protection of property and entrepreneurs' lawful rights and interests, the court said on its micro blog. Procedures for Zhang to claim compensation and the recovery of fines and property are to be launched in accordance with the law. Zhang may consider himself lucky as the rate for retrial is extremely low in China — at less than 0.3 percent. But Thursday's decision by the Supreme People's Court shows that the country is not just paying lip service to those guidelines and it is strengthening the protection of property rights through the comprehensive promotion of the rule of law. It is to be hoped that lessons can be learned from this and other cases, and the guidelines can be effectively applied to ensure that private enterprises and individuals have confidence their legitimate rights and interests are fully protected.

US insists on playing its zero-sum game in Asia: China Daily editorial,5/31/2018,"                                             By renaming the US Pacific Command the US Indo-Pacific Command, Washington is sending an unmistakable message that it wants to use its Indian Ocean allies and partners to contain China. The change of name was announced by US Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Wednesday in Hawaii, the command's headquarters, and his remarks and those of outgoing commander Admiral Harry Harris made it clear that this is because of China. Harris described China as the biggest long-term challenge to the United States, and said that it required the ""focused involvement and engagement"" of the US and its allies and partners to prevent China realizing ""its dream of hegemony in Asia"". Clearly for some the Cold War never ended. Although it is just a change in name and involves no fundamental shifts in the deployment of US military assets, it's a recognition of the increasing importance Washington attaches to the Indian Ocean, and to India as a buyer of arms. It also shines a spotlight on the US' outdated strategic thinking, which views international relations as a zero-sum game. Its willful erasing of Asia, with its many cultures and peoples, shows that its strategy is intended to maintain its own hegemony rather than for the good of the region. A judgment based more on hope than reason. Given its confrontational nature, there should be no surprise that countries in Asia are worried that the strategy will only serve to stir up turbulence in the region. The US stance is having a malign influence in Asia as it is undermining the concerted efforts being made by countries in the region to work together for its development. China has repeatedly said the Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the US. It has no intention or desire to engage in great power competition with the US either in the Asia-Pacific or elsewhere. But the US practice of stubbornly clinging to the strategic misperception of viewing China as an adversary means China has no choice but to prepare for the worse. But from scrapping multilateral agreements to imposing tariffs on trade partners and allies, the unilateral moves taken by the Donald Trump administration have provoked a strong backlash from other countries, including its allies. This does not bode well for the US' Indo-Pacific strategy, which is likely to run aground on the rocks of Trump's America-first-and-only approach to international affairs.         "
Italy turmoil shows that EU is still vulnerable to populism: China Daily editorial,5/30/2018,"                                             Italy has been without a government since elections in March because no political party has been able to form a majority. Two populist parties the Five Star and the League attempted to join forces but had to abandon the effort after Italian President Sergio Matterella vetoed their choice of a euroskeptic finance minister on Sunday. On Wednesday, it was reported the two parties were trying to ""compromise on another name"" for the post and soliciting support from the Brothers of Italy, another right-wing party. However, the move by Matterella suggests that he is trying to prevent his country from following the United Kingdom’s lead and exiting the European Union, which would deal an even heavier blow to the European economic bloc than Brexit did, as it is the fourth-largest economy in the EU and the third-largest member of the eurozone. It was this concern that caused the stock markets to plunge on Tuesday. Matterella's handpicked prime minister, Carlo Cottarelli, a former director at the International Monetary Fund, is thought unlikely to secure a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as the major parties are calling for Mattarella to dissolve it and send the country back to the polls in July. If that is the case, it is forecast that the two populist parties would win an even greater majority in parliament, with fears the election would become a de facto referendum on whether or not the country should leave the EU. Although it is not clear if the populists would want to run on that platform, they are determined to increase government spending at a time when the country's government debt is the third-highest in the world and pushing for revision of the fiscal rules for the eurozone and reform of the EU. This would put more pressure on the EU which is struggling to get its house in order. If Mattarella's move was necessary to try and protect Italy's position in the eurozone and thus defend the unity of the EU, it is more than necessary for the EU leaders to reflect as thoroughly as possible on why populism has surged so rapidly and strongly in many European countries. They need to reflect on whether European integration has delivered what was expected of it, and if not why not.         "
US should uphold consensus and not be double-faced: China Daily editorial,5/30/2018,"                                             Despite the truce in the trade hostilities between the United States and China that was agreed less than two weeks ago after their talks in Washington, the White House on Tuesday announced it is ready to pull the trigger on tariffs and other measures to protect US technology and intellectual property from what it called China's ""discriminatory"" trade practices. Although China responded that this was within its expectations, it has understandably been irked by the US reneging on the Washington agreement. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday the US was eating its words and squandering its credibility in international relations. That the trade spat has flared up again after the Washington meeting seemed to have taken the heat out of it, has sparked fresh concerns about the impact it could have on the global economy and value chains. On Wednesday, the OECD added its cautionary note alongside those previously issued by the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. China on its part is genuinely trying to defuse tensions and reach a settlement. It reiterated on Wednesday that it does not want to fight, although it will stand up for itself if forced to. It hopes to reach an agreement through constructive dialogue. But although the latest move by the US might be an attempt to leverage some concessions from China during US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' upcoming talks in Beijing, China should be prepared for more arbitrary and wayward actions by the US, since the Donald Trump administration seems to be intent on targeting China’s ability to compete with it in the high-tech arena. According to reports, the US State Department is now going to cut the length of the visas issued to Chinese science and technology students from June 11, particularly those studying robotics, aviation and high-tech manufacturing, sectors China identified as priorities in its Made in China 2025 plan aimed at moving its manufacturing up the value chain. Despite higher education being an area where the US actually runs a surplus with China - Chinese students account for about one-third of the 1 million foreign students enrolled at US schools - Washington seems willing to cut off its nose to spite its face, concerned that they will somehow gain access to secrets that will give China a helping hand in knocking the US off its high-tech pedestal. This shows how hard it will be for China to satisfy the US' demands without doing itself harm. However, it should continue to do what it can to convince the US that confidence should not become recklessness and a trade-off is in the interests of everyone.         "
Trump's revival of tariff plan not beyond expectations: China Daily editorial,5/30/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The White House on Tuesday issued a statement announcing that it was taking steps ""to protect domestic technology and intellectual property"" from what it called China's ""discriminatory and burdensome trade practices"".  The steps include a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods containing ""industrial significant technology"" – with a list to be released by June 15 – along with the implementation of specific investment restrictions and enhanced export controls.  The move to finalize the March plan comes just 10 days after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared the looming trade war with China had been put on hold, and ahead of the arrival of US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Beijing on Saturday for further talks on trade.  China's Ministry of Commerce responded by saying it was surprised by the move which was contrary to the consensus reached in Washington earlier this month, but said it was within China's expectations.  It is US President Donald Trump's common practice to ratchet up the stakes in this way in a bid to leverage concessions. And after the two sides reached a general agreement in their talks in Washington that it would be in both their interests to avoid a trade war, the devil it seems is now in the details.  It is to be hoped that the cut-and-thrust of the haggling will produce results as it is time this dispute was finally settled.  However, notably as the White House statement makes clear as well as having a bee in its bonnet about the trade deficit with China, the Trump administration now has another about China's plan to upgrade its industry.  China's Made in China 2025 is a blueprint for moving China's industry higher up the value chain, and this has prompted the Trump administration to try and defend the US' high-tech advantages by accusing China of forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft, and using the threat of the tariffs and restrictions to coerce China to enhance US companies' access to the Chinese market to ""expand exports"".  But as Chinese Ambassador to the World Trade Organization Zhang Xiangchen said on Monday at a WTO meeting, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has failed to produce “a single piece of evidence” to support its claims and there is nothing in its regulatory measures that requires technology transfer from foreign companies. If a US company thinks a deal is not worthwhile, it can simply choose not to proceed with it.  China has also made continual progress in strengthening intellectual property rights protection. According to calculations by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, China’s payment of licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technologies reached almost $30 billion in 2017, nearly four times the level a decade ago.  While Washington considers that the US is in a race with China for technological leadership, a change of perspective would allow it to see that cooperating in high-tech would make the cake bigger for both.

Reducing plastic waste is shared responsibility: China Daily editorial,5/29/2018,"                                             Almost 10 years have passed since China implemented a nationwide ban on retailers distributing bags free of charge, and banned the production, sale and use of ultrathin non-biodegradable bags. Unfortunately, however, the ban that came into effect on June 1, 2008, has failed to achieve its purpose of eliminating plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeters from the market, as such bags are still given away free to customers at roadside stalls and small shops. Indeed, they are just part of China's plastic bag problem. Large supermarkets and department stores charge customers for thicker plastic bags, but the fee is just too low — at 0.2 yuan (3 US cents) or 0.3 yuan — to dissuade customers from using them. Worse, the rapid development of online shopping and food delivery services means the country is under unprecedented pressure to deal with its mounting plastic waste. In 2016 alone, the express delivery industry used 12 billion plastic bags — four times the number for 2008 - as well as 14.4 billion packaging boxes and 24.7 billion meters of adhesive tape. For the country's environmental cleanup to succeed, it must reduce the huge amounts of plastic waste that are produced. The National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner, recently promised to explore new ways to reduce the plastic waste that is fast piling up, especially the waste packaging generated by the rapid rise of online retail and takeout food. The lessons of the past need to be heeded for any new measures to be effective. The ban on ultrathin plastic bags has been flouted mainly because of lax law enforcement, which has enabled their manufacturing and sale to continue unchecked. Also, many of the so-called biodegradable plastic bags are not really biodegradable. Even if they are, they cost two to three times as much as non-biodegradable bags, which deters cost-sensitive businesses from using them. It is not only businesses that need to change their behavior, efforts must be made to raise consumers' awareness of the consequences of using plastic bags. And it has been projected that by 2050 the amount of plastic in the oceans will outweigh all the fish. And it is worth bearing in mind that as it breaks up micro plastic particles can enter the food chain. A healthy environment is the responsibility of everyone, not just the government and businesses.         "
Not in China's interests to force technology transfers: China Daily editorial,5/29/2018,"                                             The United States has repeatedly claimed that China has forced foreign companies to transfer their technologies to local businesses, an accusation that it has not backed up with evidence. US officials, including President Donald Trump, have claimed that China has exploited ""vague"" investment rules to force foreign companies to share technology with their Chinese partners if they want to access the Chinese market. But this allegation is being used as an excuse to facilitate its trade protectionism and coerce China to accept other economic demands by the US. As Chinese Ambassador to the World Trade Organization Zhang Xiangchen said on Monday at a WTO meeting, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has failed to produce ""a single piece of evidence"" to support its claim. It is easy for the US to point its finger at China in this way as there have been technology transfers between the US companies and their Chinese partners. But these are the result of normal business practices, not coercive policies. As Zhang said on Monday, although the US claims China is forcing US companies to transfer technologies by imposing joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations and administrative licensing procedures, ""nothing in these regulatory measures requires technology transfer from foreign companies"". If a US company thinks a deal is not worthwhile, it can choose not to proceed with it. The Chinese authorities have also made continual progress in strengthening intellectual property rights protection. Reflecting this, China's payment of licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technologies has soared in recent years. According to calculations by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, they reached almost $30 billion in 2017, nearly four times the level of a decade ago. The institute further pointed out that China ranks fourth globally in the amount of licensing fees paid for acquiring foreign technology, ahead of such developed economies as Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea. And to try and force companies to transfer their technology would not cater to China's interests since it would deter foreign investment, which is very important for the country's economic development. China is committed to opening its doors wider and improving the environment for foreign investment. Instead of being at each other's throats, the two sides should seek to properly manage their differences and jointly promote the sound and stable development of their economic relations and trade.

US misconduct rooted in zero-sum mindset: China Daily editorial,5/28/2018,"                                             The United States' growing penchant for conducting so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea has prompted fears that there might be a head-on clash between the US and China. Sunday's incident in which two US warships were driven away by the Chinese navy after they entered into China's territorial waters around the Xisha Islands only aggravated these worries. As on previous occasions, the US move was met with strong opposition by China, as such actions cannot be interpreted as friendly or peaceful. They are blatant provocations, which undermine strategic mutual trust between the two militaries and damage peace, stability and good order in the busy waters of the South China Sea. The US always cites international law and safeguarding access to the waters as the pretexts for its freedom of navigation operations. But neither of these justifications holds water as the US is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and freedom of navigation in the waters has never been a problem. To try and give its provocative moves in the South China Sea the gloss of altruism, the US also points an accusing finger at China and claims its naval operations are a response to China militarizing the waters. But by repeatedly sending its warships to the South China Sea, the US is finding it more and more difficult to conceal the fact that it is the real culprit for the militarizing of the waters. Its accident-prone provocations are increasing the risk of an accidental incident. Sunday's action by the US and other provocative moves in the South China Sea in recent years highlight why China is making efforts to build a blue-water navy. It has to improve its maritime capabilities so that it can better protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity and maritime interests. China does not seek a confrontation with the US in the South China Sea. It has repeatedly urged the US to properly handle the differences between the two countries and abandon its zero-sum mentality so that it can contribute to building peace and stability in the region. The US should end its ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the waters and instead try to make military-to-military relations a stable factor in China-US relations. Doing so would serve the interests of both sides and the region, unlike the US' present course of action that threatens a deterioration in regional stability and risks a dangerous disturbance.

Accepting one-China principle the only way out for Tsai: China Daily editorial,5/27/2018,"                                                 Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Alpha Barry sign a joint communique to resume diplomatic relations between China and Burkina Faso, in Beijing, capital of China, May 26, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   West African nation Burkina Faso's resumption of diplomatic relations with China on Saturday is anything but a surprise.  Admitting that there is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China is non-negotiable if any country wants to develop diplomatic ties with China.  What Taiwan's secessionists feel about the island's declining number of ""diplomatic allies"" and what the island's leader Tsai Ing-wen says about it makes no difference, and there is nothing her administration can do to turn the tide.  As an increasing number of Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" sever official ties with the island and seek diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland, the island will become increasingly isolated and its international space will further shrink.  It has become increasingly evident that it is in the interests of the island for Tsai to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus and accept the fact that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China. On that basis, amicable relations across the Taiwan Straits would be able to resume.  It is high time that Tsai reflected on her refusal to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus. Although it has given the island's secessionists a shot in the arm, it has chilled cross-Straits relations. Without her ill-oriented mainland policy, the island's executive head Lai Ching-te would not have gone so far as to explicitly declare himself as a ""worker for Taiwan independence"" and claimed that the island is a ""sovereign and independent country"".  What the secessionists have been up to is at the expense of the well-being of Chinese compatriots on the island and of the future of the island as well.  But the rapid shrinking of its international space and worsening of its economy in the past two years since Tsai Ing-wen took office as the leader in 2016 suggests that seeking ""Taiwan independence"" is a dead end and the room in which the secessionists can maneuver is becoming increasingly small.  For the well-being of the people on the island and for its peaceful reunification with the mainland, accepting the one-China principle is the only way out.  There is no chance at all for the island to secede from China whatever the secessionists do.         "
Future of peninsula peace in hands of Kim and Trump: China Daily editorial,5/27/2018,"                                             The on, off, on-again meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un has highlighted the complexity of the Korean Peninsula issues and how formidable a task it is to resolve them peacefully through talks. Plans for the summit are moving ""very nicely"", Trump said on Sunday, having already done a 180 on the letter he sent to Kim on Thursday canceling the meeting. A White House team reportedly left as scheduled for Singapore over the weekend to prepare for the summit.  Trump's brinkmanship led to a hastily arranged meeting between Kim and Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in on Saturday, in which Kim told Moon he considered the Singapore summit a historic opportunity to end decades of confrontation – a view that most would probably agree with.  But Moon told reporters on Sunday that Kim's concern is whether his country can truly trust the United States and its promise to end hostile relations.  Such concerns are not unreasonable since Washington has seemed intent on aggravating those concerns with talk of Libya-style regime change and, in Trump's letter, the implied threat of a nuclear strike. That Seoul has agreed to discuss with Pyongyang a possible non-aggression pact and start talks on a peace treaty to replace the armistice agreement is a welcome move that may help ease Pyongyang's fears. However, ultimately, Washington will need to demonstrate it is willing to do the same. It is the lack of trust between the two parties that is the major obstacle to achieving permanent peace on the peninsula. The US wants to relieve its own security fears with “complete, verifiable and irreversible” denuclearization by Pyongyang before giving the latter security guarantees and economic assistance. While Pyongyang wants to denuclearize in stages, with corresponding reciprocal actions from the US . This is hardly common ground. Yet direct talks between the Kim and Trump are imperative if the efforts to reduce tensions are to realize the permanent peace dividend that now seems to be tantalizingly within reach. Washington and Pyongyang should hold dear the progress that has been made and not spoil the gains that have already been achieved with impatience.  The momentum for peace on the peninsula has never been stronger, and it should not be abused. Pyongyang and Washington need to confirm their shared will to meet face-to-face and instill confidence that they will be talking in good faith when they do.         "
How to lose friends the Tsai way,5/26/2018,"                      Loss of 'diplomatic partners' erodes 'legitimacy' of Tsai China and Burkina Faso resumed diplomatic relations on Saturday, after the West African country severed ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan on Thursday. After the Dominican Republic, it is the second country to do so within one month. Since Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen assumed office two years ago, four countries have cut their ""diplomatic ties"" with the island and the number of countries having ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan has dropped to 18. That shows the last few countries refusing to recognize the one-China principle in the world have started changing their mind. The Taiwan authorities might try to stop this, but it is an irreversible trend for them to lose ""diplomatic partners"". It is out of their own national interests that these countries decided to sever ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. In the past, Taiwan authorities used to purchase ""diplomatic ties"", namely maintaining ties with certain countries by offering economic and other assistance to them. However, as the Chinese mainland gains more influence in the world, these countries want to keep good ties with it. That is also what the four countries' governments pointed out when announcing their decision. Just like Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, this is a correct decision made by the Burkina Faso government, in keeping with the trend of the times and the world. Besides that, the pro-""independence"" attitude and activities of the Taiwan authorities also helped to worsen the situations for Taiwan. When former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou was in power, he recognized the 1992 Consensus which embodies the one-China principle, and strongly objected to the so-called ""Taiwan-independence""; As a result, cross-Straits ties remained well in general, and Taiwan did not lose any of its ""friends"" within eight years. In comparison, the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party has lost points in ""diplomacy"" while ruling the island. Tsai has so far lost four ""diplomatic partners"" in the past two years; Chen Shui-bian, another DPP leader who supported pro-independence activities, lost nine ""diplomatic partners"" when he was in power from 2000 to 2008. The loss of ""diplomatic partners"" is eroding the ""legitimacy"" of the Taiwan authorities. Especially, the fact that increasingly fewer countries recognize the Taiwan authorities in the international society shows the authorities have little and still less influence globally. Within the island, the DPP is also losing appeal to voters because its leaders cannot keep the status quo as they promised during elections. Their promises have already been broken. Tsai might try taking counter-measures. After Burkina Faso announced severing ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan on Thursday, the Taiwan authorities had already taken ""counter-measures"" by limiting mainland residents from travelling to Taiwan. It can be expected that Tsai might invest more money to maintain ""diplomatic ties"" with its remaining 18 ""friends"". Reports show that the Taiwan authorities even promised to provide monetary assistance to Solomon Islands to host Pacific Games. Besides, it might also improve actual ties with the US. The Chinese mainland must be cautious about the possible actions the Taiwan authorities might take. But whatever they do, the trend of China's rise and the end of separatism in Taiwan is irreversible. The only correct choice for the Taiwan leaders is to come back to the 1992 Consensus and stick to the one-China principle. The author is an associate researcher at the Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.         "
Contacts should continue even if summit cancelled: China Daily editorial,5/25/2018,"                          President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un are planned to meet on June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un may or may not be taking place on June 12 as planned.  Trump informed Kim in a letter on Thursday that he was canceling the meeting because of the DPRK's recent ""hostility"".  ""Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,"" Trump wrote in his letter, which was released by the White House.  The anger shown by the DPRK that Trump cited as the reason for the meeting being called off is understandable. The DPRK called US Vice-President Mike Pence ""ignorant and stupid"" after he said the country could ""end like Libya"". The second time Pyongyang was threatened with this fate ahead of the meeting after Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton also spoke of that possibility.  Since the Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi was killed by US-backed rebels eight years after he gave up his nuclear weapons program, such comments are bound to spook Pyongyang, as no doubt intended.  Trump also spoke of the United States' ""massive and powerful"" nuclear capabilities in his letter, saying he hoped they would never ""have to be used"". All of which has served to highlight the existential threat that prompted Pyongyang to pursue nuclear weapons in the first place. A threat that has been ratcheted up despite Trump saying on Tuesday that ""He (Kim) will be safe. He will be happy. His country will be rich"".  With its cheeky invitation for Kim to ""call or write"" to set up a meeting, the letter did not slam the door shut on talks. Something he stressed later saying it required ""concrete steps"" from the DPRK. It is worth bearing in mind that despite the letter's grandstanding, Trump said on Tuesday, in a meet-the-media with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, that they were working on something with the DPRK. Something that might not work out for June 12, but ""that doesn't mean it won't work out over a period of time"".  An end to hostilities and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are the goals that many countries have been working for in the past decades. Which is true of China, whatever, Trump might suggest to the contrary. It has urged the DPRK and the US to hold firm their commitment to dialogue in order to move relations forward.  After 65 years some maneuvering is to be expected, but all parties need to keep in contact and work toward the same goals.         "
'Negative mindset' cause of unnecessary friction: China Daily editorial,5/24/2018,"                          Chinese Navy hospital ship Peace Ark arrives in the Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the United States, on June 29, 2016. A Chinese fleet with about 1,200 soldiers and officers arrived in the Pearl Harbor Wednesday to take part in the Rim of the Pacific 2016 (RIMPAC 2016) multinational naval exercise. [Photo/Xinhua]   The Pentagon rescinded its invitation on Wednesday for the Chinese navy to join the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise organized by the US Navy, accusing Beijing of ""continued militarization"" of the South China Sea.  By excluding China from the world's largest international naval exercise, which the Chinese Navy joined in 2014 and 2016, the Pentagon has reversed course on the cooperative momentum between the two countries' militaries in noncombat areas, thus increasing the chance of a misunderstanding or even miscalculation.  Military-to-military engagement and participation in multilateral exercises can help build trust and goodwill and prevent a crisis from escalating into conflict, which is why Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the decision was ""unhelpful"".  But the unconstructive move should perhaps come as no surprise, given the United States has changed tack in its approach toward China since the last RIMPAC. The 2018 National Defense Strategy, the first since President Donald Trump took office, singled China out as the ""revisionist power"" that poses ""the central challenge to US prosperity and security"".  But it is not China that is responsible for militarizing the South China Sea. Its deployment of limited military facilities and equipment in the South China Sea are of a scale necessary to safeguard its national interests and territorial integrity, and deter any attempts at secession by emboldened and cajoled Taiwan ""independence"" seekers.  Rather it is the pivot to the Asia-Pacific by the US that is to blame. The current administration has furthered this, using China's evolving defense posture and the territorial disputes it has with some of its neighbors as an excuse to increase its military presence in the region, invite its allies to do the same, and pocket some money from China's neighbors by playing up a ""China threat"" and then going door to door peddling its outdated weaponry.  However, while the sales pitch has proved enticing — and why not? Everyone likes new toys — the fact remains that it is all smoke and mirrors.  This is a unique period of strategic opportunity for China's development, and it is not in its interests to jeopardize regional peace and stability.  China's neighbors know this, and know that it is also not in their interests to do so. Which is why, despite the hawking by the US, they are negotiating with China on a code of conduct to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. The US should change its negative mindset and seek to do the same.         "
Shared commitment to uphold multilateralism: China Daily editorial,5/24/2018,"                          Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in Beijing, capital of China, May 24, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   As President Xi Jinping said on a visit to Germany last year, the development of China-Germany ties is ""a story of success"". And Angela Merkel's ongoing visit to China, her 11th as the German chancellor, once again highlighted that; showing that her country's relations with China stand out among those of Western countries.  While meeting Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Thursday, she suggested it was because the two sides have established confidence in their relations so that difficult questions can be raised.  And there have been tough questions raised over the years, on both sides. However, high-level exchange visits and dialogue mechanisms covering important areas in bilateral ties, including finance, security, people-to-people exchanges and diplomacy, have enabled the two sides to safely navigate the potential pitfalls and expand their common ground.  And in the face of the unilateralist advantages pursued by the US administration, which has been busy scrapping one multilateral international agreement after another, China and Germany are strengthening their close coordination.  On Thursday, Li and Merkel reaffirmed both countries are committed to upholding the Iran nuclear deal and free trade, both of which have been threatened by the actions of the United States.  Later, Merkel met with President Xi, and he said the G20 framework had already proved their cooperation was productive. He said the two countries should expand the breadth and depth of their cooperation, shoulder their responsibilities as major countries and set a good example for international cooperation, and work together to advance multilateralism and global governance.  He also urged Germany to be a leading force in strengthening China's relations with the European Union so that together China and the EU can speak with a clear, predictable and encouraging voice in international affairs. This would help inject greater confidence in multilateralism.  On Friday, Merkel travels to Shenzhen in South China, which has become the technology powerhouse of the country. Taking advantage of China's new round of opening-up to strengthen their cooperation in science and technology and innovation would not only make the cake bigger for themselves but also others, as the benefits would be felt all along the global production and trade chains.  By highlighting their shared commitment to multilateralism, the two countries have set a good example for the international community.         "
Realistic expectations for Kim-Trump summit needed: China Daily editorial,5/23/2018,"                          President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un are planned to meet on June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in said in Washington on Tuesday that ""the fate and the future"" of the Korean Peninsula hinges on US President Donald Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Certainly, a first ever face-to-face meeting between the incumbent leaders of the two countries would present a historic opportunity to finally end the standoff and tensions that have persisted for more than six decades.  Which is why talk from both sides that the meeting might not go ahead as planned has raised concerns.  Trump has said there is a ""substantial chance"" the summit won't happen as scheduled — saying it could be delayed or canceled if ""certain conditions"" are not met. And the DPRK has threatened to scrap the meeting after Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton said there could be a ""Libya-style solution"" to denuclearize the DPRK, something that did not end well for the Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi.  Given past practices, it is possible that both parties are just jockeying for position ahead of the talks. But it is to be hoped neither side puts a foot wrong in doing so.  The mutual suspicions that have festered over the years will not be dispelled in just a few months. And the history of agreements breaking down because of the lack of trust, means that the two sides' demands and expectations have to be realistic.  Trump said on Tuesday that he believes Kim is serious about denuclearization, and that in the short period of time his administration has been engaging with Pyongyang it has been a relationship that seems to be working. But he added, it remains to be seen how long it continues to work. For it to do so, Washington will need to deliver on its promises of security guarantees for Pyongyang, as this is fundamental to any progress.  With the US seemingly wanting swift denuclearization in one go, and the DPRK wanting it in phases, there is certainly the possibility there will be no meeting of ways.  But with Trump saying the two sides are still talking, and Pyongyang allowing reporters entry to cover the dismantling of the nuclear test site, the two sides clearly believe it is still on the cards.  All stakeholders have every reason to do all they can to ensure the meeting does go ahead, as it is a necessary step toward securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and finally laying this legacy of the Cold War to rest.

Battle against pollution now has pride of place: China Daily editorial,5/22/2018,"                          A border guard in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, inpects bundles of waste textiles smuggled into China.Mao Siqian Xinhua   The latest crackdown on waste shipments from overseas launched by the General Administration of Customs on Tuesday reflects the government's firm determination to prevent the continuous inflow of foreign waste in efforts to combat pollution.  Code-named Blue Sky 2018, the ongoing operation targets waste slag, metals and plastics that are being smuggled into the country to be used as raw materials. As much of the waste is hazardous and sold to unlicensed plants with no proper processing technology, it poses a serious threat to the environment and people's health.  It is the third time this year that a campaign has been launched against the smuggling and processing of illegal solid waste since the introduction of a ban on imports of 24 categories of solid waste from foreign countries that came into effect on Jan 1. Since then hundreds of people have been arrested.  Before the ban, China had been the world's largest dumping ground — taking in over half of the solid waste exported globally. And the huge profits involved, in tens of billions of US dollars, as well as lack of effective supervision and a well-regulated recycling system, mean it will be a long and tough fight to put an end to the illegal trade.  Improving the natural environment has been made one of the country's three priority tasks, and that means the tougher laws and regulations put in place to prevent pollution must be strictly enforced.  That also means companies can no longer pursue profits at any cost and local authorities will have to change their mindset. To combat pollution and clean up the air, rivers and land, the central authorities have shut down numerous polluting factories. Yet to support their economies, many local authorities turn a blind eye to the polluting enterprises.  Last month, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment named and shamed seven local governments for not doing enough to prevent solid waste pollution, requiring the local authorities to correct the problems, punish those responsible for the pollution and establish long-term mechanisms to address the issue.  As President Xi Jinping said at a tone-setting meeting on the ecology and the environment last week, the transition to green development will not be without pain. But, as he stressed, the country has to ""bite the bullet"".         "
Canberra should drop any anti-Beijing bias: China Daily editorial,5/22/2018,"                      After months of growing estrangement, there are positive signals that Australia is stepping up efforts to mend the fences with China. A refreshing change of attitude that Beijing has welcomed.  In a meeting with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers' conference in Argentina on Monday, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her country values its relations with China and sees China's development as an opportunity rather than a threat.  And last week, in the first visit to China by an Australian minister in eight months, Steven Ciobo, Australia's trade minister, visited Shanghai, saying he hoped to repair ties with Australia's largest trading partner.  These efforts to patch up ties were necessary because some members of the government chose to buy the claims that China was seeking political influence in Australia, and translated the media's claims into legislation.  It is such bias and distrust, which emerges on Canberra's part from time to time, that chokes the otherwise positive momentum of bilateral ties.  As Wang pointed it out in his meeting with Bishop, China constantly advocates no interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and it has no intention of trying to do so.  Canberra should know its suspicions — which have arisen because China follows a different development path — will only undermine the efforts the two countries have previously made to promote ties and cost them the opportunities that would be presented by greater cooperation.  There are some in Australia who regard the US alliance as an immutable foundation of Australian foreign policy, but that belief was forged in different times. Canberra should not give in to habit and simply follow Washington's lead with its foreign policy. It should bear in mind that in recent years, each time China-Australia ties have taken a turn for the worse, the United States has been a factor.  Canberra should align itself with the region and work with Beijing to advance the regional trade agreement that has long been in the works.  China values a good relationship with Australia, and there is no fundamental disagreement pushing Beijing and Canberra apart. The differences that do exist can be bridged through talks.  Canberra should shake itself free of the past and work with Beijing to realize the promising potential of bilateral cooperation.         "
US' blame game part of its containment strategy: China Daily editorial,5/21/2018,"                          An H-6K bomber during an exercise. [Photo/Xinhua]   Bombers of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force conducted takeoff and landing training from an islet in the South China Sea in order to improve the ability to “reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions”, as the air force said in a statement.  The exercise involved several H-6K bombers taking off from an air base on Yongxing, the largest of the Xisha Islands, and simulating strikes against sea targets, the Pentagon claimed.  The United States, of course, wasted no time in expressing how concerned it was by this. The Pentagon called it a continuation of China’s militarization of the waters, which it claimed was raising tensions and destabilizing the region.  Which was only to be expected. Despite its seemingly nonstop naval exercises in the region — whether in the East China or South China seas, or the Indian Ocean — it cries an alarm every time China conducts any military training drills.  In this Washington knows no shame. It continually tries to lay the blame for militarizing the waters on China’s doorstep, despite knowing full well that it is the one that has been doing that.  Under the pretext of safeguarding freedom of navigation for commercial shipping, it has sent a large number of warships to the region in a bid to intimidate and constrain China and guarantee continued freedom of movement for its navy.  Given its need to protect its trade and energy supplies, and its expanding interests overseas, China can no longer endure the restrictions that the threat of force imposed on it in the past. It has had to strengthen the navy’s capabilities to ensure that it is fit for the times and can fulfill its duty to protect the nation’s territorial integrity, trade and growing interests overseas.  To try and draw attention from its aggressive stance, the US continually seeks to portray China as a threat to others in the region, hoping to take advantage of the territorial disputes in the waters to drive a wedge between China and its neighbors and encourage the latter to side with it. However, China’s neighbors, while not wishing to upset Washington, have shown they are reluctant to get roped in to its geopolitical competition with China.  What is incontrovertible is the tensions in the region keep abating until the US stirs them up again. It is its desire to contain China that is destabilizing and militarizing the waters.         "
Trump's disrespect for deals shows US' disregard for others: China Daily editorial,5/20/2018,"                                                 File photo shows US President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement after signing it in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, US, May 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   There is no telling yet how the United States will benefit from pulling itself out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But what is clear is its withdrawal has led to greater political instability in the Middle East and more uncertainty in international relations.  Even its traditional allies, the major European countries such as Britain, Germany and France, are at odds with the United States, declaring that they will stay with the deal, as they believe that Iran has abided by the agreement. This has been attested to by UN weapons inspectors.  What is worrisome is the fact that Trump pulled his country out of the deal not because he knew with certainty or even believed that Iran had failed to abide by the agreement, but because his predecessor Barack Obama signed the deal. He abandoned the Paris climate deal for the same reason.  The Trump administration has shown no concern for the interests of other countries and for the consequences of its unilateral actions.  The hostility between Iran and Israel has been severely aggravated by the US’ exit from the deal. Iran’s forces based in Syria launched missile attacks against Israel, which has retaliated by striking Iran’s logistics bases in Syria in recent days. It is likely that the chaos in the Middle East will worsen because of the US’ unilateral actions.  The US re-imposing sanctions against Iran will also further estrange its relations with its traditional allies as the European Union has been doing whatever it can to protect European companies doing business with Iran from being penalized by the US. The EU is reviving legislation to circumvent the sanctions. It is also allowing the EU’s Investment Bank to lend to EU projects in Iran, urging EU governments to explore “one-off” transfers to Iran central bank to help authorities to receive their oil-related revenues. The EU will also continue its assistance to Iran.  There is no doubt that companies from other countries doing business with Iran will suffer from the US sanctions if they fail to give up such business deals or unless they get a waiver from the US, which seems almost impossible.  Is this the way the US is contributing its bit to the world peace and the development of the world economy?         "

Tsai should not hijack the WHA issue for political end: China Daily editorial,5/17/2018,"                      This year’s World Health Assembly will be held in Geneva from May 21 to 26. And for the second year running, Taiwan will not attend.  As the World Health Organization confirmed on Tuesday, the previous invitations extended to the island from 2009 to 2016 were a special arrangement based on a cross-Straits understanding that allowed the island to attend as an observer.  But this arrangement was based on the island’s previous administration upholding the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China.  This essential foundation for the arrangement is now nonexistent thanks to Tsai Ing-wen and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party’s refusal to acknowledge the consensus.  That is the reason for the island’s nonattendance at this year’s WHA, and the Tsai administration should shoulder the blame.  But like it did last year, the current administration on the island has again tried to play up a sense of victimhood, claiming that its exclusion from the WHA puts the island’s 23 million residents’ health at risk.  But as WHO has clarified previously, experts from the island regularly attend WHO technical meetings and it is in contact with the island’s health authority.  In fact, it is the Tsai administration that is hijacking public health on the island to serve its political end. It hopes that by playing on the heartstrings of the international community, it will be able to nudge its way into the WHA.  And the reason why the island wants to worm its way into the WHA is so it can claim it has the status of an independent nation. As the main meeting of the World Health Organization, an affiliated agency of the United Nations, WHA participation requires statehood.  The DPP persists in trying such tricks, because it knows the mainland has the firm will and sufficient capabilities to block any moves they might make toward formal independence. However, such ruses are both foolish and futile.  The Tsai administration should reflect on the island's absence from the WHA again this year, and recognize that the only way for the island to expand its international space is to recognize the one-China principle, the cornerstone of cross-Straits relations.

Give and take winning proposition in trade talks: China Daily editorial,5/17/2018,"                      With US President Donald Trump tweeting that there has been no folding, and Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng saying that China is prepared for the possibility of an escalation of their trade disputes, both sides set out their respective positions for their trade talks in Washington.  In doing so doused hopes that the two sides will be able to resolve their differences during their second round of talks.  However, it is still possible to take the view that the glass is half full. Although it is proving difficult to reach a mutually satisfactory solution, the fact that the two sides are still willing to talk indicates neither considers it an impossibility.  Both sides know it is in their own interests to find a solution, as a trade war would be damaging to both economies.  Indeed, the two sides reached a consensus on some basic principles for dealing with the dispute in their Beijing talks earlier this month. That they failed to hammer out concrete plans to act on it was because the United States made unrealistic demands of China.  Which is why Trump’s tweet has been viewed as cause for pessimism. Although, the two sides are involved in a high-stakes game, it is not one where winner takes all. If that is the attitude the US has taken into the current negotiations and insists on, then the odds on reaching an agreement are going to be extremely long.  When speaking with former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and some US lawmakers on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s special envoy Vice-Premier Liu He, who is heading the Chinese delegation, said China is actively exploring ways to reach a proper settlement of the two countries’ trade issues.  If the US demonstrates the same willingness to solve the problems that exist, and it is realistic about what it can gain, there is no reason why a solution to the ongoing trade frictions cannot be found.  China and the US have been able to overcome their difficulties in the past. And they can do so this time if they each handle the other’s concerns with respect and are willing to take concrete actions to address them.  But to strike a bargain, Washington should lower the price it is demanding. Beijing cannot do things beyond its capabilities.  This is a chance for the two sides to adjust their trade relations to the benefit of both. Fortune will favor them both better if they are not at odds with one another.  Both will be winners if they strike a deal.         "
Is Australia ready to let go of its ideological bias?: China Daily editorial,5/16/2018,"                      With the robust growth of China-Australia trade and China’s rising influence in the world arena, Australia’s dilemma of how to balance relations with its longtime ally the United States and its important economic partner China has become increasingly acute. In a recent article published in the Australian Financial Review newspaper, former Australian ambassador to China Geoff Raby criticized Australia’s current foreign policy toward China and called for Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to be replaced, claiming that Canberra’s relations with Beijing would not improve until she was removed. Bishop defended herself by saying she was out of touch with the current state of the relationship, which she described as “good and strong”. As if to prove the truth of her words, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday on a trip which he said is intended to reinforce ties with his country’s largest trading partner. Yet the fact that some former high-ranking Australian officials, including Raby and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, have expressed concerns and worries on the current undesirable status of China-Australia ties does point to the fact that the broader picture of bilateral relations is not as rosy as Bishop tried to paint. Even though she did admit that the two countries disagreed from time to time. However, what her words ignore is the noticeable rise in Australian media’s anti-China rhetoric and the unwarranted accusations against China by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and members of his government. Earlier this year, for instance, Turnbull wrongly cited China as a reason behind Australia’s legislative intention to ban foreign interference in its politics. As such, it is Australia that has an outdated view of China. Raby was right when he pointed out in an article last month that Canberra is ideologically preconditioned to operate in the US-led system. This means it is finding it hard to adapt to the changing regional realities. If Canberra continues to wish for the return of US leadership in the Asia-Pacific and refuses to face the reality of China-Australia ties, it will hit a stone wall. It is to be hoped that Ciobo’s comment that he wants to ensure the relationship with China is afforded the priority it deserves means that Canberra is ready to put its bias behind it.         "
Goodwill of all is crucial for peninsula peace: China Daily editorial,5/16/2018,"                      The easing of tensions that has completely changed the picture on the Korean Peninsula has been hard won. It should not be taken for granted. The good progress that has been made in getting the two sides talking has necessitated a softening of their previously bellicose stances. However, the rapport that has been forged is extremely vulnerable given the mistrust and suspicion that has festered over the years. Yet this is a historic moment when the antagonism and mistrust fomented during the Cold War may finally be laid to rest. The possibility of direct talks between the leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States — the first since the armistice agreement put an end to hostilities 65 years ago — should be cherished, not squandered. Which is exactly what the US-ROK joint military exercises that began on Friday have risked doing. The drills are an annual event and no doubt require a degree of coordination and planning, but given the significance of the coming meeting between DPRK leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, they could surely have been canceled or postponed. In response, Pyongyang canceled high-level talks with Seoul hours before they were due to take place on Wednesday. It was entirely predictable that it would do so, given how much it dislikes the provocative military maneuvers that simulate attacks on it, and its past responses to them. These developments have poured cold water on the warming relations that were on display at the summit between Kim and his counterpart Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea on April 27, when the two Koreas agreed to complete denuclearization of the peninsula and the replacement of the current armistice agreement with a peace treaty. What is even more disturbing is Pyongyang’s statement immediately after that Kim may cancel his meeting with Trump if the US pressures Pyongyang to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons. It is all very well for the White House to say it is carrying on with preparations for the Singapore summit on June 12, as that makes it look like it is Pyongyang that is spoiling the party. However, unless Washington shows it is sincere about finally putting an end to the acrimony and animosity, the concerted efforts to nurture the precious potential for peace since the beginning of the year will not be rewarded. Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang need to treasure what has been achieved, increase their communication, and try to overcome the mistrust and suspicions that stand in the way of a historic breakthrough.

Foreign firms held to account: China Daily comment,5/15/2018,"                      As an increasing number of foreign enterprises are operating in China, there has been growing public scrutiny on those that fail to respect the country’s territorial integrity. Especially after the White House referred to the nation’s efforts to get foreign companies to stop referring to Taiwan and other regions as separate countries as “Orwellian nonsense”. So it was not surprising that people were outraged when a photo was posted on social media showing a T-shirt produced by a US clothing giant bearing a map supposedly of China, which omitted Taiwan and other territories. On Monday, the US clothing retailer Gap issued an apology on its official social media account in China, saying the company “respects the integrity of China’s sovereignty and territory” and it was “terribly sorry for this unintentional mistake”. Gap is just the latest foreign company to upset consumers in China. Foreign airlines and hotel chains have also felt the weight of public scorn for their casual redrawing of the map of China, although usually in a less graphic way. Just because something unreasonable was tolerated in the past does not mean that should always be the case. It is right for people to no longer turn a blind eye to practices that embolden secessionists and fuel their deluded ambitions. Any foreign multinationals doing business in China while violating its sovereignty principle should take the initiative to change their stance before the public’s attention is drawn to them. Otherwise, they will find there is a price to be paid, as Chinese consumers will turn their backs on them. Not cashing in on the Chinese market is a high price to pay for a practice that — as Gap’s apology shows — is most often habit rather than intent. The public’s refusal to continue to put up with the adventitious nibbling away of parts of the country is not political correctness. It is a long-delayed response to put a stop to what is an offensive practice. Meanwhile, those companies that show they respect China’s sovereignty will find that they are welcome in the country and will fare well.         "
US cannot shrug off its role in Palestinian deaths: China Daily editorial,5/15/2018,"                          Palestinians clash with Israeli troops near the Gaza-Israel border, east of Gaza City, on May 14, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   The plight of Palestinians once again attracted the world’s attention on Monday, but at a cost.  While cheering Israelis and Americans celebrated the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem, 50 miles away along the Gaza border there were Palestinian protests that sparked the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the 2014 Gaza War.  Israeli forces reportedly killed 59 Palestinians. And more than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas.  The Israeli tactic of using live fire against the protesters has sparked worldwide condemnation.  However, the White House response to the deaths of dozens of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli troops was to call the deaths “tragic” and lay the blame on Hamas, which had called for the protests.  The escalation of tensions was sparked by US President Donald Trump’s decision weeks ago to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. A move that has only served to pour oil on the fire of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Yet Trump seems proud of his mishandling of the most sensitive issue in the Israel-Palestine conflict, tweeting on the inauguration of the Jerusalem embassy — “A great day for Israel!”  And indeed it was, for it showed the US has discarded any pretense that it is playing the role of impartial mediator.  Trump’s signal that the US is backing Israel and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal have raised concerns that Israel and Iran are moving closer to war. On Thursday, the Israeli military said Iranian forces in Syria had fired rockets at its positions in the Golan Heights and it had responded with extensive strikes.  With the US’ actions aggravating the turmoil in the Middle East and risking the Israeli-Palestinian peace process going up in smoke, the international community should not sit idly by and do nothing.  China has already called for an end to the violence against civilians, and urged the international community to make coordinated efforts to support relevant UN resolutions.  These set out a two-state solution, with the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel with East Jerusalem as its capital.  That is the only way to ensure permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The US should accept that fact.         "
We-media's pursuit of profits does not mean anything goes: China Daily editorial,5/14/2018,"                              File photo of the victim Li. [Photo from the web]       Police announced on Saturday that a 21-year-old flight attendant who was killed on the evening of May 5 in Zhengzhou, Henan province, was murdered by the driver of the car she had hailed using the Didi Chuxing service and the man had killed himself by jumping into a nearby river.  While most people have expressed relief that the case was solved so quickly and many have criticized the car-hailing company for its response and the loopholes in its system that enabled the tragedy, there has also been anger at the way some public social media accounts have covered the tragedy.  In one extreme example, a WeChat account with more than 10 million followers released an article using obscene and indecent words and phrases to depict the incident, which aroused widespread condemnation as it was tantamount to hurting the victim a second time after her death.  Under public pressure, the owners of the account later apologized and announced it will be closed forever.  There are unprecedented opportunities to cash in on the huge social media audience and there are those who cross the line in their sensationalism in a bid to win eyeballs.  There are more than 20 million social media public accounts in China vying for followers each day with scoops or contents with eye-catching titles, and that number is rising each day. For such accounts, more views mean not only a boost to the account’s popularity, but also its ability to generate more revenue through advertisements.  Yet during the fierce competition, some have chosen to go too far in their pursuit of profits. They fail to conceive how painful their words are not only to those they depict with such casual disregard to normal sensitivities. They have forgotten that the desire to reach a wider audience is not a license for them to say whatever they like.  In this case, it was the public anger that has forced the wrongdoers to acknowledge their mistakes and correct them promptly. But in a society ruled by law, a better way has to be explored to ensure that the new media, together with the traditional media, act responsibly.         "
'America first' hobbles global leadership of US: China Daily editorial,5/14/2018,"                          A worker is seen inside the new US embassy compound during preparations for its opening ceremony, in Jerusalem, May 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Since Donald Trump took office in January, 2017, there has been much speculation about the direction of US policy in the Middle East. Now it has begun to take shape and it spells ill for the region.  With the US president announcing he was withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal last week, and the US opening its new embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, the ire in the region has grown.  If previous US governments tried hard to shore up the US image as an impartial mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — despite the long tradition of close US-Israeli ties — the pendulum of the current Trump administration has ultimately swung fully in favor of Israel.  Now that the divisions in the Middle East are deepening, Trump is looking to take advantage of these to fish for US interests in the region through its alliance with Israel.  A similar motivation prompted Trump to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, as he sees Teheran’s rising influence in regional affairs as an increasing threat to the US interests and influence in the region. Obviously, Trump’s new Middle East policy bears every hallmark of all his other actions, that is undoing whatever his predecessor did and putting America first, never mind the consequences for others.  However, Trump may have underestimated the sensitivity of the Jerusalem issue. History shows Jerusalem is one of a few issues that can rally all Muslim countries against the US despite their differences and disputes.  By unilaterally changing the status quo of the Jerusalem issue, the Trump administration is further intensifying the enmity between the entire Muslim world and Israel and pushing the Palestinians and Israelis into another vicious circle of violence and bloodshed. In the worst-case scenario, as some have already warned, the US move could even lead to war.  Such unilateral policies, which have become the mainstay of the Trump administration’s foreign policy, undermine the very spirit of diplomacy, multilateralism and international cooperation. To some extent, Trump is pushing the US self-centeredness to the extreme — the devil take the rest.  From the Paris climate change pact to the Jerusalem issue and the Iran deal, Trump seems intent on proving the US is unable or unwilling to play a responsible and constructive role in world affairs.  If the US continues to shrug off the responsibilities of power and continues to pursue narrow-minded interests, it is only natural that more and more people will turn their backs on its leadership.

Better China-Japan ties shot in the arm for regional cooperation,5/14/2018,"                      ALTHOUGH IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Tokyo last week has brought the estranged relations between China and Japan back onto the right track, Li's visit, the first by a Chinese premier in eight years, was of practical importance in helping the two countries begin to rebuild their long lost mutual trust. Beijing Youth Daily comments: In his speech marking the 40th anniversary of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty, Li expressed his anticipation that the two countries will advance their cooperation by taking advantage of the the opportunity presented by the progress that has been made toward resolving the Korean Peninsula situation. The consensus reached at the summit of the three countries on advancing their economic cooperation paves the way to push forward their long-anticipated trilateral free trade agreement, which will also give a shot in the arm to efforts to promote the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. This is a different tune to that being sung by Washington, which is following a unilateralist score that has been building to a protectionist crescendo. The potential of the three Asian neighbor's cooperation and collaboration is huge, and it is this that will guarantee the sustainability and vitality of their cooperation. That the trade with each other only accounts for 20 percent of their foreign trade, and their capacity in cooperation on industries, environmental protection and energy saving, among other things, is yet to be tapped speaks volumes about the prospective benefits that could be realized through a trilateral free trade agreement. Also, the memorandums of understanding between China and Japan on strengthening their service trade and cooperation in third countries, which is closely related to the Belt and Road Initiative, and their agreements on the building of sea and air liaison mechanisms and restarting negotiations on a currency swap agreement all indicate the two neighbors have made the first strides toward greater economic cooperation. Now is the time to carry on the momentum and materialize these consensuses.                     "
Carrier's sea trials show navy 'stands up in the East': China Daily editorial,5/13/2018,"                          China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier set sail on its maiden sea trial on Sunday morning. [Photo by Hu Kaibing]   Although, as the navy said, the trial is only to test the reliability and capacity of its propulsion system, the maiden sea trials of China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier on Sunday morning stirred the emotions of many Chinese.  Since its doors were forced open from the outside by Western navies in the late 19th century, it has been a dream for China to have a strong navy, so that there will be no repeat of the gunboat diplomacy and seaborne humiliations of the past.  Although it is not the latest-generation carrier technology, ""Type 001A"", as the vessel is currently known, is endogenously designed and built. Expected to be commissioned by 2020, it embodies both China’s self-reliance, the industrial and technological progress it has made, and the degree to which its naval capabilities have progressed.  As President Xi Jinping said last month when conducting a review in the South China Sea, notable progress has been made in modernizing the country's navy. The new carrier reinforces his message that the Chinese navy has ""stood up in the East"" with a brand new image. However, it still has a long way to go.  But that does not mean, as the sniping of some would have people believe, that the carrier is intended as a means with which to grab overseas interests. Rather, it is a means to prevent China’s national interests from being encroached upon.  Although the Chinese navy has developed rapidly in both size and quality over the past five years, the abuse and menace that are regularly directed the country's way means it would be remiss for it not to have the means to urge caution.  Nor should the expanded role the navy is being asked to play be dismissed. As well as the inshore defense that has been its mission for decades and the safeguarding of the country’s territorial integrity, it also has to be able to protect the country's development interests including its trade routes and Chinese citizens working overseas.  As the world's second-largest economy, China is taking increasing responsibility for maintaining world peace and protecting the world economy. This also requires the country to have a strong navy, which will enable it to do whatever it can to respond to any humanitarian and rescue emergency.         "
"Mutual understanding, respect key to successful trade talks: China Daily editorial",5/13/2018,"                          A man walks down a road near the Deep-Water Port, an automated cargo wharf, in Shanghai, April 9, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   China and the United States have agreed to start fresh talks in Washington ""at an appropriate time"", which is a positive development to avert an all-out trade war. Now the two need to think thoroughly how to achieve more consensus in the talks to push forward the healthy development of bilateral trade relations.  The key principle the two sides have to abide by should be mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual benefits, which is in the interests of both countries and without which the talks risk being deadlocked.  The China-US trade differences have been brought to the brink of a dangerous trade war by Washington's unilateral actions, despite China repeatedly expressing its commitment to solving their disputes through dialogues. But since coercion has not worked, it has now softened its stance.  The US should draw lessons from its previous dealings with China. It should bear in mind that the outcomes of dialogue should be mutually beneficial and China will not accept its interests being damaged.  China, meanwhile, will continue to take a pragmatic approach to the talks and is willing to take measures to ensure progress is made in the dialogue to promote the healthy development of China-US trade relations, so long as its core interests are not jeopardized and the US respects the principle of equal-footed consultation in the talks.  China has always taken a constructive approach in opening up its economy to share with the international community its development opportunities. It has recently vowed to open up its multi-trillion-dollar financial sector, for example, and increase imports from other countries to contribute to global growth.  At a time when global growth is showing an initial trend of stable growth, but with its future sustainability remaining questionable, China's new opening-up moves will play a vital role in maintaining global growth and are in stark contrast with the ""America first"" approach adopted by Washington.  The Trump administration, ever since its inauguration, has shown an entrenched trend of protectionism, which has led to a series of offensive steps that risk ruining the existing global trade and economic order, triggering widespread concern over the destructive role of unilateralism.  Having suffered setbacks in dealing with China over trade issues after it threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese products worth $150 billion, the US should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China.  It should cast away its unilateral mentality so that the two sides can make efforts to find a solution to bilateral trade frictions.         "
Experts on China's first fully homegrown aircraft carrier,5/13/2018,"                          China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier set sail on its maiden sea trial on Sunday morning. [Photo by Hu Kaibing]   On Sunday, China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier set sail on its maiden sea trial. The new aircraft carrier is expected to be commissioned to the People's Liberation Army Navy.  Two experts shared their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.  Zhang Junshe, a senior researcher at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute  Compared with the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, the new aircraft carrier has improved quite a number of aspects. For example, its hull is not only totally designed by domestic engineers and designers, but also follows the latest design, which has made huge progress compared with that of the Liaoning, designed decades ago.  Besides, the hangar, the ship island as well as the ammunition lift of the new aircraft carrier have all been improved, and different sections of the ship, such as the radar system and the electronic system, merge better with each other. Thus it is not excessive to say the new aircraft carrier marks a giant step forward compared with the Liaoning.  However, that does not offer any support to claims of certain Western media outlets, who guess that an arms race is underway between China, Russia and the US with China owning its second aircraft carrier. There is only one reason for China to strengthen its naval power and that is self-defense — defense of its maritime boundaries as well as its overseas interests.  Besides, from the Opium War in 1840 to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China had suffered over 470 times from sea invasions by Western powers. For generations, a lesson has been carved in our hearts that China needs a strong navy to prevent such invasions.  Yang Yi, former director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at the People's Liberation Army National Defense University  China's second aircraft carrier will promote the fighting capability of the PLA Navy further than the Liaoning, because the Liaoning is more for scientific research purposes than for combat and training purposes.  Besides, the fact that China can independently design, manufacture and arm an aircraft carrier shows huge progress in the domestic military industrial capacity. Therefore, it is fair to call the new aircraft carrier a new starting point for China's development of its naval power. With ripe technologies in building an aircraft carrier independently, China will hopefully sharpen its technology in the future.  Some Western media outlets take China's second aircraft carrier as an opportunity to hype up the ""China threat theory"". China does not need two aircraft carriers, they claim. Actually, when the Liaoning started its first voyage, they said China did not need any aircraft carriers. Their purpose is to weaken the PLA Navy.  Their statement is ridiculous for anyone with the basic sense to believe. Just look at how many sea-based interests China has: defense of the maritime boundaries, peace and stability in the countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as keeping its maritime transportation lines open. One aircraft carrier fleet is obviously not enough for these.  Of course, China won't build a navy that exceeds its needs, either. China does not seek hegemony or control over the ocean. Therefore it won't build such a huge navy like the US. All these break the lies behind ""China threat theory"".         "
Nation learns lessons from rebuilding Wenchuan: China Daily editorial,5/10/2018,"                                             Ten years ago, on May 12, 2008, a devastating magnitude 8 earthquake hit Wenchuan county in Sichuan province. It killed nearly 70,000 people and left around 18,000 people missing. The disaster also left an indelible scar on the collective memory of the Chinese nation. As the country marks the 10th anniversary of the quake on Sunday, we can take pride in how the stricken areas have risen from the ruins, in the fortitude of those who survived the quake, and in the helping hands that have been offered and continue to be offered to help them rebuild their lives. Not least the huge amount of assistance in various forms provided by the central government and the governments of provinces and regions nationwide, which has helped the economies and disposable incomes of residents in the 39 counties and regions in Sichuan that were hardest hit by the quake expand more than threefold over the past decade. That is higher than the province’s average, according to official statistics. But while it is right to acknowledge what has been achieved in the post-disaster reconstruction efforts, we should bear in mind that the best way to commemorate the dead and missing is to make sure that the nation is better prepared for any natural disaster. To help ensure that is the case, an earthquake monitoring network is being set up in the seismically active regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in an effort to explore the possibility of earthquake prediction. The aim is to successfully predict earthquakes whose epicenters are less than 20 kilometers deep, as the closer to the surface an earthquake starts, the more ground shaking and potentially damaging it will be. Fittingly, the first of 2,000 planned monitoring stations was established in Wenchuan on Monday. Yet while we might one day be able to predict such cataclysmic quakes, it would be hubris in the extreme to believe that we can prevent or forewarn of every natural disaster that may befall us. And while Wenchuan has shown that new buildings, bridges and roads can be built, and economic activities revived, it has also shown how hard it can be for people to get over the psychological aftershocks. The fact that less than 10 percent of those who suffered psychological problems after the quake have sought counseling shows more attention should now be paid to this area.         "
Realistic expectations for Kim-Trump talks: China Daily editorial,5/10/2018,"                                                 A file photo of US President Donald Trump. [Photo/Agencies]   Everything appears to be rosy ahead of the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un.  Trump expressed his personal appreciation to Kim after three US citizens who had been detained by Pyongyang for anti-state activities were released on Wednesday. The DPRK’s official news agency, KCNA, reported that Kim had decided to grant amnesty to the three Americans at the “suggestion” of the US president.  The move came just hours after the government leaders of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea expressed their shared commitment to preserving and promoting the positive momentum on the Korean Peninsula at their long-postponed tripartite summit meeting in Tokyo. And it has been a while since they all agreed on something.  And it came the day after Kim made his second visit to China to meet with President Xi Jinping, just 40 days after his first visit, which was also his first trip outside his country since he became leader. During their cordial conversations in the northeastern coastal city of Dalian, Kim reiterated his willingness to denuclearize and his hopes that the upcoming summit with Trump would lead to lasting peace for his country and the Korean Peninsula.  History has hardly seen such broad-based support for substantive headway to be made in resolving the Korean Peninsula situation. With all the direct stakeholders enthusiastically engaged, it is becoming seemingly more possible by the day that the “historic meeting” Kim anticipates will produce what Trump hopes will be a “very successful deal”.  But it is that very desire that may prevent it from being realized. Anyone anticipating that “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” can be obtained with just a snap of the fingers, is probably destined to be disappointed.  That Pyongyang is actively promoting rapprochement, and has openly embraced the idea of ultimate denuclearization is indeed a very encouraging development. And, considering the shared interest in a negotiated outcome for the protracted crisis, the region may be closer than ever to untying what has long been a Gordian knot.  However, let us not ignore Kim’s statement that a successful summit with the US president will only be “a fine first step toward building a fine future”.  And given Washington’s apparent eagerness for immediate outcomes and Pyongyang’s preference for things to proceed in a step-by-step manner, a lot still needs to be straightened out in order to bridge what could be an unsurmountable gap.  Given the role it has been playing in facilitating the progress that has been achieved so far, Beijing can play a more active role in this respect by promoting a convergence of pragmatic expectations for the upcoming meeting.

Three neighbors give added impetus to regional progress: China Daily editorial,5/9/2018,"                                                 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (L), Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (C) and ROK President Moon Jae-in pose for photographers prior to their summit in Tokyo, Wednesday, May 9, 2018. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]   Although ties have been strained in recent times by their territorial and historical disputes, leaders of Japan, China and the Republic of Korea struck a more harmonious note in Tokyo on Wednesday.  Which is not surprising as the trilateral summit came hard on the heels of the positive progress that has been made in efforts to bring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in from the cold. And the efforts Beijing and Tokyo had been making to build on their shared interests to kick-start their stalled relations.  Indeed, when Premier Li Keqiang, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and ROK President Moon Jae-in sat down for talks, the portents for joint efforts to promote regional peace and stability and greater economic integration were the most promising they have been for years.  The fact that they reached a consensus on the need for complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the permanent establishment of peace shows that there is common ground to be found. And there is much the three neighboring countries could achieve if they could shelve their differences and work together. Certainly in trade, where a tripartite free trade agreement is long overdue.  For despite the fact that their combined markets account for more than 20 percent of the global gross domestic product, intra-regional trade among the three is only 20 percent of their total trade. Clearly there is much potential to be tapped.  And tapping that potential has become even more urgent in the face of the United States' protectionist stance on trade.  Reports that they have agreed to work toward finalizing an FTA and the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with Southeast Asian nations hopefully mark progress toward realizing what would give significant boosts to the regional economy.  However, as Premier Li said on Wednesday, China-Japan ties are at a crucial stage for improvement, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the signing of the bilateral treaty of peace and friendship. That opportunity should not be wasted. The two countries should uphold the principles of the four basic documents that form the foundation for better ties.  The meeting shows that where there is conviction and certainty in the goals to be achieved, the three countries can find words of shared resolve. Now the three should ensure their conduct is in accordance with their expressed intentions.         "
Trump again disregards international consensus: China Daily editorial,5/9/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement after signing it in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, US, May 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Despite the calls of the overwhelming majority of the international community for the United States to stay in the Iran nuclear deal, US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will withdraw the US from the pact and reimpose sanctions against Teheran. His decision is not only a blow to the agreement itself but also renounces the multilateral efforts that secured the compact.  In July 2015, after two years of tough negotiations, Iran and six world powers – Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the US, plus the European Union – reached a deal, in which Iran would freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the US and the EU lifting sanctions.  Since the deal went into effect on October 18, 2015, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, has confirmed ten times that Iran has fully complied with the obligations set out in the deal.  Trump withdrawing the US from the deal puts the multilateral deal in jeopardy, which in the worst-case scenario, as some have already warned, could lead to war with Iran.  However, Germany, France and the United Kingdom have all staunchly defended the deal, saying they are committed to it. That they are not willing to follow the US' lead this time offers hopes that the deal may survive without the US.  But whatever happens to the deal itself, Trump's move has immediately thrown US-Iran relations into confrontation again. Something that will not help to calm the turmoil in the Middle East. Especially, as the move seems intended to accelerate the force regime change in Teheran that Washington and its Middle East allies seem to be seeking.  It also sends the wrong message to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at a crucial moment.  This is not the first time that Trump has torn up a multilateral deal. From the Paris climate change pact to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, Trump’s “America First” doctrine has proved to mean the US will not be beholden to its promises.  While it is natural that the US leader should want to put his country's interests first, those interests do not exist in a vacuum. In today's interconnected world, the butterfly wings of even minor decisions can result in significant and unforeseen consequences elsewhere. And those in their turn also have their own butterfly effects.  Trump wants to improve the US' fortunes, which is all very well. But he is not a fortuneteller. Nor is anyone else in his administration. Not even whatever algorithms they might be using can predict every eventuality.  The deal was working; that much is known. It would have been much better to leave it alone.         "
Negotiating in good faith can stop trade war shots: China Daily editorial,5/8/2018,"                      That China and the United States are to have more trade talks is welcome news. That the two sides are to continue their discussions in Washington next week suggests they believe they can bridge their differences. And it is to be hoped that proves to be the case.  The fact that they are willing to continue to talk has raised hopes that some progress might have been made during their discussions in Beijing last week. Although the two sides failed to find solutions to their bilateral trade frictions, they seem, at least, to be no longer exchanging barbs.  If the two sides can continue to signal that they believe that continuing their discussions will come up with the goods, that would help to calm the widespread concerns a trade war is looming.  That the two parties have seemingly indicated that they prefer dialogue to resolve the issues has also hopefully put an end to them trading tariff threats.  Yet optimism still needs to be tempered. Although the US has shown a commitment to resolving the trade quarrel through talks, it is evident that it still holds the same view of China-US trade relations.  It still claims to be a victim of the big bilateral trade gap and demands that China take substantial steps to reduce its trade surplus. Seemingly, without offering much in exchange. And certainly not the high-tech products that would significantly shrink the trade gap, unless it is planning to make a backroom deal.  Now that the two sides have to make clear that a negotiated agreement remains on the cards, Washington really does have to get over its penchant for using national security as an excuse for blocking high-tech exports to China. And for also using that as an excuse to block Chinese investments in the US. It is these politically motivated practices that prevent the bilateral trade gap from narrowing.  Which is why, ahead of the Washington talks, China has urged the US to “engage in equal-footed consultation to resolve the differences and handle China-US trade frictions”.  It will be hard for the talks to fare well next week if the US stubbornly persists on wanting to take without giving. After all the talks should be all about bartering. A good haggle can be very satisfying if both parties walk away happy.  So in order to strike a bargain, both sides must be sincere about seeking to close the deal.         "
Xi's meeting with Kim boosts peace process: China Daily editorial,5/8/2018,"                          Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un hold talks in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, on May 7-8, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   There is no reason to doubt the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s sincerity in wanting to put an end to the long-standing hostility that has made it feel continually threatened. That enmity really should have been consigned to history a long time ago. However, past detentes were aborted due to perceptions on both sides that commitments were not being honored.  That should serve as a lesson that dedicated efforts are needed to remove mutual suspicions. And that for the current positive momentum to have the necessary firm foundations on which to build lasting peace, greater trust is crucial.  By meeting the need for an honest broker to help instill confidence that each side is acting in good faith, China has been playing and continues to play an indispensable role in the Korean Peninsula peace process.  Certainly the DPRK is not going to denuclearize unless it is convinced it has cast-iron and workable security guarantees. Nor are the United States and the Republic of Korea going to give such guarantees unless they are convinced that denuclearization is indeed taking place. Which will be a chicken and egg standoff, unless each side is satisfied the other will honor its step-by-step commitments.  China has been working hard to ensure the momentum that has been realized is consolidated. And that both sides sincerely cherish the possibility of putting their animosity behind them.  In the latest move, President Xi Jinping met with DPRK leader Kim Jong-un in the northeastern Chinese coastal city of Dalian on Tuesday. The DPRK’s state news agency KCNA said the meeting added important momentum to bilateral ties at a crucial time.  The two leaders’ meeting was unexpected as it came just 40 days after Kim had met with Xi in Beijing. But it comes ahead of Kim’s planned meeting with US President Donald Trump, which is expected to take place sometime this month, or next.  The friendly get-together enabled Kim to assure Xi that his country remains committed to denuclearization and has no need to possess nuclear weapons if there is an end to the hostile policies and security threats against it.  A message that Xi will no doubt pass on to US President Donald Trump, who later tweeted that he hopes he “will speak to my friend President Xi” by telephone on Tuesday evening, Beijing time, to discuss the DPRK situation and trade.  With Xi reaffirming to Kim that China will support the DPRK in its economic construction efforts now that it is switching its focus to development, the meeting marks another significant step forward for the Korean Peninsula peace process.

No stopping introduction of National Anthem Law: China Daily editorial,5/7/2018,"                                                 Hong Kong celebrates the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland with a flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square on July 1, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   The Hong Kong Federation of Students has become a pawn serving the whims of local separatists in recent years. Which is why its chairperson's show of ignorance on Saturday came as no surprise.  Expressing her hatred for the Chinese nation, Cheung Sin-ying said she feels sick every time she hears the National Anthem of the People's Republic of China. She made her remarks during the second of three scheduled hearings on the National Anthem Law by the Panel on Constitutional Affairs.  The Panel of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is collecting public opinions on the law.  It is not clear if the woman spoke for only herself or also on behalf of her organization. But whatever the case, there is no doubt she does not represent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents. Most of Hong Kong society upholds the SAR as an inalienable part of the PRC.  Which is why more people dismissed the woman's words with utter disgust on social media than supported her.  The Basic Law of the SAR stipulates in Annex III that the National Flag Law, the National Emblem Law and the National Anthem Law, among others, are national laws that must be implemented in the SAR through local legislation.  Local legislation on the National Flag Law and National Emblem Law has already been done. But the National Anthem Law was added to the list of national laws to be implemented through local legislation in Annex III of the Basic Law by the National People's Congress only last year. Now the local legislation on the National Anthem Law is underway.  The HKFS chairperson was allowed to speak at the public hearing on Saturday because she has the right to express her view on public affairs. But neither she nor her fellow separatists can stop the local legislation on the National Anthem Law. A draft bill is due to be presented to the Legislative Council by the end of July.  That is welcome news to most people in Hong Kong, who want the National Anthem local legislation completed as soon as possible. They recognize that its absence has allowed separatist advocates to trample over the collective interests of Hong Kong society multiple times in recent years.         "
Development synergies of China and ASEAN boosted: China Daily editorial,5/7/2018,"                                                 China's trade with countries along the route of the Belt and Road Initiative has grown significantly over the years, especially with the 10 ASEAN member countries. [Photo/VCG]   Premier Li Keqiang's ongoing visit to Indonesia is his first international trip after China's new Cabinet took office in March. It will help cement the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia. It will also contribute to the healthy development of China's ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  An important emerging economy and the largest among the ASEAN members, Indonesia has always held a special niche in China's peripheral diplomacy. As Li pointed out in an article published in The Jakarta Post on Saturday, there is strong synergy between the two countries' respective development initiatives. With China's 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and Indonesia's goal of being a global maritime fulcrum dovetailing nicely.  The efforts of the two countries to align their development strategies will no doubt increase mutual trust. This in turn will have a positive impact on China's relationship with ASEAN. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-ASEAN strategic partnership. The two sides are now drawing a blueprint for their common development and a shared future.  Despite the profound changes in the international and regional arenas, China-ASEAN relations have withstood the tests of the times. Two-way trade continues to bring real benefits to the two sides under the framework of China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. And frequent people-to-people exchanges are forging greater understanding.  Last year, China and ASEAN adopted the framework on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. This marks significant progress in the two sides' efforts to put the maritime disputes back on the track of dialogue and negotiations.  Thanks to their mutual efforts, the situation in the South China Sea has remarkably stabilized. The current positive trajectory of the South China Sea issues proves China and ASEAN are fully capable of handling the issues themselves.  The escalation of the maritime disputes in recent years shows outside interference in regional affairs should always be opposed. After all, regional development and stability cannot be endowed by others; it can only be achieved through the mutual efforts of countries in the region.  Developing a joint vision and pushing for greater synergy between their development strategies promises bright prospects for China-ASEAN relations. And, by forging robust cooperation in an all-around way, China and ASEAN can build a community of shared future in the region.         "
Referring to Taiwan as a country is a mistake: China Daily editorial,5/6/2018,"                          Photo shows a commemorative envelope themed on ""Chinese air force conducts island patrols around Taiwan"". The Chinese People's Liberation Army air force released a promotional video and commemorative envelopes, recapping its recent flights over China's island of Taiwan, on April 28, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   It is natural for the Civil Aviation Administration of China to require foreign airlines not to list the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan as though they are independent countries.  This may not seem to be a big deal to foreign airlines or hotel chains, who may wonder why they are being required to change their practice now. But when secessionists in Taiwan and Hong Kong are trying to split both regions from their motherland, the CAAC can no longer turn a blind eye to the errors of the airlines' ways.  Foreign airlines or hotels, whose listings may give the impression that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, are countries rather than regions, should amend the listings as it is important they abide by the laws and regulations of the country if they are doing business here. The same is also true of Chinese enterprises doing business overseas, which should abide by the laws of a country they are operating in.  As such, there is no need for any fuss about what the CAAC has required of foreign airlines and hotel chains. It is nothing but a reminder that they need to correct their mistake.  When the White House called the move ""Orwellian nonsense"" and said that the United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private companies to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content, it is simply trying to sensationalize the matter and putting its inflammatory two cents into something that does not concern it.  China did not and will never threaten and coerce US carriers and citizens as the White House claimed, the CAAC just informed the carriers that they got it wrong when they refer to China's regions as a country.  It is the White House that is engaging in some doublespeak by trying to claim this is China imposing its political views on US citizens, since it is the one trying to obscure the truth that these are all Chinese territories.  Referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as countries does have political implications for China, but what happens between the CAAC and foreign airlines is only a matter of how the latter should abide by China's relevant rules and respect the core interest of this country.  Really, there is no need for the White House to even get involved, neither is it necessary for it to associate it with the larger picture of China-US relations. Doing so only make an otherwise simple reminder much more complicated and adds to the complicatedness of the bilateral relations.         "
Trade talks tough but show way to solution: China Daily editorial,5/4/2018,"                      They agreed to establish a mechanism to work on ways to resolve their escalating trade disputes, even though China said it had “big differences” with the United States on some issues. This in itself should be seen as a positive development, as it shows both sides are willing to continue making efforts to resolve their trade frictions.  The two delegations, led by Vice-Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, agreed to work toward making more progress, a Xinhua News Agency report said, without providing details. The outcome is in line with the general expectation, because it is unrealistic to expect all trade-related problems between the world’s two largest economies to be solved in one round of talks.  The biggest achievement of the two-day talks that concluded on Friday is the constructive agreement between Beijing and Washington to keep discussing contentious trade issues, instead of continuing the two-way barrage of tariffs, which pretty much brought the two countries to the brink of a trade war. Needless to say, the Trump administration initiated the tariff war — the latest being its announcement to impose tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods.  This is all the more reason why the softening tone at the two-day meeting is welcome: it creates room for future discussion and negotiation between the two sides so they can find more common ground and work out a plan based on mutual respect and mutual benefit.  The US administration believes the additional tariffs on Chinese imports will help reduce its trade deficit with China. What it has ignored is the fact that there is no one reason for the deficit.  The deficit is closely related to the US’ industrial transformation over the past decades and its shift to a financial and tertiary industry-based development pattern, a problem that was already evident before China became a significant trade partner of it in the 1980s. As such, the deficit can be reduced only gradually, not through unilateral, ill-thought-through trade actions against China.  Making China a scapegoat for the ills of the US economy may appease some uninformed voters, but it would hardly reduce the trade deficit.  The developments over the past months show China will not compromise on its core interests no matter how desperately the US tries. What the US should and can do is to respect China’s economic sovereignty and engage in consultations on an equal footing to seek a mutually acceptable solution.  Of course, given the great benefits of four decades of reform and opening-up, China will further open up its economy so the international community can benefit from its large and fast-developing market. But China will do so on its own conditions, not to suit the agenda of other countries.         "
Marx even more relevant in today's changing world,5/4/2018,"                      Chinese people hold Karl Marx in the highest esteem, much higher than any other Western philosopher. Why? Because Marx’s theories have guided the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to liberate the country and achieve social modernization in less than a century.  Since 1949, the People’s Republic of China has traveled the path of social, economic and political development illuminated by Marxism, to transform from a war-torn, semi-feudal and semi-colonial country to an independent and relatively prosperous nation whose people are the masters of their own destiny.  The essence of Marx’s philosophy is the vision of a new, higher social order, which maintains and raises to a higher degree the spiral of productivity, which in a capitalist system encounters hurdles and negations, and is thwarted by socially and economically destructive crises.  That Marxism has remained the guiding philosophy for the Party throughout these years was evident in the grand gathering in Beijing on Friday to observe the 200th anniversary of the birth of Marx.  And the fact that Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said that to learn Marx, we should study and practice Marxist thought on productivity and the relations of production shows Marx remains significant in today’s China.  Accentuating the relevance of Marx, Xi also called for the study and practice of Marxist ideas on Party building.  The Party lays emphasis on Marxism because its philosophy of dialectical materialism makes it adaptable to China’s changing conditions. And it’s the pragmatic application of Marx’s theory that has transformed the Party from a group of 12 delegates to its first national congress in 1921 to the largest party in the world with 89 million members.  With different generations of Chinese leaders contributing to the Marxist theory, the Party has been developing Marxism according to the practical needs of the country during different stages of development. Socialism with Chinese characteristics, which China adheres to, is just one outcome of the application of Marxism to China’s actual conditions.  Xi has given a call to all Party members to venture on the path prescribed by Marx and constantly develop Marxism so it remains at “the frontier of the times”.         "
Sincerity is the best way to make talks worthwhile,5/4/2018,"                          Container area of the Yangshan Deepwater Port, part of Shanghai Free Trade Zone. [Photo/VCG]    Senior Chinese and US officials are talking in Beijing to try and defuse the tensions that have been threatening to drag the world's two largest economies into a trade war. Which shows how little either side would welcome that scenario.  Although it is natural that Beijing and Washington should have differences on trade, that they have been squaring up ready to exchange blows shows how niggly those differences have become. And how difficult it will be for the two sides to walk away happy.  But that is not to say such an outcome is impossible. Trade by its very nature is not a case of winner takes all. Acceptable agreements can be reached if both sides have realistic expectations of their give and take.  US President Donald Trump, who was talking hardball ahead of the discussions, offered a welcome change of tone on Wednesday, expressing his goodwill for the talks, and saying he looked forward to maintaining good relations with China. ""We will always have a good (great) relationship,"" he said in a tweet.  But to what extent the two countries are willing to accommodate each other's demands may well be the test of that.  And while the two sides are conversing to forestall the impending confrontation, fingers will be crossed in other countries that they are able to do so. For it is widely believed that failure would herald a slugfest of tariffs that would leave global trade reeling - not an appealing proposition at the best of times. And certainly not when the global economy is still recovering from the blows it received during the global financial crisis.  So all in all, a deal would be good for everyone, including the United States, something the members of the visiting delegation might like to bear in mind.  But even if the two sides do not strike a deal, and they merely agree to carry on talking, we ought to consider that a positive outcome. At least it would kindle the belief that a satisfactory arrangement can still be negotiated.  But they need to find some common ground if they are to get their relations back on track. The worry is that if they fail to do so, they will banish from their minds all thoughts of reconciliation.  Therefore, let us hope that the US delegation has come with the willingness to talk sincerely rather than with the design to cause injury.            "
Indispensable support for peninsula peace process,5/4/2018,"                      The United States is checking reports that three US detainees the previous administration tried hard to bring home, have been relocated from a labor camp to a hotel in Pyongyang, seemingly ready for release. This would suggest the planned summit between Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump is proceeding smoothly. Which hopefully will continue to be the case. Not least, because it will put the issue of denuclearization on the table. And what needs to be done to achieve that. At their potentially epoch-making meeting in the border village of Panmunjom last month, Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in and Kim confirmed that their common goals include a peace treaty and the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And Trump has said that he will not deem his meeting with Kim a success without a serious commitment to denuclearization on Kim's part. So it seems that everybody could be on a similar wavelength at last. And yet ... Considering the past flip-flops on the matter, any denuclearization agreement will require a mutually agreed road map and timetable for both sides to honor their commitments if it is to be both credible and workable. This is the ultimate test that may make or break the latest attempt to maneuver lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. And this is where China has an indispensable role to play. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Pyongyang, which culminated in a meeting with Kim, was important as it came as the discourse is beginning to shift to that potential stumbling block. Beijing has demonstrated a continuous commitment to playing a constructive role in brokering a multilateral consensus on denuclearization. And its emphasis on properly addressing Pyongyang's security concerns focuses on perhaps the only way to bridge the gap between competing requests. President Xi Jinping assured Kim during the latter's visit to Beijing in March that China is committed to developing the traditional friendly relations between the two countries. There is no reason why China should give less than full support to the upcoming talks between Kim and Trump and the improvement of inter-Korean relations. It is undeniable that positive changes have taken place on the Korean Peninsula, and with Kim saying Pyongyang is now willing to concentrate on economic construction, it's time to finally put out the slow-burning fuse.

Visit can help promote positive regional trends: China Daily editorial,5/2/2018,"                          Wang Yi, the Foreign Minister of China, addresses at a seminar of the relationships among China, Japan and Republic of Korea held in Beijing on Oct 25, 2015. [Photo/VCG]   A desirable rapprochement between Beijing and Tokyo will not only benefit the two neighbors, but also contribute to the good momentum that has emerged in Northeast Asia of late.  So Premier Li Keqiang's upcoming visit to Japan is a welcome sign that the two countries are actively trying to revive their relations.  Li is scheduled to pay an official visit to Japan from May 8 to 11. Given that this will be the first visit by a Chinese premier to Japan in seven years, it will no doubt help break the ice between the two neighbors and contribute to the two sides' efforts to reanimate their relations.  Relations between the two countries have been in suspended animation for most of the past seven years since conservative forces in Japan ""nationalized"" some of islands to which both countries claim sovereignty in the East China Sea. The temperature plummeting further because of their unrepentant attitude toward Japan's history of aggression and the reopening of old wounds.  It is fanciful to believe the two neighbors will be able to breathe new life into their relationship in an instant. But Beijing and Tokyo can seize the opportunity of Li's visit to bridge their differences and maintain the promising momentum that has emerged.  Li is also due to attend the seventh Japan-China-Republic of Korea Trilateral Summit Meeting during his visit. The resumption of the trilateral summit after three years shows the three neighbors have a shared will to deepen their cooperation within the trilateral framework.  With their economies accounting for one-fifth of the global economy and 70 percent of the Asian economy, the three countries are positioned to promote regional and global growth by tapping the potential of deeper cooperation in trade, investment and other fields.  The resumption of the stalled China-Japan-ROK cooperation would also accord with the current encouraging developments on the Korean Peninsula, where the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the ROK have just concluded a historic meeting that signaled a dramatic reconciliation between the two neighbors as well as a hard-won opportunity for stakeholders to push for denuclearization of the peninsula.  Under such circumstances, a détente in China-Japan ties and resumption of China-Japan-ROK cooperation will help propel the positive trends in the region and facilitate better communication and coordination to address other regional issues.

Art of a deal is when all parties are happy with it: China Daily editorial,5/2/2018,"                      If the high-profile trade negotiations between China and the United States, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, can produce positive outcomes, that would not only serve the interests of both countries but also benefit global trade and the world economy.  And there is no reason why the negotiations should be a damp squib if the US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is willing to discuss the bones of contention between Beijing and Washington with the genuine intent to listen as well as talk.  Turning a deaf ear to China's side of the story will mean the delegation returns home empty handed, the tit-for-tat tariff proposals become a reality, and the whole world, including the US, feels the subsequent pain.  China wants the talks to produce feasible solutions to put an end to the ongoing feud and the US' unfair trade practices.  And it is not alone in wanting this. The US' unilateral and protectionist moves have created worldwide uncertainty and met opposition from an increasing number of countries.  The European Union, for instance, has said bilateral trade with the US should be ""balanced and mutually beneficial"", and stated it ""will not negotiate under threat"".  Nor will China. It will stand up to the US' bullying as necessary. And as a champion of globalization, free trade and multilateralism, it will have strong support from the international community.  China's resolve to fight trade protectionism is buttressed by the consensus in the country, among both its leaders and the public, that the achievements it has made over the last 40 years should not be jeopardized by an outside power seeking to take advantage of the country, as happened in the past.  But that is jumping the gun somewhat. There is no reason why the talks should prove disappointing if both sides engage in them with the desire to resolve their differences on trade and other issues. Tariffs, after all, are the means to an end. And that end is the compromises that will seal a deal.  Certainly China will engage in the talks in the right frame of mind. Its stance remains consistent: dialogue is the way to quell the fracas and it is willing to be reasonable, however, it will not give in to threats.  The US wants greater access to China's market, but it should not use trade actions as a battering ram to force China to open its doors. It is already in the process of opening them wider. And in doing so, it expects that action to be reciprocated and the US to open its market to Chinese investments and competition from Chinese enterprises.         "
Some give as well as take needed for talks trade-off,5/2/2018,"                      ""We're going to have very frank discussions"", US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a TV interview broadcast on Monday. Which is all well and good. But whether there will be any positive outcomes from the discussions in Beijing on Thursday and Friday will depend on whether the delegation he is heading comes to try and lay down the law to China or amicably find ways to resolve the trade feud that has erupted. Certainly, Mnuchin and the other members of the US trade delegation, which will reportedly include Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, trade adviser Peter Navarro and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, should not attribute China's lowering of its tariffs on some imports, such as automobiles and medicines, to the United States' targeting of its imports and investments. Such a misreading of China's actions would be detrimental to having heart-to-heart conversations to clear the air. The time when China could be forced to open its doors is long past, and Beijing is not opening them wider now simply to appease others. As President Xi Jinping highlighted at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan last month, further opening-up is necessary at this stage of China's development. Broadening market entry, strengthening intellectual property rights protection and lowering tariffs on cars are not moves intended to reduce the surplus with certain trade partners; if that is the case it is merely an added bonus. Instead, they are long-signaled moves to benefit the country and meet people's demands for greater choice. Data from the World Trade Organization show that China's imports have grown at a faster rate than not only the world average, but also that of the US, Germany and Japan. In the coming five years, it is estimated China will import goods and services worth more than $10 trillion. That will be a big boost for those countries exporting to China, and to world trade as a whole given the global supply chains. It is not unreasonable for China to seek quid pro quo, to want protection for China's intellectual property rights and for developed countries to remove their restrictions on ordinary high-tech exports to China. If the US delegation comes to China believing Beijing's resolve to open wider to the outside world is a matter of expediency under pressure from Washington, it will likely mean a lot of time is wasted setting the record straight. Time that would be better spent putting an end to the current quarrel and exploring ways to put bilateral trade ties on a sound footing for the future.         "
Shrinking space for secessionists' tricks,5/2/2018,"                          State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas Maldonado seal the deal they just signed on Tuesday on diplomatic relations at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. WANG ZHUANGFEI / CHINA DAILY   The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Dominican Republic and the People's Republic of China was only a matter of time.  Trade between the two countries has been growing year by year, and according to the government of the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean island's trade with the PRC has reached $2 billion a year. The PRC is the Dominican Republic's second-biggest supplier of imports, and the island is the second-largest trading partner for the PRC among all the Caribbean and Central American nations.  And now that diplomatic relations have been established, the two countries will undoubtedly boost their trade further and expand their cooperation into other areas such as tourism.  The Dominican Republic's recognition that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of the whole of China was marked at a ceremony held in Beijing on Tuesday.  Behind the Caribbean country's severing of ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan is the reality that the one-China principle and the acknowledgment that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China is the consensus of nearly all the international community. It shows that no matter how hard the Taiwan authorities try to maintain the island's ""international space"", their efforts to secure recognition of the island as an ""independent country"" are doomed to failure.  The establishing of diplomatic relations between the PRC and the Dominican Republic will not only inject fresh vigor into their trade relations and facilitate China's investment in the island, it will also help promote China's economic ties with other countries in the Caribbean and beyond.  In this increasingly globalized world, China's Belt and Road Initiative is meant to develop economic cooperation with countries on an equal footing, so that both China and the countries it is cooperating with benefit. It has been welcomed in many countries as a way to develop economic connectivity and cooperation with the world's second-largest economy.  The Dominican Republic's forging of diplomatic ties with the PRC serves as a harbinger for the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to extend across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean and Latin America.

'A new beginning of history' on the Korean Peninsula,4/27/2018,"                          ROK President Moon Jae-in (R) meets with top leader of the DPRK Kim Jong-un in the border village of Panmunjom on April, 27, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   In a historic step — literally — Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un walked into the Republic of Korea and met with ROK President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom truce village. The fact that Kim became the first DPRK leader to set foot on ROK soil since the armistice in the Korean War in 1953 will be etched in history irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the historical meeting between the two leaders.  The two sides had high expectations from the third inter-Korean summit and the first since 2007. And fittingly, the firm handshake between Kim and Moon, accompanied by the smiles on their faces, indicated “a new beginning of history”, as the DPRK leader called it later.  By pledging to work for the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, the two leaders laid to rest any doubts that the summit would fail to yield the desired results. The joint declaration pledged to restore peace on the peninsula by, among other things, pursuing phased arms reduction, ceasing hostile acts, transforming the fortified border into a peace zone, and seeking multilateral talks.  In fact, the joint declaration said: “The two leaders declare before our people of 80 million and the entire world there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and a new age of peace has begun.”  Equally important, the two leaders said they would work with China and the United States to “officially end” the Korean War this year and seek an agreement to establish “permanent” peace in its place.  Washington, in turn, said it is hopeful the Pyongyang-Seoul talks will succeed in restoring peace and prosperity for the two sides, and is preparing for the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim in a few weeks.  The consensus on denuclearization, if properly implemented, will not only end the hostilities between the two sides, but also usher in a new era of development on the peninsula.  It would be in the interest of all parties, therefore, to keep the positive momentum going, so that no untoward incident prevents permanent peace and prosperity from being restored not only on the peninsula but also in the region and beyond.

Candid talks for elevating China-India relations,4/27/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, April 27, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   The beauty of the “informal” summit between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan, Hubei province, is that it comes with no baggage, only expectations. It is free of the usual diplomatic frills, somewhat beyond the global media limelight.  And, if as expected, the “heart-to-heart” communication between the two leaders on Friday reflected their deepened mutual chemistry. Which, in turn, will be conducive to improving mutual trust between the neighbors and charting the course of long-term bilateral development.  There is no denying, however, that mutual suspicion is keeping the two countries from deepening cooperation and working together on regional and international issues, from fighting climate change to improving global governance. The border incident last summer was just one example of what mutual suspicion could lead to, reminding both sides of the disruptive potential of distrust.  Yet neither Beijing nor New Delhi calls the other an enemy, which means both expect bilateral ties to improve. Indeed, China and India are natural partners, and both realize they carry the hopes of the other developing countries to improve international relations, in order to make the world order more equitable.  As such, the Xi-Modi meeting reflects the two neighbors’ common aspiration to not only stabilize their troubled relationship but also caution disruptive powers it is difficult to drive a wedge between the two neighbors.  The idea behind the two leaders having multiple one-on-one discussions, with only their interpreters present, over two days, will truly mean “heart-to-heart” talks, so they can address each other’s concerns and lift bilateral ties to a higher level. It will also help them strengthen their stakes in global affairs, for which the two sides have to more closely coordinate their trade policies to aggressively promote free trade so as to neutralize the protectionist moves by some economies.  Modi, on his part, seems to acknowledge the fact that there is genuine value in “resetting” relations with China in terms of political and security interests, as he expects it to raise India’s both profile and stake in matters global.  The two-day meeting is of historic significance, as Modi said on Friday, to maintain strategic common interest and deepen mutual trust.  And as Xi emphasized, the summit opens a new chapter in bilateral relations, which shows the outside world the two neighbors are determined to continue their win-win partnership.  Given his signature emphasis on and personal involvement in “top-level design”, Xi certainly aims higher than just improving bilateral ties.         "
G7's censure of China based on bias not fact: China Daily editorial,4/26/2018,"                                             The foreign ministers of the G7 must have an ax to grind. They again pointed accusing fingers at China over the South China Sea and East China Sea and criticized the human rights situation in the country in a joint communiqué early this week. Yet it is not China that is escalating tensions and threatening to undermine stability and the rules-based order in the region. For that, accusing fingers would more justifiably point at the United States and Japan. It is the US, with its naval operations that convey the threat or use of force in the South China Sea, and Japan, with its unilateral move to nationalize the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, that are the true troublemakers. Were they not trying to sow discord between China and its neighbors, there is no reason why the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the High Representative of the European Union, should criticize China. If they were really concerned about world peace, they would instead condemn those countries which have circumvented the United Nations to launch military strikes against Syria. Such military actions are blatantly counter to the UN Charter and international laws. If they were sincere about promoting regional peace and stability and helping solve problems, they would criticize the world's sole superpower for sending its warships thousands of miles away to conduct so-called freedom of navigation operations in waters where there is no such problem at all. However, they have chosen to turn a blind eye to these, and to all that China has done to promote the settlement of the territorial disputes it has with some of its neighbors in the South China Sea, as well as China's emphasis on the importance of completing the ongoing negotiations for an effective code of conduct in the waters. As to its human rights situation, China has achieved a great deal in improving the lives of its people over the past several decades, and continues to do so. The G7 ministers should stop viewing the region through the prism of the past. It is their Cold War mentality rather than reality that is the benchmark they use to gauge what is happening around the world.         "
US' investment policies target China's tech drive: China Daily editorial,4/26/2018,"                                             The United States talks a good game about ""unfair"" trade practices. But the actions it has taken belie its words. On the one hand, it is demanding China open its market to US companies. On the other, it is creating obstacles for Chinese investments in the US that do not accord with the principle of fairness, equality and reciprocity that it says it is upholding. That it is unwilling to compete on a level playing field has been revealed once again by reports that the US Treasury is reportedly considering ways to set limits on Chinese investments in the country's high-tech fields by invoking an emergency powers law and bringing forward security review reforms for corporate acquisitions. For years Chinese companies have invested in the US, creating jobs and deepening relations between the world's two largest economies. Yet that mutually beneficial momentum has met strengthening headwinds due to the increasingly tougher regulatory environment encountered by Chinese enterprises with plans to invest in the US. To rationalize its increasingly unfriendly investment policies toward China, Washington is trying to give Beijing a bad name, accusing it of being a thief of intellectual property. But this accusation is both unfair and unfounded. According to Nicholas Lardy, a researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, China paid almost $30 billion, the fourth-largest amount worldwide, on licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technology last year, nearly a four-fold increase over the last decade. Meanwhile, the idea that China can only imitate not innovate has been passé for a while. To suggest that it can only acquire technology through forced technology transfers is to be stuck in the past. China's total spending on research and development is estimated to have hit 1.76 trillion yuan ($279 billion) last year, a year-on-year increase of 14 percent. It is now the world's second-largest spender on research and development after the US. According to the US' National Science Foundation, it is expected to take the lead within the next five to 10 years. And China has and is incentivizing the commercialization of R&D breakthroughs. Last year, it outlined a plan to build a National Technology Transfer System by 2025 that will promote scientific and technological achievements and the realization of their economic value. Which points to the real reason the US is coming up with more and more excuses to target Chinese investments and major tech companies. They are aimed at throttling China's plan to transform itself into a global technology power. The Made in China 2025 strategy, which covers high-tech industries from telecommunications to robotics, has obviously worried Washington that its cheese is being moved.         "
US should continue to honor the deal with Iran: China Daily editorial,4/25/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron as they arrive at the White House in Washington, April 23, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The clock is ticking, counting down the seconds until May 12, the day when US President Donald Trump will decide whether to renew his waiver or restore his country's economic sanctions against Iran.  The day when the Iranian nuclear deal will be put under the severest test it has faced since it was agreed upon three years ago.  Trump has long made it clear he considers the multilateral deal a bad one. And he has repeatedly threatened to scrap it.  On Tuesday, despite visiting French President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to persuade Trump to stick to the deal, Trump again expressed his dissatisfaction, calling the deal ""insane"".  He, and those opposed to the deal, claim it merely delays Iran becoming a nuclear power, and it does not address Teheran's rising influence in the Middle East or its ballistic missile program.  Yet only a few of Iran's adversaries in the Middle East share a similar view that it should be scrapped. The majority of the international community still supports and recognizes the deal as a good one, seeing it as the best way to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  And, as an international deal reached between Iran and six world major powers, namely China, France, Russia, Britain, the United States and Germany, plus the European Union, the accord is a political asset of the international community, the US should not try to single-handedly ruin it.  While no party was particularly happy with the deal, it is a hard-won deal based on the compromises that each side was willing to make.  As EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Wednesday, ""there is one deal existing, it is working. It needs to be preserved"".  China and Russia have reaffirmed their support for the deal, calling for its comprehensive and effective implementation.  France and the United Kingdom, which joined the US in its unjustified military strikes in Syria, should stand firm and not let Trump recklessly sabotage the deal.  Not renewing the waiver would also send the wrong signal to Democratic People's Republic of Korea ahead of the planned talks between its leader Kim Jong-un and Trump, which the latter hopes will lead to Pyongyang renouncing nuclear weapons.  Trump should refrain from making any move which might cast a shadow over the current desirable trend in efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and not squander the international efforts that defused the Iranian nuclear standoff.

"Talks are well and good, but actions speak louder: China Daily editorial",4/25/2018,"                                                 A file photo of US President Donald Trump. [Photo/Agencies]   After weeks of escalating tensions in the trade spat between the world's two largest economies, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to China for talks. There is ""a very good chance"" of making a deal, he predicted.  Let's hope that optimism is not unfounded. That the torrent of words contains at least a trickle of changed intent. For although this may signal a respite in the tit-for-tat tariff announcements, unless the substantive discussions the two countries had last week have given him cause for confidence, his words alone do not suffice to dispel concerns that there is a trade war on the horizon.  Beijing has said it welcomes Mnuchin's proposed visit. But there is no reason for it to relax its vigilance. Especially as both Trump and Mnuchin have implied that it was Washington's actions that have pressured Beijing into promising further opening-up.  Taking Beijing's newly announced opening-up policies as a sign it is yielding to Washington's pressure would be to misinterpret its long-planned and long-prepared moves and only dash any hopes of positive outcomes from the talks.  Before embarking on his misguided course of action, Trump casually dismissed claims that his protectionist moves would have any blowback on the US economy, confidently quipping ""trade wars are easy to win"". The opposition at home to his administration's protectionist moves highlights his bravado was not based on reality.  Likewise, his moves have fomented anger among many of the US' other trade partners, who are rallying in opposition to an unjust cause. Although it is not siding with China, the European Union has stated that, under the framework of the World Trade Organization, it plans to join it in negotiations with the US on the tariff hikes imposed on imports of steel and aluminum.  It is hoped the US has seen the error of its ways and it is willing to follow a more reasonable course. But it would be hasty to anticipate a swift and easy end to the trade frictions. Particularly as Trump has an irritable bee in his bonnet about the US' trade deficits. It will likely take time to lubricate trade ties.  Nevertheless after all is said and done, hopefully something will be done as well as said to put an end to the uncertainties plaguing global trade. Healthy trade ties between the world’s two largest economies are beneficial to themselves, and the smooth running of the global economy as a whole.         "
"Continued improvement, reform and opening-up: China Daily editorial",4/24/2018,"                                                 Nightview of Sanya bay in Hainan province. [Photo/VCG]   At the Boao Forum for Asia earlier this month, President Xi Jinping said that each age and generation have their own challenges and missions, and although China has come a long way, there are still challenges that have to be overcome on the way ahead.  He stressed that the country needs to continue to improve itself through reform, take bold steps in innovation, continue to increase its openness and expand cooperation, and work together with the rest of the world to make a greater contribution to humanity.  The message from Monday's top Party meeting was the country is on the right course.  According to the statement released after a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, presided over by Xi, who is general secretary of CPC Central Committee, the major economic indicators show that economic restructuring is progressing well and progress is being made in winning the three tough battles of preventing major risks, targeted poverty alleviation and controlling pollution.  These three tasks are essential for the country's successful transition to high-quality development, which is the fundamental orientation for determining economic policies and macroeconomic regulation.  However, despite higher-than-expected GDP growth of 6.8 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, the statement cautioned that some ""structural"" and ""deep-level"" challenges remain. It urged coordinated measures be taken to safeguard the healthy development of the credit, equity, bond, forex and property markets, and supervision be stepped up to forestall risks.  The meeting also discussed the adverse international situation. This is becoming increasingly complicated with countries such as the United States opting for protectionism in the face of their economic challenges.  The consequent trade frictions between the two countries have been compounded by the high-tech competition between them hotting up.  The US action against ZTE has highlighted the need for China to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies, particularly US technology, and on Monday the Party's top leadership again called for the country to step up its efforts to achieve breakthroughs in the development of key technologies.  As Xi has previously said, the fact that core internet technology is controlled by others is the country's ""greatest hidden danger"".  But while the external environment might be difficult in some respects, that does not mean China is looking to close its door. As an unequivocal sign it is paying equal attention to ""bringing in"" and ""going global"", the Political Bureau called for the major opening-up measures previously decided on to be implemented ""as soon as possible"", and it promised further measures to open up the economy.

Hainan shows it may have learned its housing lesson: China Daily editorial,4/23/2018,"                          Nightview of Sanya bay in Hainan province. [Photo/VCG]   The latest restrictions on property purchases announced by the local authorities in Hainan province on Sunday are the toughest both nationwide and in the tropical island's own history.  The thresholds set for potential housing buyers are aimed at eliminating any speculation in the island's real estate market after it was announced Hainan would lead the next wave of opening-up.  Earlier this month while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the island being designated as a new province, the central government unveiled plans to build Hainan into a free-trade zone by 2020 and establish a free trade port there by 2025. This sparked a speculation craze that saw housing prices in Hainan skyrocket overnight despite the cooling policies already put in place.  Hainan has had painful lessons to learn from an overheated property market. A housing bubble that burst 25 years ago left many projects derelict all over the island, resulting in a huge number of nonperforming bank loans and leaving many investors penniless. It took years before Hainan could pick up its growth momentum.  The tough cooling measures to nip speculation in the bud are thus timely and necessary, and reflect Hainan's resolve not to rely on property any more for development.  The real estate market absorbs half of the investment in Hainan and accounts for half of its tax income. This does not fit the new role that Hainan is supposed to play as a pioneer of reform and opening-up in the new era.  That's why the local government has vowed to wean itself away from too much reliance on property and focus on sustainable development in such areas as tourism, modern services and high-tech industries in line with the blueprint charted by the central government.  The top leadership has emphasized that houses are for people to live in, not for speculation. The Hainan local government has made a correct decision in clamping down on the overheated housing market with cooling measures. The question now is how strictly will these measures be enforced.         "
Heart-to-heart talks can be new marker for ties: China Daily editorial,4/23/2018,"                      The global spotlight will be on the truce village of Panmunjom on the Korean Peninsula on Friday as the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Republic of Korea are holding their summit there. Yet another meeting in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, may be just as significant. The planned talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday and Saturday are described as being informal. But that has only served to raise expectations. It remains to be seen whether it will live up to its billing as an ""unprecedented meeting"" like the 1988 meeting between then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. This was when the two countries agreed to put their quarrels behind them. However, this has proved harder to do than say. Yet clearly both Beijing and New Delhi hope for something substantial from the upcoming two-day meeting, since the announcement was made on Sunday after talks between State Councilor Wang Yi and visiting Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. And there is good reason for optimism. The previous meeting between Xi and Modi took place in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen last September after the ninth BRICS summit, and it produced an end to the tense border standoff that had been souring relations for months. That incident was a reminder to the two proud neighbors that they must manage their border issues, or they will continue to trouble them. While third parties may profit from a deteriorating China-India relationship, the two countries themselves will not. They should be vigilant of others seeking to benefit at the expense of their friendly relations and recalibrate their relationship so it serves more constructive purposes. Last year's border altercation seems to have done just that, prompting both sides to reflect on the border issues and the importance of friendly relations within the bigger regional and global pictures. With the top diplomats of both countries highlighting the shared will to enhance strategic communication, boost mutual confidence, and upgrade their partnership both governments agreed to develop, there are hopes the coming meeting in Wuhan can usher in a new paradigm for bilateral interactions. Safeguarding economic globalization and regional security are just two of the many priorities they share. Historically, the two countries have generally got along well. They should be able to manage their differences and find a way to build on their historical friendship to realize the possibilities their common interests promise.         "
DPRK's decision must not be lightly dismissed: China Daily editorial,4/22/2018,"                          A DPRK flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva. [Photo/VCG]   The surprise announcement that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is suspending its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missiles tests is an auspicious prelude to leader Kim Jong-un's upcoming summit with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, and his planned talks with United States President Donald Trump.  Now there seems to be no reason why the two meetings should not go ahead and Pyongyang rewarded for its show of goodwill.  This may seem a step too far. But Kim was not acting on a whim. The decision came with a change in the country's national strategy. The focus is now on the economy.  A DPRK that is preoccupied with providing better lives for its people and proactively engaged in communication with neighboring countries and the broader international community will be a blessing to the region and the world at large. Both China and Russia have welcomed the announcement and urged the ROK and the US to act accordingly to promote a peaceful settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.  It is important to keep in mind this is a move awaiting a positive response. For what is intended to be kick-started by the talks will be a protracted process that could easily go awry.  Certainly skeptical observers have been quick to point out that suspending its weapons tests is not the same as renouncing them, and that it is not because his country is ready to abandon nuclear weapons that Kim has announced the suspension. Instead, those tests are no longer necessary since Pyongyang already has nuclear weapons, and it is believed the ""northern test site"" is no longer operable anyway.  So what Kim presented was perhaps more of an overture than anything substantial. While striking a conciliatory tone, Kim's pledges of no first use and no proliferation of nuclear weapons, also conveyed the message that Kim will sit down for talks as the leader of a legitimate nuclear power. Negotiations about actual nuclear disarmament will likely prove arduous given such weapons are critical to Pyongyang's sense of security. It will require ironclad security guarantees if it is to relinquish them.  Yet the DPRK's move does offer an opportunity to discuss a political settlement of the peninsula issue in his talks with first Moon, then Trump.  Trump tweeted: ""This is very good news for North Korea and the World — big progress! Look forward to our Summit."" The parties concerned now need to show the world that lasting peace and common development can be achieved through dialogue and consultation.         "
Meetings can strengthen cooperation consensus: China Daily editorial,4/19/2018,"                      The upcoming visits of high-ranking Indian officials to China present a good opportunity for the two countries to discuss the sensitive issues between them, deepen mutual trust and open up new horizons for cooperation on both bilateral and multilateral fronts. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Saturday for talks with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. She will also participate in the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Tuesday. The SCO’s defense ministers’ meeting is also being held next week, which Indian Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is due to attend. Both countries stand to gain by working closely together within the framework of the Eurasian intergovernmental organization, in which India is making its debut as a full member this year. Last year’s military standoff in Donglang border area showed that the two countries’ border disputes still cast a cloud over ties. Much needs to be done for the two neighbors to brush aside their mistrust, and frequent high-level dialogue is needed if the two neighbors are to dispel their mutual suspicions. The SCO meetings, culminating in the summit to be held in the Chinese city of Qingdao in June, provide a good opportunity for the two countries to build on the efforts both sides have made to improve their ties since then. And with Pakistan joining India as a full member of the SCO last year, there are hopes that the two countries will take advantage of the Shanghai spirit of friendship and cooperation that is embraced by the organization to improve their bilateral relations. This in turn would help overcome New Delhi’s wariness of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, and allow the new Silk Roads to better fulfill their intended role of “shrinking the distances” between countries, in terms of both infrastructure and people-to-people links. It would also increase the SCO’s relevance, both in the region and beyond, as it would enable the organization to better fulfill its goals of peace, security and stability in the region; and the establishment of a fairer economic order.

Don't let expectations for talks get carried away: China Daily editorial,4/19/2018,"                      White House has confirmed that CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with Democratic People's Republic of Korea's leader Kim Jong-un to discuss with him the planned summit with US President Donald Trump. Since Pompeo is Trump's trusted pick to head the State Department, the meeting is an assuring sign that both parties are serious about making the summit happen. And if the summit does take place, goes well, and maybe even proves fruitful, that would be an encouraging first step toward a scenario in which all stakeholders would be winners. And one in which denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula turns from rhetoric to specific, verifiable, and irreversible moves. Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in has demonstrated a strong personal interest in a thaw in inter-Korean relations, and this has been matched by Kim. Thus next week's planned meeting will likely go ahead smoothly, and culminate in them expressing a shared interest in officially ending hostilities. A successful Moon-Kim summit will certainly make a Trump-Kim one more probable. But, promising as things look, the US president was correct in his assessment that the productive negotiations he wants are possible, not guaranteed. There is the possibility of his history-making summit with Kim being aborted or failing to produce the concrete outcomes he seems to expect. So Trump may want to think twice about what would qualify the summit being a success. Kick-starting a process of constructive engagement and preserving the positive momentum that has been attained may be more realistic, and is certainly desirable. It is perfectly understandable for Washington to want tangible outcomes. Every party except Pyongyang wishes to have the nuclear threat removed overnight. But complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization will not happen unless Pyongyang feels confident it is safe without nuclear weapons. The ""comprehensive resolution of multiple concerns"" that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke of after talking with Trump, while pleasant to the ear, seems unrealistic. It is more reasonable as a goal, not a precondition. For the historic breakthrough he wants, it may be more advisable to be patient, and persistent throughout. At least Pompeo appears to be keeping his feet on the ground, having told his Senate confirmation hearing that no one was under any illusion that a comprehensive deal could be reached at the summit. Let's hope Trump is on the same wavelength.         "
Military drills more than simply 'saber rattling': China Daily editorial,4/18/2018,"                      The People's Liberation Army held live-fire military drills on Wednesday in the Taiwan Straits sending a clear political message to both the island and the world: The Chinese mainland will never allow Taiwan to secede from the motherland. Those who claim that the drills had been hyped up by Beijing and were just ""cheap verbal intimidation"" and ""saber rattling"" fail to appreciate their true portent, that if push comes to shove, China will act to prevent its territory being scraped away. And the suggestion the drills were aimed at creating unease among Taiwan compatriots falls wide off the mark. Instead, the drills served to reassure them that the Chinese mainland will do whatever it can to protect them from being led astray. For the fault lies not with those who might be taken in by such nonsense but with those whose words seek to deceive them. To the rest of the world, and in particular those countries which are trying to interfere in China's internal affairs by using the island as a pawn in their own games, these drills were a signal that there is no room for bargaining when it comes to China's territorial integrity. The Taiwan Travel Act US President Donald Trump signed in March and the recent US approval of the sale of military submarine technology to the island have only served to increase tensions across the Straits. Whatever the United States hopes to gain by encouraging the secessionists in their ultimately futile antics, it won't do anything to sap China's resolve to defend its territorial integrity. Instead, in doing so, it risks letting the situation get out of hand. For, abetted by the US, the secessionists are becoming ever more daring in their dangerous pursuits. This bodes ill not only for cross-Straits relations but also for the region, which has been hopeful that the engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would see the cloud of potential conflict fade. The Chinese mainland is sincere in doing whatever it can to seek the peaceful reunification of the island with the motherland. However, it would be wrong for any dreaming of the island's secession to consider efforts in this regard as a demonstration of weakness or indetermination. Although it remains the last resort, the PLA will act if forced to do so.         "
Questions to be answered in Hongmao liquor case,4/17/2018,"                      It is obviously not sensible for a medical professional to give a sensational title to an otherwise academic article he posted online. Especially when his article accuses the liquor of being toxic rather than having medicinal benefits as its manufacturer claims.  The county’s public security bureau is taking legal action against him claiming he has committed a criminal offense by tarnishing the liquor’s reputation. But it is still not proper for police officers from Liangcheng county in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, where the liquor is brewed, to travel all the way to Guangzhou in South China’s Guangdong province to detain the 39-year-old anesthetist.  The liquor, which is actually a concoction of more than 60 kinds of medicinal herbs, is registered as a nonprescription medicine, but the article said its health benefits were exaggerated by the producer, and it had been punished by some drug supervision authorities for false advertising.  Therefore, what the State Administration for Market Regulation has done is right. It has required its local counterpart in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region to make the brewer of the liquor give an explanation about its misleading advertisements. The brewery is also required to publish a detailed account about the safety and effectiveness of its concoction. It also has to reveal any possible side effects that may result from drinking the liquor.  The Inner Mongolia procuratorate having reviewed the materials related to the case has ordered the Liangcheng county procuratorate to return the case to the local police for further investigation. And it has ordered the writer of the post be released in the meantime.  Even if the doctor’s article has damaged the liquor’s image, it should be a civil not a criminal case.  As for what the brewery has done with its advertisements, how could the misleading ads continue to be published both in TV and other media after being notified as violating related legal codes? Does this have anything to do with inadequate market regulation and supervision?  The relevant media and those departments responsible for checking ads should also be investigated to see if they should be held accountable for any wrongdoing.         "
US should not politicize economic competition,4/17/2018,"                          Visitors walk in front of the ZTE stand at the Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, Feb 22, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]   The denial order the United States Commerce Department activated against ZTE on Monday may prove fatal to the Chinese telecommunications company. But the impact of the decision may go beyond the fate of an individual company in the context of the ongoing trade spat and economic competition between the US and China.  The ZTE case in itself is hardly complex. The company admitted violating US sanctions against Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in March 2017 by shipping telecommunications equipment to them.  Aside from agreeing to pay $1.19 billion in fines and to punish the employees involved, it accepted a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which was to be activated if there was any new violation or breach of the agreement.  The US Commerce Department has now activated that denial order prohibiting US companies from selling, exporting or re-exporting components, software and technology to ZTE, as it claims the Chinese company broke the agreement by not disciplining its employees as agreed.  Considering the company’s heavy reliance on US products and technologies, the otherwise robust ZTE now faces an existential crisis. Many of its suppliers, including those in the US, will also suffer.  Announcing the decision, the US Commerce Department stated it is “a regulatory action” “unrelated to any ongoing trade-related actions”. It is to be hoped that this is indeed the case. If this is Washington’s reply to Beijing’s recent pledge of greater openness, it cannot but worsen trade relations and press Beijing to roll back what it was ready to offer.  While the overall response at home among industry insiders is the belief that the decision has been timed to enhance the US’ position at the bargaining table in their trade dispute, there is also a consensus that Chinese companies need to develop their own core technologies rather than rely on US suppliers. And there is an assumption that the decision is related to the rivalry between the two countries now that China is competing in the high-tech field rather than just low-end manufacturing.  China’s Ministry of Commerce is right to raise concerns that the ZTE move is symptomatic of Chinese companies not competing in a fair and equitable legal and policy environment, as the action comes when the US has been increasing the pressure on Chinese telecommunications companies as part of its restrictions on Chinese investment and acquisitions in high-tech sectors.  It is understandable that the US seeks to maintain its advantages, but economic issues should not be politicized as a means to curb competition. This should be about the conduct of ZTE, it should not be exploited to denigrate other Chinese companies.         "
Neighbors must make the most of new start: China Daily editorial,4/16/2018,"                            State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo on Monday. MA PING / XINHUA     A visit by a Chinese foreign minister to a neighboring country and an economic dialogue session between China and a next-door neighbor should not be a big deal. It would not be were that neighbor not Japan, and such visits and dialogues not been respectively postponed for nine and eight years.  That such a visit and conversation have finally taken place means a lot to both Beijing and Tokyo, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty.  That the two parties have chosen to repair ties and reopen high-level economic dialogue after such a long hiatus has naturally inspired high hopes in both countries that substantial improvements in broader ties will materialize.  Trade is a fitting starting point for any serious attempt at restoring the China-Japan relationship. It has long served as the ""ballast and propeller"" of bilateral political relations, as well as overall state-to-state relations. The high-level economic dialogue is the highest intergovernmental mechanism for economic cooperation, and it is supposed to facilitate corresponding policy communication and coordination.  In spite of their previous exchanges of tough rhetoric, Beijing and Tokyo know their economies are indispensable to each other. However, that they are most important trading partner to each other is only a relatively small, and increasingly smaller, part of their mutual significance. Recent changes in the global economic landscape, especially the rise of anti-globalization, protectionist tendencies, reveal increasing common interests between the two countries. Their shared reliance on overseas resources and markets determines a keenly felt shared interest in safeguarding free trade and economic globalization.  And despite the troubles brewed by history and their territorial dispute, the two governments appear to converge on the need to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said he is eager to brief his host on the ""very positive important changes"" in the situation on the peninsula. Such an encouraging sign of bilateral communication is crucial for retaining the current momentum toward peaceful engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Wang's visit will be conducive to positive interaction at higher levels, especially his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But, despite this, the ""substantial upgrade"" in bilateral ties well-wishers anticipate may not come easily.  Wang was correct in reminding his Japanese counterpart of ""complex and sensitive factors"" that have to be overcome to improve the China-Japan relationship. The relationship has demonstrated special vulnerability and the two governments will have to work hard to manage their differences.  It is to be hoped the shared desire to improve relations is based on sound foresight rather than merely blind hopes.         "
Strikes on Syria set a bad example in world politics,4/16/2018,"                          Smoke is seen from a distance in the Syrian capital Damascus on April 14, 2018.[Photo/Xinhua]   The military strikes the United States and its allies launched against government targets in Syria set a very bad example, circumventing the United Nations and making such military actions an option the world's superpower can use any time it wants against any country it doesn't like.  The excuse was a chemical weapons attack on the town of Douma, which the Syrian government has repeatedly denied, with the strikes launched immediately before a fact-finding mission by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was about to begin. Why did the US and its allies not wait until the investigation yields a result?  It reminds us of what happened to Iraq in 2003 when the United States invaded the country claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found, and the war led to the protracted turmoil in Iraq and the rise of the Islamic State group. For that war, the United States and its allies owe the Iraqi people and the world an apology.  It is Syria this time, a country that entered its eighth year of war in March. Nothing is more urgent than political stability and national reconciliation for this country. At the time when the Syrian government forces have gained the upper hand in the civil war, there seems no reason for it to use chemical weapons to provoke the United States and its allies, which have long been considering the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.  Given the complexity of the situation in Syria, the military strikes will only make it even more difficult for the parties involved to work out a peaceful solution and for the country to emerge from war.  The arbitrary and abrupt military action by the United States and its allies will likely complicate the possibility of political solutions to the settlement of other hotspot issues. Its spillover effects will have an impact on the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula, in which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will have reason to consider the possession of nuclear weapons as the sole guarantee for it to avert such military strikes by the United States and its allies.  It is a pity that the Security Council of the United Nations on Saturday failed to adopt a resolution to condemn the airstrikes. But history may prove them as wrong just as it has the US' military impulsiveness in Iraq.         "
Hainan to set pace for an open and inclusive economy: China Daily editorial,4/15/2018,"                                                 Nightview of Sanya bay in Hainan province. [Photo/VCG]   While President Xi Jinping's remarks at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province on Tuesday, that China will further broaden market entry, attract investment, strengthen intellectual property rights protection and increase import, were a reassuring affirmation that China will continue to advance reform and opening-up. What he said three days later that China will turn Hainan Island into the world's largest free trade zone carries greater symbolic weight.  With Deng Xiaoping as the leading advocate, the decision was made 30 years ago to make Hainan province the largest special economic zone. It was eight years after the model had proved a success in Shenzhen, but reform and opening-up had met stiff resistance from some in the country.  However, it has proved to be a correct and timely decision, transforming the island from a rubber farm to a regional trade, logistics, economic and technology hub over the past three decades.  And, as Xi said, all great causes move forward by carrying on the achievements of our predecessors.  That the central authorities' decision has been made public directly by Xi, demonstrates the importance that Beijing attaches to the move. It comes at a time when the world's largest economy is pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor approach. It drives home the message that China will not shut its doors to the rest of the world and that it has confidence in its chosen development path.  It is predictable that Hainan will enjoy more autonomy to leverage its potential in promoting the trade of both goods and services, and the development of a modern economy.  But to realize these objectives, Hainan must, in the first place, adapt its governance to the needs of these tasks. It has to realize a good balance between economic growth and ecological preservation. This is extremely crucial to the island in its bid to become a leading international tourist destination.  Hainan has played an important role in the past in pushing forward reform and opening-up. Now it has been given the opportunity to do so again. This time the island province has not only to be a pioneer in developing its own economy, it has also to be a forerunner setting an example for the country.  The upgrading of Hainan's role from the regional to the global stage speaks volumes about how committed China is to inclusive and shared development rather than seeking a zero-sum trade game.

Strikes risk leading to out-of-control situation: China Daily editorial,4/14/2018,"                          Syria air defences strike back after air strikes by U.S., British and French forces in Damascus, Syria in this combination photo of still images obtained from video dated early April 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Chemical weapons have rightly been anathema since their horrors were revealed on the battlefields of World War I. Since then, there has been a strong and sustained shared international will to prohibit not only their use, but also their development, production, acquisition, or stockpiling, as set out in the Chemical Weapons Convention that came into force in 1997, and which 192 states are now party to.  Thus the United States and its allies have tried to claim the moral high ground when justifying their military strikes against government targets in Syria early on Saturday morning, having previously pointed the finger of blame at President Bashar al-Assad for a suspected chemical weapons attack on the town of Douma.  However, the Syrian government has repeatedly denied it was responsible, and the military action by the US, France and the United Kingdom came before the fact-finding team dispatched by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was due to start work later in the day.  Russia's foreign affairs committee chairman Konstantin Kosachev has even suggested the strikes were an attempt to hamper or block the OPCW starting work in Douma. As Russia has already claimed the attack was staged to incriminate the Syrian government, President Vladimir Putin condemned it as ""an act of aggression"" against a sovereign nation.  While it is right for the international community to act to prevent the normalization of chemical weapons use, any action should be done in accordance with the UN Charter and international law, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged. That requires the comprehensive, fair and objective investigation that China has called for be carried out to get to the truth of the matter.  Instead, the US and its allies have carried out an “adventurist action” without even waiting for the OPCW to take a position, as the Iranian Foreign Ministry said.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May has claimed there was no “practicable alternative to the use of force"" and that the strikes were not about ""regime change"", but her words need taking with a large pinch of salt if they are to be swallowed, given in the past all three countries have said the war in Syria should end on terms that do not leave Assad in power, and their current antagonist stance toward Russia, which has been acting in support of his regime.  It was only a few weeks ago that US President Donald Trump spoke of withdrawing the US presence from Syria, and in his address from the White House announcing the actions, he said, ""under no circumstances"" does the US seek an indefinite presence in Syria. Yet his hasty action suggests that the US is becoming even more ensnared in what is already a complex web of competing influences in the country, perhaps as a result of the current administration’s antagonistic stance toward Iran.  And there's the rub. While the Syrian people will be hoping there is an end to their suffering, that does not look like coming any time soon. For Syria has become the nexus for regional power plays and the arena for a shadow war between the West and Russia that portend even worse is to come if all involved do not exercise restraint and instead allow the current hostilities to escalate.

Who trades with whom not up to US to decide: China Daily editorial,4/12/2018,"                      Since its inception in 1994, the Summit of the Americas has been a venue for the United States and Latin American nations to sort out intra-America concerns, most noticeably US-Latin America trade. And “fair and reciprocal trade” is expected to command the limelight at the Friday-Saturday gathering in Lima, Peru. Yet a parallel priority on the US delegation’s agenda, according to the White House, is to “push back against external economic aggression”. It did not bother to elaborate. But no elaboration is needed. As former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson made it crystal clear on his first, also last, official visit to the region in February, Washington is worried about the growing Chinese economic presence in what it still considers to be its backyard. It remains to be seen whether or not US Vice-President Mike Pence will be as blunt as Republican Senator Marco Rubio would like, and declare Chinese involvement in the area as “unacceptable”. But chances are he will use both carrots and stick to tell Latin American leaders his country, not China, should be their “partner of choice”. While Washington’s recent fixation with China’s growing presence in global trade is more or less understandable considering the increasing China-related competition, its idea to dictate other countries’ choosing of trading partners is outrageously inconsistent with its call for trade with those nations to be “fair and reciprocal”. Trade can’t be fair if they can’t even decide with whom to do business. China, which will be attending the summit as an observer for the first time, is the biggest or second-biggest trade partner for a majority of Latin American countries. Trade ties are fair, reciprocal and free of bullying. All parties in such relations appear satisfied with what they see as mutually beneficial trade. Rather than any Chinese attempt to undermine US influence in its own backyard, it is Washington’s own sense of insecurity that may end up isolating the US in its immediate neighborhood.         "
Hasty response will aggravate Syria crisis: China Daily editorial,4/12/2018,"                          A man is washed following alleged chemical weapons attack, in what is said to be Douma, Syria in this still image from video obtained by Reuters on April 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The shadow of war that has fallen over Syria is darkening with US President Donald Trump raising his pitch with each passing day and threatening “missiles will be coming” in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack on Saturday.  At least 60 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in the suspected chemical weapons attack on Syria’s last rebel-controlled area on Saturday, but before there is even an international investigation into the attack to determine what happened and who is to blame, a knee-jerk reaction like the one Trump is threatening will only further complicate the situation and create a greater humanitarian disaster in the war-torn country.  That the United Nations Security Council failed to approve three draft resolutions on setting up an international investigation into the attack on Tuesday shows Washington and Moscow, the two belligerent parties over the issue, need to narrow their differences.  After all, paralyzing the world body does not help international efforts to diagnose and address the grave situation in Syria.  The Syrian people have surely suffered enough after seven years of conflict. Yet even after the Islamic State extremists were defeated in the country, the fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, and the rebels, supported by the US, has continued.  A hasty military strike against the Assad regime would increase the possibility of what has been a shadow clash between Washington and Moscow turning into a head-on confrontation.  The two countries should try harder to avoid such a scenario from coming true because it will further aggravate the situation in Syria and only create fertile ground for extremist organizations. And combating terrorists was the professed reason the two countries became involved in the Syrian civil war.  The US leader should, in particular, restrain his penchant for warmongering rhetoric, especially since his country’s military action in neighboring Iraq is responsible for having sparked the current chaos in the Middle East. And in recent years, other countries in the region besides Syria have become mired in conflict and social instability because of the US’ interventionist policy.  Experience shows diplomacy is still the best option for defusing a crisis such as the one in Syria. The United States should think twice before plunging the region deeper into bloodshed and conflict, and take a step back to reappraise its policy toward the Middle East.         "
Looted cultural heritage ought to be restituted: China Daily editorial,4/11/2018,"                          A bronze water vessel, known as Tiger Ying, is up for auction in Kent. The Canterbury Auction Galleries / For China Daily   Canterbury Auction Galleries in the United Kingdom has turned a deaf ear to the State Administration of Cultural Heritage’s urging that it cancel the auction of a rare Chinese bronze water vessel looted by a British soldier from Beijing’s Old Summer Palace in 1860.  It may think it has done nothing wrong in proceeding to auction the item on Wednesday.  It is true, as the British auction house reportedly argued, that there is no law in the United Kingdom preventing it from doing so, and that a UNESCO convention, adopted in 1970, to prohibit the illicit import, export and transfer of cultural relics, to which the UK became a party in 2002, is not retroactive.  But auctioning such spoils not only disregards the feelings of the Chinese people, it is also tantamount to giving connivance to an appalling act of cultural theft.  The ransacking of the Old Summer Palace by the French and British troops during the Second Opium War (1856-60), one of the most infamous chapters in Chinese history, resulted in the loss of many cultural treasures, which China has been trying to recover.  Yuanmingyuan, Garden of Perfect Brightness, once had the most fabulous collection of cultural treasures in the country and its looting and ruin is a unhealed historical wound cut deep into the nation’s psyche. The auctioning of the vessel, which dates back to the Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 11th century-771 BC) has thus sparked fierce public indignation.  The repatriation of looted cultural heritage to the country of origin has increasingly become accepted as an obligation by people around the world. Yet those that benefit from stolen or illegally exported cultural objects, whether as sellers, buyers or facilitators, still resist this legitimate consensus.  The Chinese Cultural Relics Society has estimated that China lost more than 10 million antiques since 1840 because of wartime looting and illegal excavations, and the Chinese government is making great efforts to restitute these items and put an end to the illicit trade in them.  Other countries can play their part by recognizing the fundamental importance of the protection of cultural heritage and effectively combating the trade in illicitly acquired cultural objects.  Compensation to the present owners may be needed to effect restitution and return, but intervention is needed to curb sales of cultural objects that were acquired illicitly.         "
US should not force China to shut door to it: China Daily editorial,4/11/2018,"                          A container ship waits for departure at Qingdao Port. [Photo by Zhang Jingang/For China Daily]   In an opinion piece for the Financial Times this week, US President Donald Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro accused Beijing of building “a Great Wall of denial” about what he alleged was its “illicit and protectionist” behavior.  Well-known for his extremely hawkish views on China, such allegations roll lightly off his tongue, but when he went on to spin the suggestion that the Trump administration is acting to realize its vision of a “global trading system free of the imbalances and unfair practices”, even he must have found it hard to get the words out.  Not only has the Trump administration been acting like a child in a playpen coveting the other kids’ toys by withdrawing or threatening to withdraw from previously agreed deals, it has also been threatening to build a Great Wall of tariffs if it doesn’t get the favorable treatment to which it believes it is entitled.  Navarro made it clear why the United States has been picking on China with its tariff threats by noting that since China joined the global trading system in 2001, its GDP has expanded from $1.3 trillion to $11.2 trillion. The US’ envy of a rival with such prowess risks breeding divisions that may be damaging to the global trading system if it does not keep it in check.  For Beijing has already made it clear that it is not going to jump through hoops for Washington.  Which should come as no surprise, since China is no longer a gauche newcomer to international trade etiquette and it is quite capable of standing up to the US’ attempts to browbeat it.  Although President Xi Jinping vowed to further open up the world’s second-largest economy in his speech at the Boao Forum for Asia on Tuesday, that should not be misinterpreted as China caving in to US pressure. The moves, which the White House has called an encouraging step forward, were already on the cards before the current frictions started rubbing the two countries the wrong way. The measures are being rolled out on China’s schedule to meet its development needs, they are not being introduced overnight to satisfy the US administration’s demands.  But that is not to say the moves won’t benefit the US, they will, but only if stops trying to force China to do its bidding. If it persists with applying a zero-sum mentality to trade with China, it is unlikely they will be able to make “great progress together” as it will probably not be welcome to step through the door being opened to China’s financial services sector, for instance.  The trade and investment liberalization heralded by Xi will present many opportunities from which the US can benefit, but only when it realizes it is folly to try and punish your neighbor by fire for an imagined slight when you live next door.

Belligerent economies might miss out on Chinese market,4/11/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping delivers the keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2018 in Boao, Hainan province, on Tuesday. The president announced he would cut tariffs and open the country further to foreign investment. LI XUEREN / XINHUA   Chinese President Xi Jinping's Tuesday pledge to open the Chinese market wider to foreign competition has won praise — not only from thousands of attendees at the Boao Forum for Asia, but also the international community.  The commitment to wider opening-up has strengthened the belief China, as the world's second-largest economy, will continue its role as a defender of free trade and cooperation in contrast to growing protectionism and unilateralism by the United States, best exemplified by US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" approach.  But it would be wrong to interpret China's wider opening-up measures, which include cutting Chinese auto tariffs, allowing more competition in banking and better protecting intellectual property rights, as a conciliatory trade gesture or even giving in to US pressure in order to ease a trade spat with Washington.  That Trump himself tweeted Tuesday he was ""very thankful"" for Xi's comments and praised the Chinese president's ""enlightenment"" also proved he was out of touch with reality and engaged in wishful thinking.  First, China has been promoting its opening-up strategy based on its own timetable and roadmap to better serve its development demands and out of its strong belief economic globalization is an irreversible trend. This has been proven by the successful policy of reform and opening-up as practiced over the past 40 years.  It's ridiculous to call China's long-term strategic choices an expedient move to allay a trade standoff with the United States.  Second, China's opening-up will be continued in line with the Chinese stand, pursuit and tempo and never come at the cost of national interests.  Furthermore, nobody should expect an unlimited and unprincipled opening-up of China under external pressure.  Third, China is fighting against the protectionism and unilateralism promoted by the United States with concrete moves, while a number of countries have issued increasing complaints and warnings against the damage of the US’s policies to the global trade system.  Undoubtedly, China's new opening-up measures will benefit its trade partners in line with global trade rules but they will not be applied to a country that willingly violates World Trade Organization rules and threatens trade wars with others.  That means US industries and companies, who pocket huge profits in China, may miss the opportunities offered by the country's wider market access if the Trump administration continues down this wrong path.

US' sub tech sale increases tensions across the Straits,4/10/2018,"                      Separatists in Taiwan are being naive or self-deceiving if they consider the US State Department’s approval of a marketing license to sell military submarine technology to the island to be good news. It is only in their imaginations that such technology will boost the island’s “defense” capabilities. Even having bought the technology, and should the island manage to master the capability to manufacture submarines on its own, the vessels will not help them achieve their goal. Rather than being good news, the bait the US has offered them to continue pursuing their unattainable ambition is actually bad news; for Taiwan and for the relationship across the Straits. By passing the Taiwan Travel Act and approving the sale of submarine technology to Taiwan, the US government has shown it is intent on using the island as a pawn in its game. By encouraging “official” exchange visits and selling weapons and weapons technology to the island, the Trump administration is intruding in China’s internal affairs. In addition, separatists on the island are being emboldened by what the US is doing, which is encouraging them to go even further with their separatist moves. As a result, cross-Straits relations will only deteriorate. For Taiwan leaders who have refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus on one China, the US’ approval of the sale of submarine technology to the island has provided them with an opportunity to further kidnap the well-being of Taiwan compatriots by touting the island’s relationship with the US as a sign of the island’s “independence”. However, the further Taiwan separatist forces push their bid for secession, the more grave the situation will become. Foresight cannot be gained from the past, by analogy or calculation, it must be divined from what lies before us, and that foretells that without any restraint on their reckless antics the island’s separatists will spark a war. While playing its own game indulging their vanity and vexation, the Trump administration would do well to heed the Chinese adage that if you must play, you should always know the stakes and when to quit. For Taiwan compatriots, peace and prosperity lies in good relations across the Taiwan Straits. The Chinese mainland sincerely seeks to develop amicable cross-Straits ties and realize the peaceful reunification of the island with its motherland, in whatever form possible.         "
"Reform, opening-up not for expediency",4/10/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 on Tuesday. [Photo by Zou Hong/China Daily]   To those who doubt the country’s commitment to economic openness, President Xi Jinping gave his personal assurance that rather than close its doors to the rest of the world, China will open them further, in his Tuesday speech at the Boao Forum for Asia.  Beijing has been consistent in its loyalty to reform and opening-up, the 40-year-old formula of miraculous growth. Yet the rest of the world is anxious for credible evidence that its allegiance to that course was not wavering on encountering headwinds.  What President Xi unveiled in Boao — from greatly loosening market access to creating an investor-friendly domestic market, enhancing intellectual property rights protection and increasing imports — is more than a pleasant surprise, and confirmation that its course remains unchanged. It is a fitting tribute to the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and an all-win prescription for many of the problems between Beijing and its overseas partners.  Despite meaning short-term challenges for some industries at home, they will ultimately emerge stronger in a more open market through fair competition with overseas peers. Overseas consumers and investors, too, will benefit from a more open Chinese economy.  The “measures of landmark significance” the country is to take this year, including broader access for overseas service providers, especially those in the banking, securities and insurance sectors, as well as the loosening of restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry, will greatly mitigate concerns about an impending trade war between China and the United States.  As will the moves to increase imports, improve consistency with international trade rules, introduce transparency and facilitate fair competition, and significantly raise the cost of intellectual property rights violations.  And as Xi pointed out, the country will pay equal attention to “bringing in” and going out, with the first international import expo to be held in Shanghai in November being an important policy statement and action demonstrating China’s embracing of greater openness.  Xi made it clear that increasing openness and expanding cooperation is not merely political expediency.  “This is a strategic choice China has made based on its own development needs,” he stated. A choice rooted in the clear understanding that “China’s second revolution”, as he called it, has not only profoundly changed the country but also greatly influenced the whole world.  Openness was the key that unlocked the door to the future 40 years ago, and greater openness is now indispensable for the country’s future progress.         "
Boosting confidence that development can benefit all,4/9/2018,"                      During his meeting with visiting UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday, President Xi Jinping said that people, not just in China but throughout the world, should have confidence that their expectations to live fulfilling lives will be met, and that all countries, both big and small, should work together to give more people the assurance they can enjoy a better future. In doing so he once again expressed his conviction that countries can cooperate and collaborate to build a global community to address common risks and pursue shared prosperity. That many people in the world have found themselves on the outside looking in while a few have enjoyed most of the fruits of global openness and trade has sparked a populist backlash against the big bang of globalization and prompted fears it may collapse as a more insular mindset has started to prevail in some places. To prevent this condition being aggravated and becoming contagious requires earnest efforts to convince those who currently feel left behind by the train of globalization that they too have a stake in what they perceive to have been a gold mine accessible only to a few. Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia on Tuesday, Xi will surely inject a new dose of confidence in more inclusive development by reaffirming that China is willing to play its part in providing just such a pick-me-up. For as well as reassuring the world that China is open for business, he will assure it that reform will be deepened and opening-up expanded so that more countries and people can benefit from China’s development opportunities and experiences. In introducing these changes at home, China is also looking beyond its doorstep and seeking common development momentum with other countries, not least through tapping the synergies between its Belt and Road Initiative and other countries’ development strategies. As a Chinese saying observes, a single thread cannot become a cord, and a single tree does not make a forest. By embracing openness and innovation with China, and by striving to make the region one for all, Asia can become the first incarnation of a community with a shared future.         "
US should match Trump's friendlier tone with deeds,4/9/2018,"                      Tweeting about his country’s trade spat with China, US President Donald Trump softened his tone on Sunday, claiming that “taxes will become reciprocal and a deal will be made on intellectual property”, forecasting a “great future for both countries”.  While China will hope he is doing more than just reading the tea leaves and that his conciliatory tone is in earnest, it will be aware that few are able to honor a friend who has prospered without envy and without wishing them at least some small misfortune.  And since the ongoing trade frictions between the world’s two largest economies have been triggered by the Trump administration’s obsession with the United States’ trade deficit with China, which it seems to regard as a barometer of China’s competitive economic prowess, and that the US’ shortfall remains colossal, it is hard to place too much faith in Trump’s fortune-reading skills and his prediction that everything is going to be hunky-dory unless he starts matching his words with actions.  The tit-for-tat threats of tariffs have been promises of a similar blow in exchange for a blow, and any kind of deal will require the US to give if it wants to take.  While statistical errors and US companies operating in China account for a large part of the deficit, the US’ one-sided trade policies are also responsible for the huge bilateral trade gap.  For example, the US has long imposed a strict restriction on normal high-tech exports to China to prevent the latter from challenging it as a technological powerhouse. If it relaxed its restrictions on high-tech exports to China, that would soon significantly reduce the deficit.  To be “reciprocal”, the US should also give national treatment to Chinese companies investing in the US. Currently, it commonly resorts to national security excuses to block Chinese companies’ investment in the US, a stance that is in stark contrast with China’s welcoming stance toward foreign companies, including US ones.  It should also recognize China’s progress in building a market economy, for by refusing to respect its market economy status, the US can conveniently adopt the surrogate approach when waging anti-dumping investigations against Chinese companies.  If his administration refuses to make any progress on those, it’s hard to see how Trump’s auspicious words can be given substance.  And China will take its cue not from words but deeds.         "
Still striding forward on the path of reform,4/8/2018,"                      Four decades into China’s earthshaking reform and opening-up, some outsiders wonder whether that 40-year-old commitment will persist.  The apparently escalating trade friction with the United States, initiated by Washington alleging Beijing has failed to honor WTO obligations, for one, has inspired conflicting readings of China’s behavior and intention as a rising economic powerhouse.  But one basic yet often-ignored truth is that China has an inherent need for deeper and wider reform and opening-up in order to move forward.  As the past 40 years have shown, little headway can be anticipated without the national leadership adhering to reform and opening-up, which has been tried and tested and proven effective since the late 1970s. That is precisely why the outside world to which China means so much is preoccupied with identifying any clue to a change in Chinese policy orientation.  Earlier this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, now Vice-Premier Liu He assured those unsure about China’s new era policy orientation that there would be reform and opening-up moves that go far beyond what people might imagine.  Measures of such extent are necessary, not because there is a ceremonial need for them in commemorating the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, which fundamentally changed the Chinese national economic landscape, but because there are too many problems in the country crying out for more reforms and greater openness to solve them.  This year’s Boao Forum for Asia is worth particular attention in this respect, as President Xi Jinping is to deliver a keynote speech in which he is expected to herald deepened reforms and expanded opening-up, signaling to the world that China’s pursuit of progress has not slowed, and that it will continue to stride forward, strengthening its exchanges and cooperation with other countries around the world so that its reform and development benefits not only the Chinese people, but all humanity.         "
China acting in defense of international trade,4/8/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   It goes against the grain to repeat something already told more than once, especially when it has been told so clearly by so many. But it seems that needs must, for the United States continues to turn a deaf ear to warnings that its unilateral actions risk damaging global trade and undermining the global trade system.  China is being forced to react to protect its legitimate interests in the face of the unjustified provocations of the US, but in doing so it is also championing rules-based trade, as the Trump administration has resorted to domestic laws to target Chinese goods with tariffs, a move that runs roughshod over the international trade rules of the World Trade Organization. Those in the world in favor of free trade should support China in its efforts to counter the error of the US’ ways.  Jittery investors in the US have signaled the growing anxiety around the world that the two largest economies are exchanging range-finding fire ahead of a full-on trade war after China had to state once again that its behavior is not malleable to the unreasonable whims of the Trump administration.  That China has not capitulated to the US’ intimidation seems to have put US President Donald Trump’s nose out of joint. For after China responded to the US Trade Representative announcing a proposed list of Chinese imports valued at an estimated $50 billion as targets for additional tariffs with a similar-value list of US imports that it had targeted in turn, Trump directed the USTR to identify Chinese goods for an additional $100 billion worth of tariffs.  Yet Trump well knows that China is not bound to please him or his administration with its responses. Should the Trump administration follow through on its latest threat, it should expect China to announce immediate and vigorous countermeasures in retaliation.  And China still has many cards to play. It could, for instance, consider targeting the cross-border service trade in which the US enjoys a huge surplus with China. And US multinationals in China, which have pocketed tremendous profits in the world’s largest consumer market and account for a major part of China’s nominal trade surplus with the US, could also be a target if the US announces further tariffs targeting Chinese goods.  That would be a scenario that would prompt more in the US to join in the chorus of criticism already directed at Washington. For the stock market reaction is not only about the tit-for-tat tariff announcements; it also reflects the pessimistic prospects for international trade if the Trump administration refuses to stop making protectionist moves to pander to its misguided designs.  The US administration should exercise some restraint instead of trying to do injury to others out of unfounded fears or the need to play to its domestic gallery of supporters.         "
US lifting an ever larger stone that will smash its own feet,4/7/2018,"                      US President Donald Trump upped the ante on Thursday in his trade game with China, announcing he had instructed the US Trade Representative to consider $100 billion of additional tariffs on Chinese imports, after China matched his earlier $50 billion tariff wager with a similar one of its own.  By continually raising the stakes in their trade dispute, Trump is no doubt hoping Beijing will fold; but that is a losing bet. China has repeatedly made it clear that it will not bow to such pressure, saying that although it does not seek a trade war, it is not afraid of one either.     China's Commerce Ministry has responded to the latest move by urging the United States not to insist on unilateralist and protectionist trade practices in disregard of the opposition from China and the international community, warning it that China will not hesitate to fight back at any cost and it is willing to ""follow through to the end"".  Clearly there would be no substantial outcomes from any trade discussions if the US continues to use threats to try and pressure China to compromise its economic interests, and the current conditions make talks impossible.  Regrettably, however, although Beijing has remained steadfast in seeking to ease the bilateral trade tensions through dialogue, its stance has been misinterpreted by some US media outlets, which have mistaken it as being a sign that Beijing is willing to make concessions. Such a misreading, if taken seriously by US policymakers, would lead to US industries and financial markets feeling the consequences of that misjudgment.     China has become the world's second-largest economy and, although it still needs to catch up in competitiveness, it is quite capable of making the US pay a heavy price if the Trump administration is not just posturing and does begin to match its words with actions.  Although Trump claims the tariffs are intended to punish China for what he claims are unfair trade practices, it is the US' unilateralism and protectionism that are challenging the global rules of trade.  Hopefully, ""the president is just blowing off steam again"", as US Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said, and his administration can work with China to iron out their trade differences and find ways to lower the trade barriers on both sides. For Trump surely knows by now that the art of the deal is when both sides walk away happy.         "
China justified in hitting back to protect interests,4/4/2018,"                      Nine hours after the United States published a proposed list of China imports worth around $50 billion in annual trade it has targeted for additional tariffs, China announced a list of US goods totaling the same value that will be subject to equivalent tariff hikes, fulfilling its promise of retaliatory ""measures of the same strength and the same scope"".  Unlike some other US trade partners who succumbed to the Trump administration's raising of tariffs on steel and aluminum products, Beijing, as it has repeatedly said, is ready to stand toe-to-toe with Washington and trade blows if the wheeler-dealers in the US stubbornly persist with their protectionist gambit.  The Section 301 investigation, on which the latest list is based, is a stick that Washington often wields to intimidate its trade partners into conceding to its demands.  However, the Trump administration should realize that such a ploy will not work with China, a country that will not yield to any external pressure aimed at compromising its interests.  Although, the two sides have raised the stakes this time, with Washington targeting machinery, information technology and communication products, and Beijing hitting aircraft, autos and soybeans in retaliation, the world's two largest economies are not yet engaged in a full-fledged trade war. China is adhering to the rules by referring the US' action to the WTO for dispute settlement, and its countermeasures, although forced, have remained restrained and reciprocal.  Indeed, Beijing has never ceased sending the message that there would be no winners if there should be a trade war, and much collateral damage.  It is willing to talk, willing to strike a mutually agreeable balance in bilateral trade. But Washington should not mistake that for weakness. It will continue trading blows if forced to do so.  The Trump administration has turned a deaf ear to the complaints about its trade strategy at home, not least from the business community. Soon farmers, ranchers and other US workers will now be adding their voices to the chorus of blame directed its way.  While President Donald Trump may be thinking more of his core support and the mid-term elections in November than bilateral ties, Beijing continues to keep the longer term and bigger picture in mind.  The US' deficit in its trade with China is the result, primarily, of its low saving ratio, the US dollar's role as an international currency, domestic policies that do not support manufacturing, and its long-term ban on high-tech exports to China. It has also been exaggerated by its outdated way of calculating trade with China.  The complementary nature of the two economies and comparative advantages of China and the US constitute the foundation for bilateral trade, if not for the recalibration of the trade balance.  And since trade is the basis for his decisions, not the target, as a shrewd businessman, Trump surely knows it is time to strike a deal.         "
Taiwan separatists will hit a brick wall if they carry on,4/3/2018,"                      Instead of beating about the bush on the question of Taiwan’s status, Taiwan’s executive head Lai Ching-te recently explicitly declared himself a “worker for Taiwan independence” and claimed that Taiwan is a “sovereign and independent country”.  Such remarks which are repulsive to our ears should serve as a reminder that patriotic people across the Taiwan Straits need to be on high alert against those on the island who harbor the ill intention of splitting it from the motherland.  It is an undeniable fact that Taiwan is part of China. Despite its separation from the motherland for many years, for historical reasons, people across the Straits have long stuck to the consensus that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of it.  The Chinese mainland’s stand on the question of Taiwan could not be clearer. It has made unremitting efforts to promote the peaceful reunification, but it has never ruled out the option of military action if necessary. It is definitely legitimate and justifiable for the mainland to take whatever action it considers appropriate to prevent the country from being torn apart.  Those advocating separatism on the island should never underestimate the resolve of the country’s leaders and the Chinese people to defend every inch of the country’s territorial integrity. The fate of Taiwan should be decided by Chinese compatriots on the island and on the Chinese mainland, never by the will of secessionists.  However, it seems that the United States decision to enact the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages mutual visits by “officials”, seems to have stirred up a hornet’s nest. Separatists like Lai Ching-te should not take it for granted that their remarks touting “Taiwan independence” will woo them supporters. Nor should they rely on such outside support to achieve their nefarious aims, as they are doomed to failure. They will meet their own political Waterloo if they continue to advocate the path of separatism.  Although Washington may be trying to keep Beijing putting out fires here, there and everywhere, the latter well knows its priorities.  The majority of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are opposed to their conspiracy, which will only bring people on the island political turmoil, even military conflict, if they persist.

Troublemakers are still trying to cloud waters,4/3/2018,"                          The PLA air force planes are seen conducting training exercises, Nov 19, 2017. The PLA air force recently conducted a combat air patrol in the South China Sea. [Photo/Xinhua]   Troublemakers always seek to stir up trouble, as can be seen from the words and actions of some countries from outside the region that are trying to foment discord in the South China Sea now that China and its neighbors have successfully calmed the waters.  The latest ill-intentioned outsider trying to throw a wrench in those good works is Francois Rivasseau, the European Union’s head of security policy, who told an Australian newspaper last week that European navies could conduct freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea.  “Fifty percent of our trade goes through this area. We are interested in stability,” he was quoted as saying.  Which is no doubt factual, but also misleading, since his remark implies that such efforts are needed to secure freedom of navigation and overflight in the region and maintain stability.  Such a move would be as welcome as it is necessary — which is to say not at all.  More than 100,000 vessels, or one-third of global shipping, sail through the South China Sea each year, and not one of them has ever made any complaint about their freedom of navigation being impeded.  And while China and some of its neighbors do have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, they have worked hard to manage their differences and prevent the disputes from getting out of hand. It is a consensus among them that they can resolve the disputes themselves without outside interference.  The EU’s proposal to send its navies to the South China Sea is obviously in answer to the United States’ call for its allies to join its freedom of navigation patrols, as the US wants to ensure its naval vessels are free to go wherever they like.  But European leaders should clean up their own backyard before coming thousands of miles to create a mess over here.  Western countries have a long history of meddling in other people’s business, which rarely ends well for those whose business it actually is; some Middle Eastern countries being a case in point.  By partnering with Washington in the latter’s competition with China in the region, the EU may also hope to bolster its ties with the US, which have been somewhat shaky since Donald Trump entered the White House.  However, it should be aware that freedom of navigation patrols are dispensable, no matter the pretext. Indeed, they only serve to complicate the situation and increase the risk of conflict in the region.         "
"Washington, Seoul should not let war games kill talks",4/3/2018,"                          Xi Jinping holds talks with Kim Jong-un at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. At the invitation of Xi, Kim paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to 28. [Photo/Xinhua]   While three feet of ice will not be thawed in a day, as the Chinese saying goes, there have been more positive developments in efforts to melt the ice on the Korean Peninsula since Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, paid a visit to China last week.  After his trip to Beijing, Kim met with visiting International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, during the latter's three-day visit to Pyongyang, which ended on Saturday, and they agreed that the IOC will help the DPRK prepare for the participation in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, also joined an audience of hundreds in Pyongyang on Sunday for a performance by Republic of Korean K-pop singers, the first time such a show has been held in more than a decade.  Both developments were further signs of the DPRK's bid for rapprochement and engagement with the outside world, which of course is crucial if the forthcoming dialogues and any negotiations aimed at the peaceful denuclearization of the peninsula are to yield the desired outcomes.  However, this desirable momentum is vulnerable due to the mistrust that has festered over the years, and it could easily be disrupted or squandered. Not least by the joint military exercises between the US and the ROK that began on Sunday with more than 11,500 US and nearly 300,000 ROK troops taking part. The war games, known as Foal Eagle and Key Resolve, are being staged ahead of the summit between the DPRK and the ROK scheduled for April 27 and a meeting between the US and DPRK leaders penciled in for May.  Considering that the drills normally run about two months and the DPRK views them as a serious provocation, that the proposed talks would be held under the shadow of the US-ROK war games is hardly conducive to amicable discussions.  The thaw on the peninsula should not be taken lightly; it is a precious opportunity to start unraveling this complex historical knot. China hopes all the parties concerned will exercise the utmost restraint and jointly safeguard the current trend of reconciliation. Nothing is more important now than cherishing and sustaining the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring there is an atmosphere favorable for dialogue to bear fruit.         "
"China will hit back again, if US keeps punching: China Daily editorial",4/2/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The tariffs that China imposed on 128 US imports, effective on Monday, were its first blow in retaliation to the recent US tariff hikes.  The import duties raised on $3 billion list of US products, including pork, fruit, and wines, signal that China will not be intimidated by the United States' economic bullying and that to protect its national interests Beijing is willing to stand toe-to-toe with Washington and trade blows as necessary in order to protect its interests.  China ""advocates and supports the multilateral trading system,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement, but the US tariff hikes on Chinese imports of solar panels and steel and aluminum products have ""seriously damaged our interests"". It said the response is ""a proper measure"" adopted according to World Trade Organization rules.  As the Donald Trump administration has threatened to impose new tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports over what it claims has been the theft of US intellectual property rights, there should be no doubt that Beijing will hit back with reciprocal measures targeting US goods and industries on roughly the same scale should those tariffs materialize. Washington should drop the delusion that Beijing might back down if it keeps threatening a trade war.  The push and shove between the world's two largest economies is in danger of escalating into a bruising encounter in which neither side emerges unscathed.  Yet without the experience necessary to interpret such altercations correctly, in matters of moment judgment often goes amiss, and the Trump administration has shown no indication it is willing to soften its belligerent stance toward China, as it seems to believe that it can easily land a knockout blow.  The discord and antagonism, which of late has sprung from the rancorous outrage of a US administration worried that the country may be losing its stature and wherewithal as the undisputed kingpin of trade, could be easily subdued through friendly talks.  Washington should bear in mind the world economy paid a heavy price for protectionism in the 1930s, which led to contraction of global trade by two-thirds. That is why Beijing still insists that dialogue and negotiation are the only way to resolve their differences and frictions in trade.  It would be beneficial for all if its friendly overtures were accepted by Washington. However, at the moment it seems intent on turning a deaf ear to any suggestion that they each make concessions to reach an amicable agreement.  Hopefully, China's retaliation will add a little weight to its words and knock some sense into Washington so that a messy brawl can be averted.         "
Xiongan to blaze a new trail for further reforms: China Daily editorial,4/1/2018,"                      Xiongan has been in constant change since April 1 last year when the CPC Central Committee announced its establishment as a new area to take over some of Beijing’s non-capital functions and blaze a trail for the balanced development of the densely-populated Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area.      An aerial photo shows Rongcheng county in the Xiongan New Area on Oct 26, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   It is no exaggeration to compare its role to that of Shenzhen as a Special Economic Zone in the 1980s and that of Pudong New Area in Shanghai in the 1990s, which were in turn pioneers for reform and opening up at different stages of China’s development in the past four decades.  The success China has achieved based on the experience of Shenzhen in the 1980s and Pudong in the 1990s will hardly be relevant for the development of the interior regions. So a new model is needed to blaze a trail in the new era, which is why Xiongan, 100 kilometers south of Beijing, was chosen as the latest development area.  What has happened to Xiongan over the past year is encouraging. More than 100 high-end and high-tech enterprises have settled there, a tree planting campaign has been carried out, with 100,000 trees being planted there each day. A number of prestigious universities, including Peking University, have started to establish branches there, and the building of a high-speed railway line between Beijing and Xiongan is underway and expected to be completed in 2020, when it will take 30 minutes to travel from Beijing to Xiongan.  A world vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics and high goals are what CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping expects of the development of this new area. To be exact, breakthroughs need to be made to hopefully propel and help navigate the deepening of reforms and opening up.  What this country has achieved in both technology and construction capacity has laid a solid foundation for the high quality construction in the Xiongan New Area. But that is only part of the story. How this new area is built and run is of great significance to the future development of this country.  What is expected are innovations that point to the way to how the reform and opening up will be deepened and how innovation will make a difference to the future of this country.         "
No tolerance for those trying to split country,4/1/2018,"                          Hong Kong celebrates the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland with a flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square on July 1, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   Both the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued strong statements on Saturday expressing their resolute support for the SAR government in its bid to reign in any collusion between Hong Kong separatists and external forces.  Their backing came after the SAR government condemned remarks by Benny Tai Yiu-ting, associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, on Monday.  Speaking at a seminar organized by a Taiwan separatist group in Taipei, Tai, who initiated the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014, called for the establishment of an ""independent"" Hong Kong, which he believed should be decided through ""democratic self-determination"".  Although Hong Kong separatism has now been disguised as ""self-determinism"", which sounds less alarming on the surface, the two are in fact the same. Hence self-determinists who tried to run in the recent by-election of Hong Kong Legislative Council were rightly disqualified by the returning officers. And the opposition camp, which has relied heavily on the support of the radical localists, suffered setbacks in the by-election held on March 11.  What the moderate ""pan-democrats"" need to do if they want to win people's support is to stay away from any form of separatism and help bring Hong Kong's development back on track through further integration into the country's overall development strategy. Calls such as Tai's for Hong Kong's ""self-determination"" lack both reason and truth, but those making them are willing to overlook these obvious flaws in their arguments if they can find a soapbox on which to deliver their message.  But what Tai said in Taipei has given him away. Looking back, it is easy to see that by calling for so-called real democracy, he was concealing his true motivation in orchestrating the ""Occupy"" campaign, which was to foster radical localism to support his separatist delusion.  Tai's remarks came after the Taiwan Travel Act was signed into law in the United States, emboldening those on the island seeking ""independence"" and that may have rubbed off on Tai. These separatists should not let overconfidence make them incautious. They should not underestimate the determination of the central leaders to fend off any attempt to split the country, nor the distrust most Chinese have of them.  Tai spoke in Taipei barely a week after President Xi Jinping said without any ambiguity at the closing of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 20 that not an inch of Chinese territory would be allowed to be taken away, these should not be mistaken for empty words.

Zero-sum mindset risks opening a Pandora's box: China Daily editorial,3/29/2018,"                          Rather than looking to further block Chinese investment in high-tech sectors in a vain attempt to hold back China's economic rise, the Trump administration should heed the observation in its own National Security Strategy that ""competition does not always mean hostility"". [Photo/VCG]   While Chinese and the US officials have indicated the two sides are willing to talk to end their trade frictions and pull the world's top two economies back from the brink of a trade war, that merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying illness that bedevils relations.  As White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday, the United States' offensive is not only about trade, it's also focused on protecting the US' leading position in high-tech industries such as robotics, advanced information technology and aviation, industries which China has identified in its Made in China 2025 strategy as the focus for the country's future development.  That China's strategy has spooked the US can be seen from the report released last week by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which presented the results of its Section 301 investigation into what the US alleges are China's unfair trade practices – this report refers to Made in China 2025 more than 100 times in 200 pages.  Yet it is natural that China should draw up such a plan at this critical stage in its development, since it needs to successfully transition from labor-intensive manufacturing up the value-added chain to drive its future development. Especially since Beijing is well aware that the world is on the cusp of a new technological revolution.  As Premier Li Keqiang said in this year's Government Work Report, the latest global revolution in science and technology and industrial transformation are trends China ""must be on board with"".  But as Navarro's comments show, fearful of China rivaling it in advanced technology, the US is transitioning from the engagement that has underpinned its relationship with China until now to a more confrontational approach.  The US' bid to contain China's technological advancement is part of its wider strategy to maintain its global predominance, but the times are changing, and the Trump administration cannot reverse time's arrow back to the 1980s.  Rather than looking to further block Chinese investment in high-tech sectors in a vain attempt to hold back China's economic rise, the Trump administration should heed the observation in its own National Security Strategy that ""competition does not always mean hostility"".  Instead of opening a Pandora's box of protectionist trade practices, if it shifts its perspective a little, the US would see that its vision of countries ""thriving side-by-side in prosperity, freedom, and peace"" is no different from that of China and there is no reason why the two countries need to lock horns.

DPRK talks can yield payoffs if all engage with sincerity: China Daily editorial,3/29/2018,"                          Xi Jinping holds talks with Kim Jong-un at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. At the invitation of Xi, Kim paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to 28. [Photo/Xinhua]   Kim Jongun's visit to Beijing this week for talks with President Xi Jinping has raised hopes that the planned upcoming series of meetings will produce meaningful outcomes, as the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pledged his commitment to denuclearization, which is the ultimate goal of all the other stakeholders in the issue, including China.  The fruitful results of the meeting between Xi and Kim have been widely recognized by the international community, with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcoming the meeting, and US President Donald Trump saying in a tweet that he had been informed by Xi on Tuesday night that the meeting with Kim ""went very well"" and that Kim looked forward to meeting the US president. A meeting between the two leaders is reportedly in the works for sometime in May, although the time and place have not yet been announced.  After Kim concluded his visit to Beijing, Republic of Korea officials did confirm on Thursday that a meeting between ROK President Moon Jae-in and Kim is to be held on April 27 in the border truce village of Panmunjom. And Japan has reportedly also sounded out the DPRK about a bilateral summit.  Such meetings were inconceivable just a few months ago.  Needless to say, Beijing has been playing its part in realizing and sustaining the positive momentum, as Xi's invitation to Kim shows. But the welcome conciliation that has been achieved must now be cherished and nurtured. At this critical juncture, all the parties concerned should refrain from doing or saying anything that may shatter what is likely a fragile détente, given the suspicions and mistrust that have prevailed in the past. These will need to be assuaged if the opportunities presented by dialogue are to yield anything of substance.  That will require all concerned to show political wisdom, diplomatic flexibility and strategic patience, since the complex knot of history will not be easily unraveled. The stakes could not be higher, and the future will not judge kindly those who are insincere in their efforts to secure a peaceful resolution.  Those involved should also bear in mind that previously wasted opportunities led to the confrontational impasse from which all now hope to emerge unscathed.  It is our hope that the seeds of reconciliation that have been sown can be tended and bear fruit. China is willing to join hands with all parties to make such a prospect come true, and it hopes joint efforts will be made by all to nourish the tender buds of friendlier relations that have emerged this spring.

"Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un hold talks in Beijing",3/29/2018,"                         BEIJING, March 28 - At the invitation of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), paid an unofficial visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday. During the visit, Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.  Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan held a welcoming banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju and watched an art performance together.  Li Keqiang, Chinese premier and member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan attended related activities, respectively.  During the talks, Xi expressed warm welcome on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to Kim for his first visit to China.  Kim said, since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has, with tremendous political courage and a strong sense of responsibility, developed new thinking and new ideas, put them into action, and solved many tough problems that were never resolved and accomplished many big things that were long on the agenda but never got done. These achievements fully proved that the lines of the CPC are correct lines that accord with the national conditions. In particular, Comrade General Secretary has put forward the requirements that the Party should exercise effective self-supervision and practice strict self-governance in every respect, which has contributed greatly to Party building and realized the overall Party leadership over all work. At present, the WPK is also intensifying its efforts in fighting against arrogance, bureaucracy and corruption.  Kim said he sincerely hoped that China will continuously make new great achievements in the course of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and a great modern socialist country.  The two leaders thoroughly exchanged views on the situation of the world and the Korean Peninsula.      At the invitation of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to 28. During the visit, Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Kim before their talks. [Photo/Xinhua]   Xi said that positive changes had taken place on the Korean Peninsula since this year, and China appreciates the important efforts made by the DPRK.  On the Korean Peninsula issue, Xi said that China sticks to the goal of denuclearization of the peninsula, safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula and solving problems through dialogue and consultation.  China calls on all parties to support the improvement of inter-Korean ties, and take concrete efforts to facilitate peace talks, said Xi, noting that China will continue to play constructive role on the issue and work with all parties, including the DPRK, toward the thaw of the situation on the peninsula.  Kim said that the situation on the Korean Peninsula is starting to get better, as the DPRK has taken the initiative to ease tensions and put forward proposals for peace talks.  ""It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,"" he said.  Kim said that the DPRK is determined to transform the inter-Korean ties into a relationship of reconciliation and cooperation and hold summit between the heads of the two sides.  The DPRK is willing to have dialogue with the United States and hold a summit of the two countries, he said.      At the invitation of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to 28. During the visit, Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Kim before their talks. [Photo/Xinhua]   ""The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if south Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace,"" said Kim.  The DPRK hopes to enhance strategic communication with China during the process, jointly safeguard the trend of consultation and dialogue as well as peace and stability on the peninsula, said Kim.  Before the talks, Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Kim at the North Hall of the Great Hall of the People.  After the talks, Xi and Peng held a welcoming banquet for Kim and Ri. While delivering an address, Xi said that in the beautiful season of spring when everything is coming back to life, the unofficial visit of Comrade Kim Jong-un and Lady Ri Sol Ju to China is of great significance for the two countries to deepen communication, strengthen coordination and promote cooperation, and will push the relations between the two parties and the two countries to a new high in the new historical phase, as well as make important contributions to pushing forward the peace, stability and development in the region.  Xi said he had candid and friendly talks with Chairman Kim Jong-un. ""We agreed that carrying forward the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK accords with the common interests of both sides, and is the common strategic choice of both sides.""  ""No matter how the international and regional situation changes, we will both firmly grasp the global development trend and the overall situation of the China-DPRK relationship, strengthen our high-level exchanges, deepen our strategic communication, expand our exchanges and cooperation, and benefit the people of both countries and the people of all countries,"" he said.

He said the fact that he chose China as the destination of his first overseas visit showed his will to carry forward the tradition of DPRK-China friendship, and how he valued the friendship between the two countries.  ""I have had successful talks with General Secretary Xi Jinping on developing relations between the two parties and the two countries, our respective domestic situation, maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and other issues,"" he said.  ""In this spring full of happiness and hopes, I believe my first meeting with General Secretary Xi Jinping will yield abundant fruits of DPRK-China friendship, and facilitate peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said.

""We welcome Chairman Kim Jong-un and Lady Ri Sol Ju to visit China now and again,"" Xi said.  Kim said that the DPRK-China friendship is especially precious, adding he would like to join hands with Xi to follow the noble will of leaders of the elder generations, carry on and develop the DPRK-China friendship that remains unchanged despite winds and rains, and elevate it to a new high under new circumstances.

US should meet China halfway to end trade spat,3/28/2018,"                                             Having already announced plans to impose tariffs targeting a range of Chinese imports, the Trump administration is apparently also considering a crackdown on Chinese investments in the United States. According to reports, Treasury Department officials are working on plans to identify technology sectors, such as semiconductors and 5G wireless communications, in which Chinese companies would be banned frominvesting. Although the plans haven't been finalized yet, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday that ""there will be limitations on foreign investment"", and pending legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives to bulk up the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which currently reviews foreign takeovers on a case-by-case basis, Trump will take ""other action"". Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that one of the options being considered is the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, which enables the US president to regulate commerce in response to an ""unusual and exceptional threat"". While these proposed new curbs on Chinese investments in the US are being touted as part of the Trump administration's punishments for what it alleges are China's violations of US intellectual property rights, by broadening the scope of reviews in this way it is implementing its national security strategy to protect ""critical"" technologies, such as microchips and next-generation wireless technology, in which the US sees China as its main rival and thus a ""threat"". Trade frictions are inevitable between the world's two largest economies, and ""some issues will not be solved overnight"", as Premier Li Keqiang informed a visiting US Congress delegation led by Senator Steve Daines on Tuesday. But by looking at trade as a zero-sum game in this way, the Trump administration is disregarding the highly complementary nature of the two economies and endangering their cooperation, which has been continuously expanding, to the benefit of themselves and the rest of the world. Although China is willing to work toward a solution through dialogue and consultation, it is also ""fully prepared with countermeasures"", as Li informed his guests. If the trade conflict with the US continues to escalate, China will be left with no option but to take more measures to defend its interests. China could consider taking reciprocal measures against US imports of agricultural products besides soybeans, as well as aircraft, automobiles and semiconductors.And should the Trump administration further obstruct Chinese investments in the US, even tougher measures such as restrictions on imports of US services and similar investment reviews would likely be on the table.

Historic Xi-Kim meeting key to regional peace,3/28/2018,"                                                 At the invitation of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), paid an unofficial visit to China from March 25 to 28. During the visit, Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Kim before their talks. [Photo/Xinhua]   Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing this week, at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, shows that China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are maintaining close communication at what is ""a special time"", and it was of ""great significance"".  With the DPRK leader due to have summits with the leaders of Republic of Korea and the United States in the next two months, it is only natural that Xi and Kim should want to compare notes. Suggestions that Beijing had been sidelined by Pyongyang's approaches to Seoul and Washington were always unfounded given the two countries' long-standing friendship, which was forged in the crucible of war.  ""There was no question that my first foreign visit would be to the Chinese capital,"" Kim was quoted as saying by the DPRK's official news agency KCNA.  During the visit, Kim's first overseas trip since taking office in 2011, the two leaders held candid and friendly talks and reaffirmed the traditional friendship between the two countries, which Xi said was the right choice ""based on history and reality"".  Certainly, maintaining and developing the sound relationship between China and the DPRK is of strategic significance for the two neighbors to defend their own and shared interests. It is also in the interests of all since their friendly relations are also essential to maintain the strategic equilibrium in Northeast Asia and help keep potential risks at bay.  This year has seen a welcome easing of tensions on the peninsula, and all parties involved should value this hard-won opportunity and seek to make further progress.  China has repeatedly stressed that it supports all efforts that aim to ease tensions on the peninsula and get the parties concerned back to the negotiating table again.  And it is China's hope a solution that accommodates the interests and concerns of all stakeholders can be found at an early date so that the Korean Peninsula can emerge from under the shadow of conflict and embrace stability and prosperity.  With this in mind, Beijing has said it will continue to play a constructive role in brokering and facilitating talks, and it has called on all parties to support the improvement in inter-Korean ties and make concrete efforts to ensure the talks are a success.

US pulling a fast one with its waste claims,3/27/2018,"                                                 A border guard in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, inpects bundles of waste textiles smuggled into China. Mao Siqian/Xinhua   Does China have an obligation to import and treat the solid waste of other countries?  When a US representative at the World Trade Organization Council for Trade in Goods on Friday expressed concerns that China's ban on imports of solid waste could cause a fundamental disruption in global supply chains for scrap materials, he must have forgotten his country claims to be dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Instead of trying to suggest that China is acting selfishly, it is the developed nations such as the United States that should have a guilty conscience for acting purely out of their own self-interest. For being unwilling to pay the costs of processing their hazardous waste themselves, the developed countries have exported it to China – and other developing countries - which has caused untold damage to its environment and led to Chinese workers contracting serious diseases from sorting and treating the waste.  The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal stipulates that every country has the right to ban the entry of foreign hazardous waste and other sorts of waste. It is absolutely ridiculous and unreasonable to accuse China of breaching WTO rules by banning imports of solid waste.  Even if there was no world treaty about imports and exports of solid waste, it is common sense and should be a moral imperative for each country to process and treat its own solid waste if it is able to. There is no reason why those countries that had become accustomed to exporting their hazardous waste to China should take it for granted they would be able to foist their harmful materials onto it forever.  Restricting and banning the imports of solid waste is not a matter of WTO rules, and neither is it a matter of trade. It is a matter of China implementing its new development priorities, which put people's well-being and environmental health first.  Behind the remarks of the US representative is the condescending manner some in the West habitually adopt toward China and other developing countries, considering them as inferior to their developed counterparts. Such a mentality goes against the values of equality they claim to champion.  Such shamelessness is the instigator of every kind of baseness, not least the slurs with which the US is trying to taint the justified actions of China. It is deceitful for the US to say China is shying away from performing its duty, when it is the US that is trying to wriggle out of its waste disposal obligations.         "
Talks better option than 'economic intimidation',3/27/2018,"                      Even after Vice-Premier Liu He spoke by phone with the US treasury secretary on Saturday calling for concerted efforts to maintain the stability of trade ties between their respective countries, the Trump administration has made it clear that it intends to squeeze as much as it can from China. Having already slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China and threatening to impose tariffs on a list of other Chinese products under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the United States reportedly urged China in a letter last week to cut the tariffs on US automobiles, buy more US semiconductors and give US companies greater access to the Chinese financial sector. By forcing China to open up its market to US companies in this way, the Trump administration will be hoping to narrow the bilateral trade deficit and create domestic jobs, as well as boosting its support ahead of the mid-term elections in November. But what is dangerous is that the Trump administration seems to be determined to get concessions from China, no matter how or what the consequences. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he is ""cautiously hopeful"" that the two sides will ultimately reach an agreement, and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that ""the door of dialogue is always open"". Mnuchin is reportedly weighing up a trip to China for talks, and that should be encouraged. For as Lao Tzu observed, new beginnings are often disguised as painful endings, and the two countries should take the opportunity of their present spat to write a new and progressive chapter for their trade relations. However, the possibility of an escalating trade war cannot be excluded, as China will not be bullied. Beijing has said on numerous occasions that it is willing to talk with Washington to ease the trade differences between the two countries, but it will not sit idly by while its legitimate rights and interests are damaged. As well as harming both sides, such a zero-sum game would also disrupt and depress global trade, which is still showing how sluggishly it recovers from setbacks. On Monday, a Chinese envoy called on World Trade Organization members to jointly lock protectionism ""back into the cage of WTO rules"", saying that the US tariffs breach the organization's rules. The US should heed China's call for it to stop its ""economic intimidation"" and instead engage in talks and uphold the global trading system which it put in place.         "

[Photo/Xinhua]   On Friday, the Ministry of National Defense expressed strong indignation and issued a stern warning after a US warship entered the waters around Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea.  The guided missile destroyer USS Mustin was warned away after it entered Chinese waters around China's Nasha Islands without permission.  The latest US move is just one of the 11 in the past few years, as the world' sole superpower has been ramping up its ""freedom of navigation"" operations, which it is using as a pretext for surveillance activities and countering what it claims are China's excessive maritime territorial claims in the waters.  However, it is the US' actions which risk impeding freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, as they have become a hazard in the waters.  And with the US resorting to repeated provocations against China in the South China Sea, the risks of it becoming a hotbed for China-US confrontation and even a regional flashpoint are certainly rising since the US operations increase the possibility of close encounters between the two countries' air forces and navies, which could, in turn, lead to a strategic misjudgment or even an accident.  The US' actions also run counter to the regional trend, as, over the past year or so, the tensions arising from the maritime disputes involving China and a few Southeast Asian countries have been markedly abated due to the concerted efforts of countries in region to build peace and stability in the waters.  Considering that the US under President Donald Trump is acting in an increasingly confrontational way against China, a head-on clash between the two countries' militaries in the waters, as some in the world arena have predicted, no longer seems a remote possibility.  Therefore, China is obliged to continue to improve its defense capabilities, so that both its air force and navy have improved combat readiness and capabilities.  If such an undesirable scenario does materialize, the US will bear the sole responsibility for it, for by permitting the risks to grow to such an extent in the South China Sea with its naval operations, it is also pushing China-US relations to the brink of a military showdown.

China can protect its interests even if a trade war breaks out: China Daily editorial,3/25/2018,"                                             China's response after US President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Thursday which imposes tariffs on Chinese imports is clear: The country will take countermeasures and the United States will pay a heavy price for its decision if it does not ""pull back from the brink"". Speaking with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone on Saturday morning, Vice-Premier Liu He said that China is ""fully prepared"" and is ""capable of safeguarding its national interests"". Liu also pointed out the US is violating global trade rules, and its actions are detrimental to the interests of China, the US, and the whole world. White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro has claimed that China benefits far more from trade relations with the United States rather than the reverse, meaning retaliation might be difficult for China, but that ignores the trade in services from which the US clearly benefits more, as well as China's consistent stance that it will resolutely oppose unilateral trade actions and it will not give in to threats or blackmail. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has suggested that what the US is doing is seeking an advantageous position prior to negotiations: ""There may be some firing shots over the bow and things like that, but I believe at the end of the day, this will end up in a negotiation settlement."" But by using threats as a means to get more concessions in any negotiations, the Trump administration is misreading the situation. The US should take China's resolve and capability to defend its own legitimate rights and interests seriously and act rationally. Beijing has repeatedly sought dialogue with Washington to amicably settle the trade differences between them. And as a country that has always championed free trade, which has greatly benefited the country, as well as the rest of the world, China seeks a global trading system that is balanced, fair and inclusive. However, rather than accepting that trade is beneficial to all parties concerned, the Trump administration seems to believe that trade is zero-sum competition in which the US should be the only winner. The international community's concerns over the US' reckless and dangerous policies and actions highlight how important the world's two largest economies are to global trade. The US should avoid placing China-US trade relations in danger and pull back from a trade war.         "
US will not be left unscathed in a trade war,3/24/2018,"                      ""Pull back from the brink"" is the stern advice China gave to the US administration after President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum on Thursday imposing restrictive tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports and restricting Chinese investments in the US.  China's response, although measured, signals the escalation of a trade dispute triggered by the protectionist-minded US administration prone to taking unilateral decisions, with the Chinese embassy in Washington warning that ""China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures"".  That China's reciprocal measures will be taken in two stages leaves room for further negotiation and dialogue to resolve the trade disputes between the world's two largest economies, in order to avoid a trade war, which would disrupt the on-going recovery of the global economy.  ""China doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,"" the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. ""China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink… and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.""  Washington would do good to heed Beijing's advice, because a trade war would hurt China, but not leave the US unscathed if China retaliates. According to economists' calculation, a trade war may slow down US economic growth, raise consumer goods prices, and increase unemployment, especially in the Rust Belt, contrary to Trump's claim that American jobs would be protected because of trade actions against China.  According to a University of Pennsylvania study, a full-blown trade war would, over time, offset any gains of economic growth from the US' newly implemented tax cuts; it would also eliminate a year's worth of wage growth.  By taking punitive trade measures under the outdated Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 against its major trade partner on the pretext that its ""unfair"" trade activities have hurt US interests, the Trump administration may be hoping to woo voters in the mid-term election this year. But when voters realize that, instead of being protected, their interests have been undermined, Trump's stratagem will backfire.  Trump cannot lower the US' colossal trade deficits with its major trade partners by imposing higher tariffs on imports, since the root cause of the problem is the ultra-low savings rates of Americans and the international division of labor. For Trump, it is easier to blame other countries for the US' problems and garner votes in the mid-term election, instead of taking the pain to restructure the country's economy. He cannot force China to give in, however, because China knows the US' demands are insatiable.  Trade disputes should be resolved through discussions and negotiations under the framework of the World Trade Organization, not by unilaterally imposing tariffs.  Unilateral and protectionist moves usually lead to tit-for-tat trade retaliations, which today will disrupt the global trade and economic growth. But during his 14 months in office, the US president has cared little for multilateral trade or global growth.  Perhaps it's time to remind Trump that in the early years of the 20th century, the US initiated protectionist trade measures to protect its domestic industries, forcing its trade partners to take similar measures, which resulted in a sharp contraction of global trade and economic growth. History does not repeat itself but only if we learn the right lesson from it.  By imposing harsh and unjustified restrictive tariffs on its trade partners, the US risks dragging the world into another destructive trade war, whose fires will also scald the US.         "

China-Myanmar ties will continue to prosper,3/21/2018,"                                                 FILE PHOTO- Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw speaks during the opening session of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, July 15, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]   Although Myanmar President U Htin Kyaw abruptly resigned on Wednesday saying he needed a rest, the move, which comes amid reports that the 71-year-old is in ill health, is unlikely to affect the political situation in the Southeast Asian country too much. First Vice-President U Myint Swe, a retired general, will temporarily step into the executive role for now, with Htin Kyaw’s successor to be selected by parliament within seven days.  As Myanmar's first civilian president in recent times, Htin Kyaw was elected two years ago after the National League for Democracy, led by Myanmar's charismatic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, won a sweeping victory in the national election.  Since the NLD came to power, China has been the country most visited by Myanmar's leaders, with Suu Kyi visiting once in 2016 and twice in 2017, and Htin Kyaw paying a visit in 2017. Such visits demonstrate the importance Myanmar's civilian government attaches to China-Myanmar ties.  And China has demonstrated it is a friendly neighbor and trustworthy partner of Myanmar by playing a constructive role in Myanmar's peace process and helping ease tensions in Myanmar's Rakhine state.  When Suu Kyi and the Myanmar government came under fierce criticism from Western countries for the Rakhine crisis, China proposed a three-phase solution for the issue, starting with a cease-fire to help ease the crisis.  Beijing has also demonstrated its willingness to help Myanmar's economic and social development through deepened cooperation in various fields.  Bilateral cooperation in major projects, such as the China-Myanmar crude oil pipeline which was put into operation in April, has brought reciprocal benefits to the two countries and laid a solid foundation for the two neighbors to forge strengthened cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. On Tuesday, representatives of the two countries signed a letter initiating China's aid for the construction of a new bridge in Myanmar's northern Shan state aimed at boosting the development of cross-border trade between the two countries.  China has long recognized the strategic importance of its relations with Myanmar, which is also a priority in its peripheral diplomacy, and its leaders will be looking to work with the next president, whoever it may be, to keep up the desirable momentum in bilateral ties.

Rest of the world must stand together to prevent trade war,3/21/2018,"                                             The world's major financial leaders rejected protectionism at their meeting in Argentina on Tuesday, but failed to exorcise the specter of the trade war being materialized by the protectionist moves of the United States.  With Washington threatening to take more unilateral actions after imposing restrictive tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum products, the finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies only said they agreed to the declaration on trade from the 2017 Hamburg Summit and recognized the need for more “dialogue and actions” in their final communiqué.  By avoiding direct wording in opposition to Washington's escalation of disruptive trade measures, the other G20 members showed they are yet to reach a consensus on how to tackle the US' beggar-thy-neighbor moves.  More serious, the message of inaction sent by the G20 statement may be viewed by the US as an attempt at appeasement.  But the Trump administration will not be satisfied by what it has done so far - and China will not be its only target.  As Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said during the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, the looming trade war would be a ""negative sum game"". It is a reflexive response by the US to changes in the global trade order that are not to its liking. But it needs to adjust to the developments, rather than bring all to ruin through a misguided belief it can hold on to the past.  According to a 2017 estimation by the China International Capital Corporation, if the US raised tariffs on average by 5 percentage points, it would, in the short term, reduce China's GDP growth by 0.07 percentage points and raise the US' GDP growth by 0.12 percentage points; but in the meantime, it would also push up the US' inflation rate by 0.24 percentage points and lower the global economic growth by 0.06 percentage points, which will lead to reduced global demand for US goods and services, and affect its GDP growth.  Since the US seems unlikely to mend its ways, other countries should stop hoping they will be spared its protectionist shots and become more resolute in standing firm against them, not least since history shows the pinpricks of protectionism can ultimately lead to the shots of war somewhere down the line.

Thaw in Sino-Japanese ties can benefit whole region: China Daily editorial,3/20/2018,"                                             This year marks the 40th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and as there has been a thawing of bilateral relations recently, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that he will consider paying an official visit to Japan while attending the China-Japan-ROK leaders' meeting planned for the first half of this year. Li's remarks, made while speaking at a news conference after the annual session of China's top legislature concluded, is recognition that spring has arrived after a long winter of discontent between the two neighbors in which ties were frozen. Since last year, there have been several positive developments signaling the two neighbors are hoping to break the ice between them. But to be frank, the responsibility for plunging bilateral ties to such a low level does not lie with China, and, so far, Japan has said a lot but delivered very little in the way of concrete efforts to put bilateral ties back onto the right track again. Japan should honor the spirit and consensus of the four bilateral political agreements between the two sides so as to ensure there is an atmosphere conducive for sincere discussions. And as Li said, the aim of such talks should not be a short-term arrangement but lasting improvement in bilateral relations; that calls for commitment and vision. Correctly diagnosing the ills of the present will foretell a healthier future for relations, not only between Beijing and Tokyo, but also Tokyo with Seoul. The trilateral leaders' meeting, a mechanism intended to enhance trilateral cooperation, has been dormant in recent years because of Tokyo's irresponsible stance toward historical issues, which has soured relations with Beijing and Seoul. A resumption of the trilateral mechanism this year would not only help improve Japan's relations with its two neighbors, it would also help advance negotiations on a long-in-the-works trilateral free trade agreement, which would also help build trust and bring the three closer together. Given that China, Japan and Republic of Korea are all major players in East Asia and Northeast Asia, they can make a big contribution to addressing regional issues such as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by working together. Better relations among the three would send a strong signal that they share a common desire to promote peace and prosperity in the region.         "
Xi offers insights for building shared future,3/20/2018,"                                                 President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the closing meeting of the country's top legislative session in Beijing on March 20, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   Delivering a speech at the closing of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that China will never seek development at the expense of other countries.  His pledge that China's development poses no threat to any country is a counterblast to those trying to indict China as a threat, for as he observed, ""Only those who are accustomed to threatening others see everyone as a threat.""  He clarified that China hopes to help build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world with lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity and called for China's efforts to this end not to be misinterpreted or distorted.  What he said in his speech provides a clear insight into China's vision of a community of shared future for humankind, one that is united in the fight against common challenges and pulls together for shared development.  China has been making its own practical efforts in this regard. It has given assistance to help many developing and underdeveloped countries and seeks to shoulder its international responsibilities to the best of its capabilities; not least through its contributions to the United Nations' peacekeeping mission. It has also introduced its own public goods, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which are intended to benefit as many countries as possible.  Through enhanced hard and soft connectivity, China hopes that countries can realize shared development and friendly relations so the sunshine of a community with a shared future illuminates the world.  This is because Chinese people have a strong sense of fairness and empathy, and associate their own country's future and destiny with those of other countries and peoples, and they want to do their utmost to contribute to world peace and global development.  Instead of seeking hegemony and pursuing a policy of expansionism as major powers did in the past, China will never impose its will on other countries. Instead, Xi urged countries to use dialogue as the channel for settling conflicts and disputes and resolving any differences.  That is why Xi said in his speech that China will continue to participate in the reform and development of world governance as well as contribute more ""Chinese wisdom, Chinese solutions and Chinese strength"" to promote lasting peace and stability in the world.

China and Russia forging new type of international ties,3/20/2018,"                      On Saturday, Xi Jinping was reelected president of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission. Barely two days later, Vladimir Putin secured a fourth term as president of Russia. Besides exchanging congratulations and praising each other for their achievements as leaders of their respective countries when they talked by phone on Monday, the two leaders spoke highly of China-Russia ties and vowed to further consolidate the all-weather partnership of comprehensive strategic cooperation. Both agreed that bilateral relations have reached an unprecedented height, and there are bright prospects for developing them further by advancing together hand-in-hand. Such mutual endorsement at the start of their respective new terms in office certainly adds not only a warm personal touch to the current rapport between the two countries, but also confidence that the two countries have a shared will to consolidate, enrich and upgrade their already close relations. The two neighbors have good reasons to get closer, not only are they both at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation, their economies are complementary and there is great potential to be tapped from docking their respective development strategies. Also the less than favorable political trends in the international area call for closer coordination between Beijing and Moscow. Particularly since Washington, despite suffering more in imagination than reality, has openly identified both as strategic rivals and potential threats. The Cold War mindset that characterizes the current US administration has found expression in a confrontational and zero-sum approach to major-country relations that goes against the trends of the times. By working together to build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, cooperation and all-win results, China and Russia are showing that major-country relations do not have to be defined by winner-take-all competition. In addition to convincing the US and its allies of the nonthreatening, constructive potentials of their increasingly closer partnership, Beijing and Moscow can work together to provide a sense of stability to counter the uncertainty created by the capricious actions of the Trump administration, and help show the benefits of forging a community with a shared future, something that President Xi Jinping has urged all countries to strive and build. By continuing to advance their friendly relations, Beijing and Moscow provide an antidote to Washington's fixation on a dangerous past.         "
"US should come to its senses, stop pushing for trade war: China Daily editorial",3/19/2018,"                      Along with the package of tariffs and investment restrictions it is reportedly planning as punishment for what it alleges are China’s violations of US intellectual property laws and pressuring of US companies to transfer technology, the Trump administration is also considering limiting the number of visas issued to Chinese students, according to The Wall Street Journal. The move comes after the director of the FBI accused Chinese students and researchers in the United States of being covert information collectors, spies in other words, and after Washington announced it will impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China. So far, Beijing’s response to these moves has been rather subdued. Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui said recently that China will take “necessary measures” if its interests are harmed, but knowing how important a healthy trade relationship is to the bigger picture of bilateral ties, Beijing has so far chosen to keep its powder dry in the belief that once the rain has gone the sky will brighten. For it hopes that the Trump administration will come to its senses and realize that the unilateral measures it is proposing to take against Chinese imports stand little chance of hurting China without harming the US, since the cost-advantaged imports the tariffs target benefit US manufacturers in upstream industries and US consumers. The restrictions on students’ visas, meanwhile, as well as giving substance to suspicions that are so far-fetched and unfounded they hint at paranoia, will also be counterproductive, given that Chinese students account for about one-third of the 1.1 million international students enrolled in US universities. Ironically, given Washington’s fixation on its trade deficit with China, the US actually has a surplus in education, an industry that is worth tens of billions of dollars to the US. Chinese students and scholars, who contribute so much to US science and innovation, are simply being made scapegoats in the Trump administration’s confrontational reframing of the US’ engagement with China. In contrast to the shortsightedness of its politicians, much of the business community in the US has remained clear-minded and it is cautioning Trump that by upsetting the nest he risks breaking the eggs for everyone. Trump should heed these words of caution and stop trying to blame others for ills that are of the US’ own making. It is 10 years since the shock waves of the subprime crisis in the US spread around the world and the global economy is only now beginning to recover. The ever-growing interdependence between the world’s top two economies means tit-for-tat trade blows between them would create even greater risks for themselves and the global economy.         "
Pompeo no brake on Trump,3/19/2018,"                          File photo of Mike Pompeo. [Photo/Agencies]   Even a Twitter-holic such as Donald Trump will no doubt be aware that firing someone by tweeting his dismissal will be embarrassing for the person ousted from his job. And yet he did it.  Even if the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson knew his days in office were numbered, it was humiliating for him to lose his job in such a way, especially since he was on an official trip overseas.  To some extent, Trump was probably repaying the embarrassment caused him by his top diplomat, since Tillerson was vocally at odds with him on many issues.  About 35 officials holding key posts have left the White House since Trump's inauguration, including some of his erstwhile allies. No more evidence is needed to prove that what Trump seeks is not unity but subservience.  If Tillerson's successor Mike Pompeo is to avoid his predecessor's fate, he should act as a mouthpiece echoing the president and seek to help materialize his boss' words.  Pompeo has won Trump's trust through close contact with the president in his role as CIA director, and has reflected the president's stance on issues that sowed discord between his predecessor and the president.  Although, as many cases have shown, Pompeo is a man of strong and outright views, he has never ever put a foot wrong by saying anything that might upset Trump.  Pompeo has no choice but to act as a loyal executor of Trump's directives if he wants to avoid the fate of his predecessor, as any going off-course might irritate Trump. This will greatly embolden Trump in going his own way as they will be nobody to suggest an alternative course of action.         "
Act of folly to encourage Taiwan secessionists,3/19/2018,"                      Now that US President Donald Trump has signed into law a bill that encourages the United States to send officials ""of all levels"" to Taiwan to meet their ""counterparts"" on the island, and vice versa, the precious predictability consecutive past US administrations cautiously sought to preserve in China-US relations may soon be a thing of the past.  The current US president has a penchant for trying to profit from unpredictability. But it is foreseeable that the uncertainties caused by the so-called Taiwan Travel Act will harm his country's relations with China and do a disservice to the efforts the two countries have made over the decades to build friendly relations on the bedrock of the three communiques that normalized ties.  While most agree Trump's latest move is a provocation to Beijing, many in the US and elsewhere seem to believe the law's ""nonbinding"" nature will not instigate an immediate change in bilateral ties and view it as just another tool the Trump administration is hoping to use to pressure Beijing for more concessions in trade talks.  However, China's Foreign Ministry is taking the matter a lot more seriously and has made strong representations to the US, as it severely violates the one-China policy, the political foundation of the China-US relationship.  If the Trump administration views the island as a winning piece in its competitive game with what it regards as a ""strategic rival"", it is in for a rude awakening. As Beijing has said on many occasions and expressed in terms that could not be any clearer, Taiwan is a matter of reunification left over from history and is thus an internal affair that brooks no interference from outside.  For all its dismay at the folly of the move, Beijing may continue to try to avoid confronting Washington up front. But that does not mean it will meekly swallow the bitter pill of the US breaking its agreements in this way. Especially, since in doing so, it is sending ""very wrong signals"" to the secessionists in Taiwan.  The country's Anti-Secession Law obligates the government to resort to ""non-peaceful means"" if any major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur. And since those pursuing the island's ""independence"" have interpreted the US' move as support for their determination to challenge the mainland. Trump and his advisors should be aware that they intend to lead them a merry dance in their misguided attempts to achieve their impossible aim.  The prospect of a military response from Beijing to reunify the island with the motherland should its redline be crossed, which has been talked about lately, should not be casually dismissed.  Instead of seeking to continually prick Beijing, the US should blunt its sharp points and honor its commitments so that the complications of history can be peacefully unraveled.         "

Most of the proposals are solution-oriented, which points to the nature of the CPPCC National Committee as the country's top political advisory body and the focus of China's political system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation.  With Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and other theoretical innovations written into the Constitution, the CPPCC National Committee, which comprises political advisors from various political parties, people's organizations and of all ethnic groups, has been endowed with a historic mission to put forward proposals on how the wisdom and energy of the entire nation can be harnessed to realize the two centenary goals: The mission to build China into a moderately prosperous society by the year 2021, which is the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, and build China into a prosperous, democratic, culturally-advanced, harmonious and beautiful socialist modern country by the year 2049, which marks the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.  It will be no easy job to realize those two goals, which to be attained require the concerted efforts of all Chinese people under the leadership of the CPC.  This is where the CPPCC plays a very important role, as not only should its members raise awareness of Party and government policies, they should also spare no efforts in conducting fact-finding missions to identify the root causes of the problems in their particular fields or sectors.  Only when they immerse themselves with the people at the grass roots in a down-to-earth manner will they be able to find out where the real problems are and speak of what people feel. For it is the CPPCC's role in the country's ""new type of party system"" to determine the troubles people face and seek redress.  Just as new CPPCC National Committee Chairman Wang Yang said in his speech at the closing meeting, all CPPCC members should work to make the attitude of truth-seeking and pragmatism prevail in the CPPCC so that they work in people's best interests.

US cannot use China as a punch bag for trade blows,3/15/2018,"                          [Cartoon by Song Chen/China Daily]   It has been said that all the vices offer at least some kind of pleasure, except for one, and Washington seems intent on proving that the only exception is envy, which causes nothing but irritation, bitterness and rage.  Although the US says it is not willfulness but necessity that is compelling its actions targeting Chinese imports, it seems to be Washington's fixation on the trade deficit between the two countries, as a barometer of their economic competition, that has prompted such emotions.  Having already announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which, given the exemptions, will likely fall heavily on those from China, US President Donald Trump is now reportedly planning to impose tariffs targeting imports of Chinese information technology, telecommunication and consumer products.  Despite all the warnings that its tariffs will prompt retaliatory actions from China and likely spark a damaging trade war, it seems the Trump administration cannot resist the temptation of trade protectionism in pursuit of US primacy, which it believes is being challenged by the economic competition playing out in a broader strategic context.  The outspoken TV personality Larry Kudlow, who the White House confirmed has replaced Gary Cohn as Trump's economic advisor, said on Wednesday that China has ""earned a tough response"" from the United States on trade, because it doesn't play by the rules.  But such a claim, whose proof is merely the words of the accuser, has become something of a catchall for the Trump administration's grievances. And it is a charge that can more justifiably be made against the US itself, since it is stepping away from the principles of reciprocity, free markets and free trade that are at the heart of the global economy.  Although it repeatedly espouses these doctrines, it is exploiting their benefits by only adhering selectively to the rules and agreements.  China has sought to remedy the US' preoccupation with the trade gap and resolve their differences through negotiations aimed at agreeing on reciprocal actions to achieve mutual benefits, and that still remains the case.  However, that does not mean that it will allow itself to be the target for the arrows of adversity with which the US wants to put it at a disadvantage.  Now the trade volume between the world's top two economic powerhouses has exceeded $580 billion, China has ample arrows of its own with which to fight back.  It should be borne in mind that even the most playful cat will scratch if you provoke it beyond a certain point.         "

US foreign policy set to a hawkish wavelength?,3/14/2018,"                          File photo of Mike Pompeo. [Photo/Agencies]   Abrupt as it was, United States President Donald Trump's dismissal of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state came as no real surprise. There has been speculation for a long time about a parting of ways, as the entire world witnessed them differ on Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Paris climate agreement, among other things.  Thanks in part to what Trump described as a ""different mindset"" and ""different thinking"", Tillerson often seemed at odds with his boss during his 14-month tenure. Many believe his replacement, CIA director Mike Pompeo, will at least speak as one with the president on US foreign policy, something Trump seems to be counting on to get his way, saying they ""have a very similar thought process"" — words that will sound ominous to many given some of Trump's previous remarks and his country's habit of hasty action.  While coherence may seem an upside, it will be quite another story if the new secretary of state is simply a yes-man enabling impetuous deeds in pursuit of a set agenda.  Pompeo's hawkish stance toward China, along with his military background, have already alerted US foreign policy watchers here to the likelihood of further frictions ahead, given the differences that already exist in bilateral relations and the complexity of many issues on which they have divergent views.  This may not necessarily put China and the US on a collision course. But bilateral ties may get rockier at the hands of a combative and bombastic Trump and Pompeo double act.  In his farewell speech, Tillerson left the White House and his successor with a question that needs serious deliberation: How should the two countries deal with one another over the next 50 years to avoid conflict?  China said on Wednesday that it hopes to continue working with the US on hotspot issues and urged that relations not be viewed as a zero-sum game.  Certainly, right now, the two countries need to continue to communicate and work together with other parties to secure the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Although there are already concerns that the hawks have taken over US security and foreign policy decision-making and what that might entail.  However, while the intended audience might be taken in by appearances, it will be better to concentrate upon the details as they unfold, rather than trusting to general impressions.

Institutional reform plan will improve governance,3/14/2018,"                          The fourth plenary meeting of the first session of the 13th National People’s Congress is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday. State Councilor Wang Yong delivered an institutional restructuring plan of the State Council. Also at the meeting, Li Jianguo, vice­chairman of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People’s Congress, spoke about the new draft law on national supervision. FENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILY   The Institutional Reform Plan of the State Council, China’s Cabinet, was submitted to the ongoing first plenary session of the National People’s Congress for deliberation on Tuesday, initiating the process for the restructuring of government so that it better meets the nation’s needs for progress and development.  The proposed revamp will modernize China’s system and capacity for governance, and better leverage the ruling Party’s proven leadership, guidance and coordination capabilities by strengthening its ability to clarify the big picture of the country’s overarching objectives, draw up the plans for how to accomplish them and design and implement policy to successfully attain them.  In the past nearly four decades since 1982, the State Council institutions have been reorganized seven times to better adapt them to changes that have been brought about by the country’s economic development and social progress. But none has been as far-reaching as the proposed changes this time.  The arrangement, which cuts 15 ministerial or vice-ministerial level departments under the State Council and regroups some supervisory bodies, underlines that the Party is shouldering the responsibility to exercise leadership over all areas of the country’s endeavor to build a modern society.  The country has made tremendous achievements in both economic development and social progress over the past five years since the current Party leadership took over the helm, but at the same time, some government departments have proved unable to fulfill their roles in forestalling and defusing risks and advancing much-needed reforms.  This has often been because of an unclear division of responsibilities, so it is noteworthy that the plan aims to end the existing situation in which a department plays the role of policy planner, implementer and supervisor simultaneously.  The changes are meant to establish a sound mind in a healthy body by making the government departments and regulators more solution-oriented so that they can better diagnose problems and thus more effectively treat them.  At the same time, to better ensure that the top level governance is clean and efficient, a draft supervision law was submitted for a third reading to the national legislature on Tuesday. If approved, the bill will see new supervisory commissions established at the national, provincial, city and county levels to serve as the fundamental guarantee for the supervision of power.  The currents of time will not be stilled, both China and the world are in the midst of profound and complex changes, and the consolidation of Party and State leadership is essential if the country is to successfully grasp the opportunities of what remains an important period of opportunity for its development.

New aid agency displays resolve for shared growth,3/13/2018,"                          A part of a highway project that a Chinese company is helping to build in Algeria. Photo by Xinhua   With China’s foreign aid continuing to increase along with its growing global reach, the announcement on Tuesday that an international development cooperation agency is to be set up as part of the restructuring of government departments is noteworthy but not undue.  According to the plan submitted to the country’s top legislature, the new agency will help enhance the strategic planning and coordination of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance, which is now mainly the work of the ministries of commerce and foreign affairs.  It will also enable China to clarify that it seeks to promote the self-reliance and resilience of the recipients of its assistance, and never imposes any political conditions on its aid or seek to use it as a means to interfere in the internal affairs of recipient countries.  This is much needed, because even though it upholds the principles of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefits and win-win results in providing foreign assistance, the lack of information about its aid has left room for suspicions to be raised about its motives. Some critics in the West accuse it of being a “rogue donor”, claiming it uses aid to support authoritarian regimes in return for access to their countries’ natural resources  But the facts speak louder than words. China has been a long-time friend of developing countries and it has remained staunch through times of adversity. Now as the world’s second-largest economy, China is fulfilling its international responsibilities by providing help so countries can thrive and their peoples live better lives.  And thanks to its own economic development, China has never been closer to the center stage in world affairs. So that now, as well as providing material assistance, it is sharing its wisdom and experience in poverty alleviation and development, which has been welcomed by countries around the world, as demonstrated by those along the ancient Silk Road trade routes that have enthusiastically embraced the Belt and Road Initiative.  Even though it is known that poverty and need cause anger and these lead to strife and wars, benevolence is all too often stifled by selfishness. Friendship can bring people together and overcome all these problems, which is why international development cooperation is at the heart of the community of shared future for all humankind that President Xi Jinping has proposed.  The establishment of the new agency marks a new phase in China’s efforts in that regard.         "
Tillerson's trip shows how US misreads Africa,3/12/2018,"                          File photo of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. [Photo/Agencies]   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described his five-nation African visit, which started on Wednesday, as a “listening tour”. The purpose of the visit, he said, “is to listen to what the priorities of the countries here on the continent are and see where there is good alignment”.  It’s a welcome attitude that can help mend US-African ties after President Donald Trump’s disrespectful remark toward African countries in January. But a little homework might have made his fact-finding trip more productive, given his tight schedule.  African people have made clear what they consider to be the priorities. For a continent that is home to 75 percent of the world’s poorest countries, and where more than 1 million people, mostly children under the age of 5, die every year from malaria, what is needed is economic development, improved infrastructure, more jobs and health programs.  China has been working for years to try to meet Africa’s needs, helping African countries build railways, bridges and ports, while providing them with other forms of assistance. That is why most African countries have sought to forge a partnership with China. “No country can develop itself without having a strong infrastructure. And China is, from that perspective, a very good partner,” as Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf said on Friday.  The United States favors different solutions to Africa’s problems, being largely engaged through foreign aid. US investment in the continent has been on the decline, so it is viewed as withdrawing from Africa while China has been increasing its engagement.  This may explain why the US cannot win consent from African countries when it points an accusing finger at China for almost anything.  Only he who wears the shoes knows whether they fit, as the saying goes. African people are smart enough to know what they need most.  It is time the US started to listen to them, rather than seek to speak for them.  African countries are seeking to realize peace, stability and development and that serves not only the interests of Africa, but the common interests of all countries. The international community should support it in this endeavor. China is playing its part and it welcomes more countries making positive inputs to support African countries’ efforts to pursue development.         "
Beijing will continue its support for engagement,3/12/2018,"                          President Xi Jinping meets in Beijing on Monday with Chung Eui-yong, the top national security adviser to Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in. Chung briefed Xi on his denuclearization talks in Pyongyang and Washington. [Photo/Xinhua]   Expectations that a face-to-face meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un will put an abrupt end to the impasse on the Korean Peninsula will likely prove premature. But it is a necessary step in the required direction.  Trump has received criticism at home for accepting Kim’s invitation, which is to be expected. But he deserves praise for giving it a go. At least it is better than him trading insults with Kim. And he is certainly upbeat, and confident he can accomplish what was impossible for past US administrations. There is good reason for him to feel that way, since US-DPRK relations have deteriorated to such a degree that any slight thaw in relations between the two is welcome.  Especially since Pyongyang saw the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as an opportunity to warm relations with Seoul and the two have rapidly melted the long-standing chill on the Korean Peninsula.  Yet even if the meeting between Trump and Kim does go ahead, what happens next will probably be protracted haggling. After all, Pyongyang will not give up its nuclear weapons for nothing. Kim is likely to raise Pyongyang’s desire for a peace treaty, along with establishing diplomatic relations, while Washington will not recognize the long hostile regime in Pyongyang without denuclearization.  But that is precisely what Beijing, whose active support and contribution to fostering the talks was praised by Republic of Korea national security director Chung Eui-yong who is visiting China to brief Beijing on the recent inter-Korean talks, has persistently urged both Pyongyang and Washington to discuss directly.  No wonder it sees the latest development as being “in the right direction”, and as President Xi Jinping told Chung on Monday, it will continue to facilitate such engagement.  Xi urged all parties to be patient and use their political wisdom to address and resolve their problems.  Certainly the anxiety and discord that had previously found expression in the rancorous exchanges of outrage and insults between Trump and Kim need to be put on the back burner if any positive outcome is to materialize from a meeting between the two leaders.  Since all stakeholders say they seek a political solution to the longstanding security threat, this is a precious opportunity that should not be wasted.         "
Support for amendments belies naysayers' prejudice: China Daily comment,3/11/2018,"                      The draft amendments to the Constitution that had been proposed were formally adopted by an almost unanimous vote at the ongoing plenary session of the 13th National People's Congress on Sunday. The changes have been rightly recognized as necessary to provide surety for the nation's progress by advancing law-based governance and upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. They are of great significance to ensure prosperity and the lasting security of the nation. The constitutional revisions enshrine what the ruling Communist Party of China has accomplished in the recent development of its praxis and theory by giving Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era constitutional authority. Nobody can know better than the Chinese people themselves that the changes to the Constitution reflect the Party's current understanding of China's reality and its overall plan for the country's development in the near future. That's why Chinese lawmakers, political advisors and the public have voiced firm support for the constitutional amendments, which are in accordance with the times, the demands of the country's development and the aspirations of both the Party and the people. Yet although all this should be self-evident, we know from experience that it will invariably prove capable of bearing some other interpretation by those who seek to disparage and denigrate China, and in particular its political system and ruling Party. It has already become a habit for some in the West to speak ill of China's political system. Although they should be naturally endowed with reason and inclined to use it, whenever it comes to China they choose to look at it through tainted glasses. The constitutional revisions are meant to give full play to the advantages of China's political system by consolidating the CPC's governance capabilities. This institutional arrangement, including that on the tenure of the president and vice-president, is conducive to upholding and strengthening the overall Party leadership, improving the Party's governance of the country, and safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee as well as its centralized and unified leadership. It does not mean the end of the retirement system for Party and State leaders, nor does it imply lifetime tenure for any leader. Yet some people in the West insist otherwise, even though it is only through specious speculation that they claim to know better. These naysayers casually disregard the fact that China's political system has developed and is evolving in accordance with the country's unique national conditions. Instead, they revel in their ignorance of China's reality and hold fast to their mean, even malicious predisposition toward China's political system out of their irrational, subjective and unprofessional ideological bias. Yet, their deep-rooted ideological bias has led them to make one failed prediction after another about China. Their erroneous judgments are only a litany of short-sighted calumnies against the Party and the nation. Those Western politicians and media speaking ill of China this time are again showing how much they have staked in the inertia of their outdated thinking and how reluctant they are to put an end to their sport. Their desire is to impose upon China the political standards with which they are familiar and which favor their interests. Believing that the truth entails a loss to themselves, they have no compunction about making false claims and consider it excusable to speak so dishonorably. They can only look at China's politics through a prism of ideology rather than in an objective manner, and thus they cannot make sensible judgments in this regard. We hope these critics without true knowledge of China can visit the country someday to learn more about it. The trend of reform and opening-up over the past four decades has justified the path the Chinese people have chosen and that the wishful thinking of the naysayers goes against the Chinese people's aspirations for continued development and better lives. What the country's leaders are pursuing is in complete conformity with the well-being of the Chinese people, and this is reflected in the amendments to the Constitution that safeguard the gains that have been made in recent years and present the potentials that lie ahead to be realized.. The amendments to the Constitution will provide a basic guarantee for China to safely navigate the challenging course that lies ahead and realize its long-anticipated rejuvenation.         "
China not afraid of trade war with US,3/11/2018,"                      China does not want a trade war, nor will it take the lead to initiate one, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said on Saturday. While that might seem soft-toned, it should not be mistaken for weakness, for as he asserted, China is capable of coping with any challenges.The escalation of the trade disputes between the world’s top two economic powers is set to disrupt normal global trade order and could result in a trade war if the US continues with its irresponsible trade policies, since it would leave China with no choice but to retaliate.The US’ lop-sided economic structure is actually behind its current pile-up of trade deficits. While it excels in highly profitable high-tech and financial industries, its manufacturing is less competitive.In the case of the Sino-US trade gap, statistical errors account for about 20 percent of the US’ trade deficit with China, according to working groups from both countries. Another factor is that the US forbids exports of a large number of high-tech products to China. Given the high value of those products, it is estimated that allowing these exports would reduce the deficit by about 35 percent.It is thus unreasonable for US politicians to continue to hype the fiction that the US’ deficit with China is because the latter resorts to unfair trade practices.However, Washington’s trade policy regards economic prosperity at home as necessary to promote US power and influence abroad. Therefore, the Donald Trump Administration is eager to aggressively target economic competitors such as China. The US should be aware that if it continues to engage in protectionism and other unfair trading practices it will find that China is fully capable of defending its interests.The US will also be a loser if there is a trade war.            "
'China threat' theory should be laid to rest,3/8/2018,"                          Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi answers questions on China's foreign policies and foreign relations at a press conference on the sidelines of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing, capital of China, March 8, 2018. [Xinhua/Xing Guangli]   Recently the phrase ""sharp power"" has become fashionable in the West when talking about China's efforts to build its image overseas. But as a Chinese saying goes, this is new wine in an old bottle, since it is nothing but another twist on the ""China threat"" theory that has long gone stale.  As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a news conference on the sidelines of the annual session of the country’s top legislature on Thursday, those who do not have bias or practice double standards will not see China as a threat.  To drive home his point, Wang stressed the path of China's development over the past decades has been peaceful, and it now contributes more than 30 percent of the world's economic growth and is the largest contributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions among all the permanent members of the UN Security Council. All of which should have served to dispel suspicions about its intentions.  However, those who claim that China is a threat remain impervious to such facts. Instead, in their eyes, the Belt and Road Initiative, which has been proposed by China as a way to boost trade and connectivity among nations along the ancient Silk Road trade routes across Asia, Europe and Africa, is merely part of Beijing's diabolical plan to rule the world.  Even though nothing could be further from the truth, they cling to the belief that a rising power like China is bound to want to change the existing order and thus cast doubt on any win-win arrangements between China and other nations.  For them, the Cold War is not yet over, and they view everything through the lens of zero-sum geopolitics. It is because they cling to this mentality rather than exercise judgment that they are unable to relinquish the habit of telling others what is right while they themselves persist in doing wrong. Thus they claim that China is not conducting a traditional soft-power charm offensive but rather seeking to distract and manipulate in its bid for influence, when in reality it is they that are resorting to such sharp power to denigrate China.  Those willing to view China objectively will look for the real truth of the matter rather than accept unquestionably the imagining of it by those unwilling to let go of the familiarity of the past.

Attempts to make trouble in South China Sea will fail,3/8/2018,"                      The PLA air force planes are seen conducting training exercises, Nov 19, 2017. The PLA air force recently conducted a combat air patrol in the South China Sea and conducted training exercises after passing over the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait. [Photo/Xinhua]   Foreign Minister Wang Yi's warning that provocation from outside the region constitutes the biggest disturbance to the serenity in the South China Sea is a timely reminder that continued efforts are needed to maintain the stable and peaceful situation in the waters.  Speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing National People's Congress annual session on Thursday, Wang said China will join hands with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to allay the effects of the disruptions so that the South China Sea can continue to be a sea of peace and cooperation.  Thanks to the concerted efforts of China and the members of ASEAN, tensions have greatly abated and calm has prevailed in the waters over the past two years. And China and the ASEAN countries held the first consultation on the text of a Code of Conduct for the waters a few days ago after endorsing the framework for the code of behavior last year.  However, despite such hard-won progress, while the tree craves calm, the wind will not abate, as a Chinese saying goes.  Some countries from outside the region, the United States in particular, keep trying to throw a spanner into the smooth progress of the regional consensus that peace and stability in the South China Sea cater not only to the interests of China and ASEAN, but also others who depend on its shipping lanes for trade.  Disregarding the region's clarion call for cooperation, under the pretext of upholding freedom of navigation, the US has repeatedly sent warships to the disputed waters in the South China Sea, where their intrusive and accident-prone operations pose a threat to shipping and unnecessarily put the region on edge.  And the US not only insists on pursuing such a hazardous course itself, it is also urging its allies to weigh anchor and join it. The United Kingdom, ever eager to do its bidding, is sending an anti-submarine frigate through the South China Sea later this month.  For those who still believe the US is willing to play a constructive role in the region, it is high time they awoke to the bitter truth that its intention is to fan the fires of discord and it does not intend to let those fires be extinguished by others.

Constitutional changes will enhance governance,3/7/2018,"                      The significance of the draft amendments to China's Constitution submitted to the top legislature for deliberation should not be underestimated, given they will advance law-based governance and modernize China’s governance system. Deputies to the annual session of the National People's Congress started reviewing and discussing the proposed amendments, the first in 14 years, on Wednesday and will cast their votes on Sunday. Besides the proposed enshrining of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the fundamental law of the country, what is also noteworthy is the proposed amendment to include the leadership of the Communist Party of China as ""the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics"". Although this is nothing more than a straightforward acknowledgment of China's reality. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a phrase that epitomizes this country's economic development and social management, as well as the institutional reforms introduced over the past four decades. It is the result of a long sequence of shared experiences, efforts and endeavors under the leadership of the CPC. There is no denying that the CPC's overall leadership has played an irreplaceable and vital role in this country's achievements in all conceivable aspects. Thus writing this clause into the Constitution would not only recognize that reality, it would also explicitly point to the intrinsic association between the CPC's leadership and the country's future accomplishments. Furthermore, approval of this amendment would institutionalize the CPC's core role in the country’s endeavor to realize national rejuvenation. What is closely related to this amendment is the revision of the clause stipulating that the president and vice-president serve no more than two consecutive terms (five years for each term). This revision is meant to consolidate the CPC's governance of the country and give full play to the advantages of China's political system. It by no means ends the retirement system for Party and State leaders, neither does it imply lifetime tenure for any leader. And the draft amendment to give the planned national supervisory commission constitutional status speaks volumes for the current leadership's resolve to fight against corruption. As China has entered a new era, its guiding theory, system and institutions need to adapt to the changed circumstances.

[Photo/Agencies]   Ahead of his first official visit to Sub-Saharan Africa, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confessed that the continent's rapid economic growth and fast-rising population mean the United States views Africa's future as ""increasingly linked"" to its own.  Which is no doubt why he felt the need to issue a warning to the host countries about China's growing political and economic influence on the continent, something he also did last month before his visit to Latin America.  While partnerships with his country promote ""good governance"", those with China ""encourage dependency"", he said. In his words, Beijing is entrapping African governments with ""opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt"".  Yet Tillerson's conversations with his African hosts may not be as agreeable as he seems to believe. Besides dealing with the ill feelings that US President Donald Trump provoked with his derogatory reference to African countries in January, Tillerson will have to convince his hosts of the good his government can do and convince them of the harm he alleges China is doing.  Trump's disrespect aside, Tillerson will have a difficult time demonstrating his government’s claim of commitment to African development. Eight US embassies in Africa, including those in South Africa and Egypt, have no ambassadors. Tillerson himself just submitted a 2019 budget request that cuts US health programs in Africa by one-fifth and diplomatic programs by more than a third. That does not indicate the US' closer engagement is in the interests of African countries, rather the opposite. His announcement of $533 million in humanitarian assistance to ""fight famine and food insecurity"" in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Lake Chad Basin, merely highlights how the region is being factored into the US’ security and economic growth strategies.  As to Tillerson's accusations against China, the Tuesday testimony of General Thomas Waldhauser, head of US Africa Command, offers an effective rebuttal.  The Chinese presence in Djibouti is welcomed by locals, he told US lawmakers: ""The Chinese are building facilities, they are building a shopping mall, they built a soccer stadium, they have built the infrastructure for communications.""China even brought a hospital ship off Djibouti to provide basic care for local people.  China has long shown its support to Africa, and this has been warmly acknowledged by African countries.         "
Hopes for Korean Peninsula progress should be nourished,3/6/2018,"                            Chung Eui-yong (second right), head of the presidential National Security Office, and Suh Hoon (left), chief of the ROK's National Intelligence Service, prepare to leave for Pyongyang at a military airport south of Seoul on Monday. JUNG YEONJE / AFP     The ""openhearted talk"" between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un and envoys for the Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang on Monday marks major progress in efforts to defuse the tensions on the Korean Peninsula after more than a year of verbal exchanges between Pyongyang and Washington threatening war.  That it is the first time Kim has met any ROK officials in person since he took power in late 2011 raises the hope the rapprochement this time may not just be a repeat of the thaw-to-tension cycle that has been witnessed before.  Thus it is welcome news that Kim's call for a summit meeting to promote ""dialogue, contact, cooperation and exchange"" during his four-hours with the ROK envoys has been accepted by Seoul.  Pyongyang cannot blame others if the concrete steps it has been taking lately to improve inter-Korea ties, including its participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the ROK last month, are greeted with a degree of caution, as the world has seen it extend the olive branch before only for it to continue with its nuclear and missile programs afterwards.  But this time there is a difference as the head of the ROK delegation stated on Tuesday that Pyongyang said it had no need to possess nuclear weapons if there is no military threat against it, and it explicitly expressed its willingness to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, a willingness the world wants to see it act upon.  It has made it clear it considers such weapons a necessity for survival — something that US President Donald Trump's talk of ""fire and fury"" only served to reinforce, recalling as it did the US’ saturation bombing of the DPRK during the Korean War. The annual joint military drills between the US and the ROK, postponed for the Winter Olympics and set to resume later this spring, also serve to amplify Pyongyang's existential angst.  Washington should not believe that by simply possessing such weapons the DPRK will incite violence against the United States. What Pyongyang wants is a peace treaty and security guarantees.  Instead of threats and war drills, the US needs to realize that to promote peace requires it to demonstrate to the DPRK a disposition of benevolence that can overcome Pyongyang’s mistrust and belief that the US' real aim is regime change.  Washington should take its cue from the outcome of the meetings between Kim and the ROK envoys and seize this opportunity as the best way to prevent the rhetoric of war being realized.         "
History shows it ain't that easy to win a trade war,3/6/2018,"                      China is used to bearing the brunt of Washington's beggar-thy-neighbor trade protection measures. But now, as the United States threatens to impose high tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products across the board, all its major trade partners will feel the pain, which would lead to a series of repercussions that will affect the US' own interest, disrupt the global trade order, and ultimately risk derailing the world economy. Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariff plan, many of the country's biggest trade partners, including some of its traditional allies, have protested strongly against the move and warned they will take countermeasures. Brazil has already filed a protest with the World Trade Organization against the proposed tariffs and urged the White House to reconsider them. And Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom have all expressed concerns about the US move and promised retaliatory measures. Some leading US congressmen and corporate interests have also urged the White House to stop such unilateralist moves for fear of them backfiring, since the imposition of the tariffs will harm not only the industries in other countries but also those US industries that rely on imports of steel and aluminum. It seems that not everyone is sufficiently astute to be able to view things from the right perspective and realize that protectionism destabilizes the global economy. There are no losers, only winners in global trade. If the global trade growth momentum is disrupted it will make all countries losers, including the US. Last year, global trade registered 2.4 percent year-on-year growth, up from 1.3 percent in 2016, according to WTO estimates. The global trade recovery, however, remains fragile and the US’ protectionism will only create adversarial stances that serve to impede it. While it might initially glory in small gains, the Trump administration will come to grieve the greater losses, for if it continues to act in such a manner, its actions will end up weighing heavier in a balance that is not in the US’ favor. The argument against tariffs and trade barriers has been proved in the real world where free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries lag behind. Trump has claimed that winning a trade war is easy. If he persists in pursuing one, he will soon find out the hard way that is not the case.         "
Defense budget hike is not out of the ordinary,3/5/2018,"                      China's defense budget has become a lightning rod for those keen to claim there is a threat from China, for whatever reason. This year has been no exception, with the announcement that China's defense budget is to grow by 8.1 percent prompting finger-pointing from the usual suspects. And apart from labeling it as alarmingly high, some Western observers and media are claiming it reflects China’s increasing assertiveness in the East and South China seas. But although the 2018 defense budget will be 1.11 trillion yuan ($175 billion), the reality of the matter is the increase, though up from last year’s 7 percent, is still relatively low compared with many countries in the world. China's defense budget is neither the largest in size — it accounts for just one-fourth of the military spending of the United States — nor does it have the fastest growth rate. And if calculated in per capita terms, China’s military lags well behind other major countries. As to accusations of China's rising assertiveness in the East and South China seas, that is a denial of the truth, as China is merely trying to stand up for itself and its rights. The country has seen its maritime interests being increasingly infringed upon in recent years, and thus seeking a stronger military is natural for it to safeguard its interests and counter any threat that may materialize from the aggressive posturing of others upset by its rise. Apart from its security needs, as China's interaction with the world has grown, so too have its interests overseas. The country’s military, especially its naval forces, is being increasingly being looked upon to improve its capability and readiness to respond to emergencies, whether that be the evacuation of its citizens from countries in crisis or participating in humanitarian and rescue operations, such as the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. Whether liked or not, given the uncertainties in the global situation it is a trend of the times for military spending to be on the rise. However, there is no need to fret at China's defense budget hikes because China is committed to a path of peaceful development and it is not seeking to be aggressive in putting its interests first but rather be a builder of a community of shared future for all humankind.

Work Report signals further opening-up,3/5/2018,"                          Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers a government work report at the opening meeting of the first session of the 13th National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 5, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   As China marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up this year, the ultimate driver of sweeping changes in the country’s socio-economic landscape since 1978, there has been no lack of discussion about whether the commitment to reform and opening-up remains as firm as it used to be. However, most of the talk has been based on subjective impressions, rather than objective analysis.  To avoid the capital mistake of twisting facts to suit theories, instead of drawing conclusions from facts, those who doubt the commitment would do well to pay heed to Premier Li Keqiang’s report on government work at the opening of the first session of the 13th National People’s Congress on Monday, as it presented some clues as to what constitutes the next round of reform and opening-up in the economic realm.  According to the report, the government seeks to formulate a new pattern of opening-up this year. Specifically, it aims to create a “first-rate” business environment, completely open up general manufacturing and expand access to other sectors, open up the bank card liquidation market “in an orderly manner”, unify market access rules for Chinese and foreign banks, and replicate the experiences of free trade zones “in an all-round manner”.  In the regional context, Beijing wants to complete negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership “as soon as possible”, and accelerate efforts to forge the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area and the East Asia Economic Community.  And judging from the report, the Belt and Road Initiative is to serve as its foremost tool and platform for promoting free trade and globalization.  For all the suspicions and uncertainties surrounding the initiative, it promises opportunities for all participants to share. This is a certainty, not merely a possibility. And the all-win nature of corresponding collaboration has the guarantee of Beijing’s emphasis on joint efforts and benefit-sharing.  China’s national development has entered a phase whereby every move it makes is subject to broad scrutiny, and few escape twisted interpretations.  Yet the only way for the rest of the world to take advantage of the “China express” is to rid themselves of prejudice and see things as they are.  By reiterating its commitment to reform and opening-up, Beijing is assuring the world that it is not closing its doors. And that should be good news to all.         "
US and China can keep bilateral ties on track,3/4/2018,"                      Viewed through a pessimistic prism, it would appear that China and the United States are on a collision course, since the US has identified China as a rival and ""revisionist state"" seeking to undermine the Pax Americana. Most, if not all, recent US military deployment in the Asia-Pacific is believed to have China as a potential target, if not the target. Likewise, the trade tariffs that are being implemented by the Trump administration are regarded as aimed at China, although China is far from being the only victim. Not to mention that Washington is weighing up the merits of a proposed multilateral regime to counter-balance Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. It is not hard to see why Beijing is concerned about the way it is being perceived. It will not be easy for Beijing to convince Washington it has no intention to overthrow the US-led world order. Nevertheless, it continues to try. Although both Beijing and Washington remain reticent about the specifics of the recent visit to the US by Liu He, a member of the Communist Party of China Political Bureau and director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, Liu conveyed at least two messages vital to present-day China-US relations, namely China wants cooperation and it remains committed to reform and opening-up. Previously at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Liu promised reforms ""way beyond what people can imagine"". The Trump administration, meanwhile, is preoccupied with actual gains in dealing with China. If such attitudes persist, both parties would surely benefit from being pragmatic, and not just in trade. At a news conference preluding the National People's Congress annual session, the NPC spokesperson stressed that differences and divergences do not necessarily lead to confrontation, and he urged both sides to show mutual respect, increase strategic mutual confidence, avoid strategic misjudgment, focus on mutually beneficial cooperation, properly manage divergences, and make sure bilateral ties advance ""on the right track"". China does not want a trade war, but if the US takes actions to hurt its interests, it will take counter-measures. Washington's trade move risks leading to an adversarial economic standoff. However, given the Foreign Ministry's report of a bilateral consensus from Liu's visit on cooperation and no confrontation, it is to be hoped we can view China-US interaction more optimistically.

Two sessions can make a difference to people's lives,3/4/2018,"                      The first plenary session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held on Saturday, and the first plenary session of the 13th National People's Congress opens on Monday. People all over the country will be watching to see how the Two Sessions will affect the quality of their lives. It is natural for deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee to put forward motions and proposals on such issues as targeted poverty alleviation, on how work can be done to tighten control over food safety, on how the burden of homework on primary and middle school students can be reduced, and on how rural economy can be reinvigorated and the living standards of rural villagers considerably raised. Other issues likely to be discussed are healthcare reform, which will hopefully provide people with cheaper and easier medical service, and the campaign to crack down on organized crimes that pose a threat to social stability. The more people benefit from economic prosperity and social progress, the higher demands they have for the quality of their lives. It is not that Chinese people are fault finding, but that the country is at a turning point, where its economic development must realize a shift focus from quantity to quality and so too must its social management. That explains why socialism with Chinese characteristics was said to have entered a new era at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October. All the new targets of the Party and central government can be boiled down to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great improvement of the quality of Chinese people's lives. As a result, deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee are required to conduct more fact-finding missions to determine how specific problems affect the quality of people's lives and put forward reasonable and quality motions or proposals that can make a difference. In addition, their supervision over government work and their delivery of the people's grievances and complaints at the Two Sessions can also help improve governance. It should go without saying that there can never be too much attention paid to the details when it comes to government work. The reshuffle of the government and Party institutions, which will be a focus of this year's Two Sessions, is also meant to make government departments more efficient and reasonable in providing services. So there is reason for people to expect much of the Two Sessions.         "
US should not be baited into breaking its word: China Daily editorial,3/1/2018,"                                             In one of the joint communiqués that underpins relations between the United States and China, the two countries state their agreement that Washington can only maintain unofficial ties with Taiwan. It is this recognition that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the US' upholding of the one-China principle that have served as the foundation for ties since diplomatic relations were established in 1979. Which is why China is ""strongly dissatisfied"" and ""resolutely opposes"" the Taiwan Travel Act being approved by the US Senate, as the act breaks this agreement by encouraging exchange visits by US officials and their ""Taiwan counterparts"". All that is needed now for it to become law is the signature of US President Donald Trump. And it may be tempting for him to give his endorsement, as he may consider it a means of extracting trade concessions from Beijing in his country's favor. But unless he is ready to see the by and large stable and so-far profitable relationship derailed, unless he is determined to plunge his country into a pointless, mutually damaging altercation, or worse, he should resist the seducement. Instead, he should try his best to preserve the generally fine momentum of bilateral interaction as well as the goodwill he has accumulated with the Chinese leadership. Not everyone buys Trump's faith in his personal rapport with President Xi Jinping. But, at the very least, his pragmatic approach has been reciprocated. Even as the danger of widening trade tit-for-tat rises, both governments are demonstrating their willingness to talk to avoid a trade war. Unlike trade, though, Taiwan is a matter of sovereignty. For Beijing, it is a clearly defined core interest that is not negotiable. Trump should bear in mind that since she became leader on the island, Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party have been increasingly trying to embroil the US in their secessionist shenanigans. The US may believe that the agreement it made was a necessity of the past, and breaking its word an imperative of the present. But by signing the Taiwan Travel Act into law, the US leader will only encourage Tsai in her bid to portray the island as eligible for state-to-state relations. Which, if she persisted, would lead to the inevitable consequence of triggering the Anti-Secession Law that allows Beijing to use force to prevent the island from seceding. Since the US is bound by domestic law to act on behalf of the island in that instance, it would only give substance to the observation that the descent into hell is easy.         "
"Of course, China's navy is not untoward in blue water: China Daily editorial",3/1/2018,"                                             There is a Chinese idiom ""lose the axe and suspect the neighbor"" that reflects how jumping to conclusions can lead to an innocent person being the target of unfounded suspicions. That mindset is exactly what Japan is adopting in considering the deployment of a surface-to-ship missile unit on the main island in Okinawa's island chain. According to a report in the Asahi Shimbun early this week, the move is to strengthen the country's defense and serve as a check to Chinese naval vessels passing through the strategic Miyako Strait. The Japan Self-Defense Forces already plan to deploy anti-ship missiles on several other small islands near the key waterway. The latest deployment schedule will enable it to build a missile system that can cover the entire Miyako Strait, the main gateway of the Chinese navy to the Pacific. Tokyo claims the deployments are necessitated by the increasing number of times Chinese naval ships sail through the strait, ""two to five times"" each year since 2008 through 2016. It is a cunning old hand. It is actually professing indignance by making believe the knavery is of another. Under international law, there are no restrictions on Chinese naval ships sailing in the open sea. To see the normal operations by the Chinese navy as a security threat is an overreaction that says more about Japan than China. As it is now the world's largest trading nation and second-largest economy, China's economic interests that require protection have increased rapidly overseas during the past decades. In such a context, that the Chinese navy is going out is natural and something that Japan and other countries will have to get used to. Tokyo and others cannot draw a line in the sea, as they seem to believe. Instead, they will be totally misjudging China's resolve if they think the Chinese navy shall forever be contained in its adjacent waters semi-enclosed by a series of island chains and archipelagic nations. Provocative steps such as those taken by Japan to counter China's move to embrace blue water will not serve their purpose. Chinese naval vessels sail outside their home waters on goodwill visits, and to engage in humanitarian and security operations. They are doing nothing out of the ordinary that Tokyo and others should take exception to.         "
Unacceptable for Tokyo to add insult to injury again,2/28/2018,"                          Yong-soo Lee (left), 89, a South Korean ""comfort women"" survivor, poses with Julie Tang (center) and Lillian Sing (right), both co-chairs of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition, at the ceremony on Friday for the San Francisco ""comfort women"" memorial at St Mary's Square. [Photo by LIA ZHU / chinadaily.com.cn]   Film footage discovered by a team of scholars from the Republic of Korea at the US National Archives and Records Administration was released by Yonhap News Agency on Tuesday. It adds to the existing documentary evidence that the Japanese military brought 30 Korean “comfort women” with them to Tengchong in Southwest China’s Yunnan province, and that the women were killed on Sept 13, 1944, before the Japanese troops surrendered to Chinese forces.  The film was released after Japan made a formal complaint on Monday following the raising of the issue of comfort women at the United Nation’s Human Rights Council by ROK Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, who said there should be a “victim-centered approach” to the issue.  Although former ROK president Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed an agreement to resolve the issue in December 2015, as a matter of expediency to improve relations. The government of her successor, Moon Jae-in, has urged follow-up measures to the agreement because it was reached without the consent of the surviving victims.  The new evidence on the comfort women issue reinforces the case for the ROK government to renegotiate the issue with Japan.  However, Junichi Ihara, Japan's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said that Kang’s raising of the issue at the UNHRC was “totally unacceptable”.  What is really unacceptable is the repeated attempts by some in Japan to sweep under the carpet, whitewash or outright deny their country’s wartime crimes, such as the coercing of woman into sexual slavery.  Many of the women who were forced to work as slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II came from the Korean Peninsula, although tens of thousands of women were also from many other parts of Asia, including China.  The issue has repeatedly soured Japan’s relations with its neighbors in recent years because Abe has continually sidestepped offering an apology to the comfort women, and sought to wriggle away from acknowledging any unpalatable truths about Japan’s wartime activities in occupied countries.  Abe and others who have followed his lead should know the more they try to rewrite Japan’s wartime history to portray the country in a better light, the more they tarnish its image as a responsible and respectable member of the international community.

Revamping Party and govt institutions for a new era,2/28/2018,"                          Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, makes an important speech at the third plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee in Beijing, capital of China. The session was held from Feb 26 to Feb 28, 2018. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)   The approval of a structural reform plan of the Party and State institutions by the third plenary session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee, which concluded on Wednesday, is a significant move by the ruling party to give full play to the advantages of China’s socialist system to meet the needs of a new era.  The structural reform plan is intended to strengthen the Party’s leadership, improve the efficiency of State governance and overcome the institutional obstacles to reform.  Both Party and government institutions have been remodeled and restructured several times since 1978 when reform and opening-up were initiated, in order to better enable them to fulfill their intended roles and improve efficiency. Now the structural reform plan recognizes that the country is undergoing a historic shift that is creating many new demands for the work of the Party and the country.  The current structure of Party and State institutions is incompatible with the current situation and the future development of the economy, politics, culture, ecological conservation and social progress. Their revamping and revitalization is therefore crucial to the successful implementation of the country’s long-term development strategy and goals.  The restructuring of Party and State institutions is also necessitated by the urgency of the specific near-term targets of building the country into a moderately well-off society in all respects, advancing reforms, implementing law-based governance and exercising full and rigorous governance over the Party.  Building on continued efforts to sustain development, the institutional restructuring will ensure that efforts can be devoted to improving the quality and effect of reforms and policies.  Over the past five years since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in Nov 2012, the experience gained in the fight against corruption, in economic development and rule of law needs to be institutionally guaranteed.  At the same time, the lessons learned need to be taken into consideration. To be specific, the restructured Party and State departments should be better scrutinized by the planned national supervisory commission to reduce the chances of abuse of power by State and Party officials.  Improving the institutions and mechanisms to uphold the Party’s leadership and enhance State governance will manifest the central leadership’s ability and resolve to chart the country’s future course and coordinate efforts to successfully realize its modernization and rejuvenation.

Geely's Daimler deal is just a matter of course,2/27/2018,"                      It would be sad if Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding's surprise emergence on Friday as the biggest investor in Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler, with a 9.69-percent stake, becomes fuel for China phobia. A German parliamentary committee is to reportedly question government officials on whether Geely violated disclosure rules and whether loopholes in securities trading law need to be closed. Geely is not snapping up shares without consideration, it has made no secret about what it wants — access to Daimler's know-how in electric and autonomous vehicles — and in its eagerness to acquire them it has reportedly employed aggressive tactics to build the required voting stake after its earlier overture to Daimler was rejected. Although former Morgan Stanley Germany CEO Dirk Notheis is said to have been the architect of Li Shufu, Geely's founder and chairman, amassing shares in the German automaker. Geely may be an unwelcome partner to Daimler executives, who had various reasons to give it the cold shoulder. It owns rival carmaker Volvo, and Daimler already has a Chinese partner, the Beijing-based carmaker BAIC. Likewise, German market regulators may have questions about how Geely managed to acquire its stake in Daimler, even launch a probe, as the financial and markets regulator, BaFin, is reportedly doing. At the end of the day, as German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Monday, this is a business matter after all. It is a gamble, so that Geely can compete in the rapidly changing global automotive market. Geely is only one of numerous Chinese companies trying to sharpen its edge in the fierce competition in a globalized market. The Chinese government holds no stake in the listed company. Geely's business operations in China are subject to Chinese industrial policies and government regulation. While keeping an ""especially watchful eye"" on Chinese investments, the German government should not ignore this: Last week BMW announced a deal with Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motor to build electric-powered Mini cars in China for the local market, and over the weekend, Daimler announced a $1.9 billion investment into its partnership with BAIC. It's a two -way street. The suspicions that the deal will be a ""gateway"" for Chinese industrial policy interests simply show how much people prefer to cling to their positions rather than exercise rational judgment. Things do not need to be more than they are, Geely simply wants to survive the tech tsunami that is about to engulf the automotive industry.         "
Frank Sino-US talks can avert possible trade war,2/26/2018,"                          [Photo/IC]   As each other's largest trading partner, China and the United States both set great store by their trade ties. Yet with the surplus in China's favor proving an itch that US President Donald Trump can't stop scratching in his bid to achieve what he calls ""fair and reciprocal"" trade relationships, in real speak meaning they conform to his ""America first"" mantra for the voters, trade tensions between the world's two largest economies have been on the rise.  Having already imposed punitive tariffs on solar panels from China and threatening to levy a big fine for what the US alleges is intellectual property theft, Trump is also reportedly mulling punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China.  Given the increasing protectionist measures Washington has been taking since Trump took office, there has not surprisingly been talk of tit-for-tat actions leading to a possible trade war. To avoid that worst-case scenario, the two sides should take the opportunity of this week's visit to Washington by China's top economic adviser to focus on common ground and find reasonable solutions to their trade differences.  The talks between Liu He, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Trump's trade envoy Robert Lighthizer will likely serve as harbinger of how Sino-US trade relations are going to evolve in the near future.  Liu's visit, which begins on Tuesday, highlights once again that Beijing is seeking to work with Washington to tackle the trade differences between them head-on, and there is certainly much room for the two sides to cooperate to achieve more balanced trade if they demonstrate the necessary shared willingness. After all, China is the major buyer of US farm products such as wheat and soybeans, and Boeing planes, and during Trump's visit to Beijing in November, he sealed deals worth $250 billion with China.  Since then, his administration has defined the bilateral relationship as one of rivalry and competition. However, the opportunities for cooperation and the benefits that can be accrued from them should not be ignored or missed.  Frank and sincere talks with a willingness to agree on quid pro quo actions to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution are the best, if not only way, to avoid escalating retaliatory measures that would lead to a trade war that would be damaging for both.

Constitutional changes in accordance with new era,2/26/2018,"                      To maintain its good governance of the world's most populous country and to realize the goal of national rejuvenation in the coming decades, the Constitution must give expression to what the ruling Communist Party of China has achieved in its praxis and theory, its understanding of the reality of China and its overall planning for the country's development in the near future. At the 19th National Congress of the CPC, which was convened in October last year, the theoretical achievements made by the Party since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in November 2012 was summarized as Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, which is now the guideline for the development of the Party and the country's economy, and for social progress in the years to come. It is little wonder it has been proposed that this, along with some other important decisions made at the 19th CPC National Congress, including reform of the supervision mechanism, which will have a profound impact on the anti-graft fight and supervision over the exercise of power by officials at all levels, as well as other new policies and concepts, be written into the Constitution. The proposed amendments also include the revision of the clause stipulating that the president and vice-president shall serve no more than two consecutive terms (five years each term), which has been necessitated by the need to perfect the Party and the State leadership system. The strong leadership of the CPC has proved to be a decisive factor for what this country has achieved both economically and politically over the past four decades, and the Constitution has been amended four times over the past 40 years — in 1988, 1993, 1999 and 2004. All the amendments have injected new ideas and concepts about where the country will go and how it will achieve its goal of rejuvenation and ensure people live happier lives.

Australia has to match its change of words with action,2/26/2018,"                          Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia December 5, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been a prominent cheerleader for the China-bashing among Western leaders. However, when he embarked on his visit to the United States last week, he abruptly changed his tune and started to talk favorably about China.  In a joint press conference with US President Donald Trump on Friday, Turnbull stressed the economic opportunities presented by China's rise and said he and US President Donald Trump did not view the Asia-Pacific region ""through an out-of-date Cold War prism"" and do not regard China as a threat.  Turnbull's change of attitude is welcome given his previous remarks and the growing anti-China sentiment that it seemed he was allowing to fester in Australia.  Something that may have prompted Turnbull's about face since it has provoked a backlash at home, with even some former Australian leaders repeatedly urging Turnbull to discard his hostility toward China.  Turnbull may also feel the need for Australia to strike a balance between the increasingly intense competition between the US and China. After all, for a country wishing to maintain good relations with both China and the US, the best scenario for Australia would be to cooperate with both countries.  Be that as it may, if Turnbull is now choosing to look at China through a more objective prism that would obviously help build more trust between the two countries, which will only usher in a more cordial atmosphere for relations to deepenen and grow.  Yet the Australian government still needs to match words with deeds as some favorable remarks alone are not enough to dispel the deep-running bias some Australians harbor toward China.  In its most recent foreign policy white paper, Australia proposes that it can act as an honest broker between China and the US. But in order to do that it needs to demonstrate it is impartial and encourage Australian society to look at China and China-Australia ties through a fair and just prism too.         "
Trump should not be too eager to jump to the gun,2/25/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the East Room of the White House in Washington, US, Feb 23, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Targeting one Chinese individual, 27 entities and 28 vessels of China, the United States announced on Friday what its Treasury Department called ""the largest North Korea-related sanctions tranche to date"". Whose failure, according to US President Donald Trump, may lead to a ""phase two"", which he said would be ""very rough"", and ""very, very unfortunate for the world"".  In the meantime, his administration is reportedly working on a plan to significantly intensify interceptions of ships suspected of violating the UN sanctions imposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in the hope of plugging a loophole that allegedly allows Pyongyang to finance its weapons programs via maritime smuggling.  Such moves only threaten to jeopardize the current Olympic inter-Korean détente that has brought hopes of way out of the dangerous predicament on the Korean Peninsula, with the Republic of Korea saying on Sunday that the DPRK is willing to hold direct talks with the US. Those with an optimistic outlook hope such talks happen and lead to negotiations that secure a lasting peace agreement.  Well-wishers have always hoped for the best-case scenario in dealing with the DPRK nuclear crisis – resolving it within the UN framework with little pain, if any, inflicted. But the current easing of tensions, encouraging as it is, is only a window of opportunity that can shut at any moment.  While it is open it needs to be made the most of. Trump’s threats, even if intended as a pressure tactic, along with his adherence to the position that Pyongyang take concrete steps toward denuclearization first, will only slam the window closed, restarting the vicious cycle of tit-for-tat actions that had threatened to get out of hand prior to the current inter-Korean cordiality.  The UN-endorsed sanctions are the best way to encourage the DPRK to regard its nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip to get the security guarantees it needs, rather than only means of guaranteeing its security.  For those sanctions to bite, however, besides the sanctions themselves being tough enough, they have to be carried out.  Yet that does not justify Washington adopting a ""long-arm"" approach to carrying out those sanctions. The biggest pitfall to concerted efforts to put an end to the DPRK’s nuclear adventure through sanctions is for Washington to divide the international coalition by seeking to unilaterally punish entities and individuals that violate the UN sanctions rather than letting the violators be dealt with by the stakeholders concerned under domestic laws.  It has been said that wisdom consists of knowing how to distinguish the nature of trouble, and being able to choose the lesser evil. Rather than harking back to his earlier threat of ""fire and fury"", Trump should accept Pyongyang’s offer of talks and work with all stakeholders to end the crisis and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula peacefully.

Merkel's alarmist talk harks back to days of the Cold War,2/22/2018,"                          Acting German Chancellor Angela Merkel address a news conference at the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party headquarters in Berlin, Germany, Dec 18, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Since China launched its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, some politicians in the West have taken a skeptical attitude toward it, and even drummed up suspicions with their outdated ""China threat"" rhetoric. In the latest, and unexpected example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that China must not link its investments in the western Balkans to political demands at a joint news conference with Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev in Berlin on Wednesday.  Alarmist talk of such kind shows despite the close economic cooperation and frequent people-to-people exchanges between China and the outside world, prejudice against China, which stems from the stubborn persistence of the Cold War mentality, still runs high in the West.  China has long made it clear that the initiative for greater connectivity it has proposed is for the good of all. Since 2013, more than 100 countries and international organizations have responded favorably to the initiative, and Chinese companies have invested more than $50 billion in 20 countries involved in the initiative, creating 180,000 local jobs and contributing to the economic development of these countries.  Yet, political bias and prejudice against China have prevented some in the West from adopting a fair and objective attitude toward the initiative. Instead, they question China's strategic motivation, arguing the initiative is a geopolitical tool to assert regional leadership and establish a new sphere of influence.  Others resist the initiative fearing that it means the West will be the loser in the global competition. The view expressed by Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, belongs to this category. At this year's conference earlier this month, he said that a divided Europe will lose out in the face of a rising China.  Both Merkel and Ischinger should be told the practice in international relations which views relations among nations as a zero-sum game is outdated and should long ago have been abandoned.  China is dedicated to promoting lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity and building a community with a shared future for humankind.  It is high time those clinging on to the cozy familiarity of their Cold War mentality embraced the spirit of the times instead, joining hands with China in the spirit of cooperation, partnership and sharing.

McCarthyism making a comeback in the US,2/22/2018,"                            Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray waits to testify during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on ""Worldwide Threats"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, US, Feb 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies     When we learn that Chinese students and scholars were singled out as a threat to US national security at a congressional hearing on Feb 13, what comes to mind is nothing but the return of the notorious McCarthyism.  Asked by Senator Marco Rubio to comment on “the counterintelligence risk posed to US national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in the sciences and mathematics”, FBI Director Christopher Wray responded that Chinese students and scholars pose a national security threat that requires “a whole-of-society response”.  It is shocking that such a high-ranking official as the director of the FBI should make such ridiculous remarks on such an occasion, and openly display such prejudice against Chinese scientists, professors and students working and studying in the United States.  Behind such remarks is the anxiety in the US that one day China will overtake the US to become the strongest power in the world. But that is no excuse for some US politicians to tar all Chinese students with such unfounded suspicion, which will serve only to generate hostility and discrimination against them.  With all Chinese students and scholars being placed under greater scrutiny without any real justification, it is a blatant encroachment on their rights, and only brings shame on the US which likes to boast of its championing of human rights around the world.  There is also no reason for US politicians to fear that China’s rise poses a threat to their country’s supremacy. That China’s rapid economic development in the past several decades has contributed immeasurably to the prosperity of the US points to the fact that a prosperous China is playing a supporting role for the development of the US and the world at large.  Even if China catches up with the US in terms of its overall economic strength in the near future, Chinese leaders have reiterated time and again on different occasions that the country will never seek hegemony. What China intends to achieve is happier lives for its people and greater contributions to the peaceful development of the world.  The comeback of McCarthyism in the US only serves to show that it suffers more in apprehension than in reality.         "
Palestinian-Israeli peace process needs kiss of life,2/21/2018,"                          Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas speaks during a meeting of the UN Security Council at UN headquarters in New York, US, February 20, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The unpleasant exchanges on Tuesday at the United Nations Security Council between United States and Palestinian representatives was just another indication of how difficult the Middle East peace process may become.  As US UN ambassador Nikki Haley acknowledged, at the root of the present impasse was the White House’s December announcement that the United States considers Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital and will move its embassy there.  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ appeal for a new, broader framework for negotiations for Palestinian statehood derived from disappointment, which was understandable given the Palestinian Authority’s otherwise high hopes for a breakthrough under the US presidency of Donald Trump.  That, despite Trump’s pro-Israel remarks on the campaign trail, Abbas was among his earliest foreign visitors was in itself a clear sign of such hopes. It was then that Abbas praised his host as a leader committed to peace.  Now that the Palestinian Authority no longer sees Washington as a fitting peace broker, it is only natural for it to pursue a fresh approach, especially when Abbas’ claim of “absolute readiness to reach a historic agreement” is taken into consideration.  While the Palestine leader may have all but disqualified the United States as a mediator, and things look messy at this point, it is important to not look aside from the fact that all parties involved profess they remain committed to peace and to negotiations aimed at securing a lasting solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict.  Accusing the Trump White House of abdicating its commitment to a peaceful solution, Abbas told the Security Council on Tuesday the Palestinians have not “rejected negotiations” and believe talks are the only path to peace; Israeli UN ambassador Danny Danon conceded “the only way to move forward is to have direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians”; while Haley urged Palestinians to choose “the path of negotiation and compromise” and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the other day the controversial decision regarding Jerusalem “does not preclude a two-state solution”, which Abbas wants.  This might be a very weak consensus. But it is a precious ray of hope that deserves to be cherished by all parties.  Things may not get irreparable as long as the US is willing to review its Jerusalem stance and Palestine sees the former’s indispensable role in brokering lasting peace in the region.         "
"Quad's plan is damagingly divisive, despite the denials",2/21/2018,"                      According to reports citing an unnamed senior US official, Australia, India, Japan and the United States, the so-called Quad, are reportedly planning a joint regional infrastructure scheme to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative. The US official was quoted as saying that the project was on the agenda for talks between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during the latter's visit to the United States later this week. Apparently, the preferred terminology is to call the plan an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative rather than a rival. “China might build a port which, on its own is not economically viable. We could make it economically viable by building a road or rail line linking that port,” the US official was quoted as saying on Monday. If that was really what the Quad's scheme was all about, it would be welcome, as funding to expand the connectivity of Asia, Africa and Europe through improved infrastructure never seems enough. China has already invested more than $50 billion in 20 countries along the ancient Silk Road trade routes, but it welcomes other nations making their own contributions and cooperating to promote shared and sustainable growth over the long term. But whether the Quad is really interested in building new roads, high-speed railways and airports is questionable. Simply calling the plan an alternative does not mean that is its purpose. Instead, the plan is an outcome of the transition in the domestic policies of the four countries and the coordination of their strategies toward what the Trump administration has taken to calling the Indo-Pacific region. In particular, it appears to be an extension of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor being promoted by India and Japan, which serves only to highlight the shared anxieties the four countries have about China's rise and the progress of its Belt and Road Initiative. And, perhaps more pertinently, the common sense of purpose they have discovered in seeking to counter what they all seem to consider a threat to their interests. By boosting the commerce between China and the more than 60 countries involved, the Belt and Road Initiative is further shifting the center of gravity of the global economy to China. As a result, the four countries have all changed their stances toward China from engagement to strategic competition in a bid to maintain their advantages. So, rather than being an alternative, the plan being pursued by the Quad is instead intended to displace China's initiative. Yet, given the interdependence of economies today, rather than implementing a plan that would only prove to be damagingly divisive, the Quad should seek to implement one that is truly complementary to the Belt and Road Initiative, as that would be more rewarding, not only for themselves but for all.

Britain once again shows it is at US’ beck and call: China Daily editorial,2/13/2018,"                                             Despite some of them having conflicting territorial claims, countries in the region have been working hard to ensure peace and stability are maintained in the South China Sea, through which a third of global maritime trade passes, and to this effect they recently reached agreement on a framework for a code of conduct in the waters on the basis of consultation and consensus. Which has made the announcement by British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson on Tuesday that HMS Sutherland, an anti-submarine frigate, will sail from Australia through the South China Sea next month to assert “freedom of navigation” rights perplexing for some. But it is not difficult to understand why Britain should feel the need to forcefully insist on a right that is not being infringed upon, or why it should feel the need to jeopardize the goodwill and commendable momentum that has been attained in neighborly relations, since it is merely behaving as has become its habit, and is once again dancing to Washington’s tune. Since it has been unable to persuade countries in the region to join it in exerting the pressure it wants on China in the South China Sea in its bid to contain it, the United States has been casting its net wider among its allies to help it in this endeavor. And its faithful poodle has once again come barking to heel. Referring to similar US “freedom of navigation” operations in the waters, Williamson has previously said that Britain supports the US approach, and since the US was looking for other countries to do more, it offered a great opportunity for Britain “to exercise leadership”. Britain’s idea of leadership is all too often toeing Washington’s line without any ifs or buts, something that can lead to disastrous consequences as evidenced by the findings of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War, which included a memo from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to President George W. Bush in the run up to the two countries’ 2003 invasion of Iraq in which he offered him a blank check of support, saying “I will be with you, whatever”. As a consequence of this, the country’s political, military and intelligence leadership mismanaged a conflict that need never have started, the report concluded. Britain would do well to reflect that if its will is not its own then the outcomes of its actions will not be of its own intended devices nor will they satisfy their desired purposes.         "
Trump proposes fresh salvo of tariffs in his war for spoils: China Daily editorial,2/13/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump delivers a speech on tax reform after touring Sheffer Corporation in Blue Ash outside Cincinnati, Ohio February 5, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It is yet to be seen whether US President Donald Trump’s threat of a “reciprocal tax” on goods imported from countries that levy tariffs on US products was just a reiteration of his campaign trail slogans as some observers believe.  For the harm such tariffs would inflict on the world’s most important and most active trade ties, it would be better for the proposal to be what some critics assume — more bark than bite.  To this point, no details have been forthcoming, and reportedly nothing formal is in the works, although Trump promised progress “during the week and during the coming months”.  However, such influential tariffs would need the approval of Congress, and a similar idea of a border adjustment tax was shot down by congressional Republicans last year.  While Trump’s rhetoric on Monday might just be another bid to help the US in its endeavors to renegotiate trade deals, it is a costly miscalculation to underestimate the disruption he is bringing to the international trade scene.  Trump’s personal discontent with US trade relations with other nations, from China to the US’ allies and neighbors, is notoriously biased. His otherwise understandable preoccupation with reducing US trade deficits has been led astray by indiscriminate America-centrism and his overall refusal to accept widely accepted international trade protocols and practices, which are outcomes of mostly US-initiated and dominated trade negotiations under the framework of the World Trade Organization. Even the relatively low US duty structure was itself a negotiated outcome.  While blaming the present US duty structure for his country’s trade deficits, Trump is knowingly denying its historical contribution to the prosperity his country enjoys, as well as the benefits it brings to the average American consumer and business.  “A 10 percent tax on imports is akin to a 10 percent additional tax on your Walmart checkout,” says Christine McDaniel, a former trade economist at the White House.  If Trump honors his campaign promise to impose much higher tariffs on imported goods, it will significantly drive prices up for countless imported commodities, including daily necessities, making them unaffordable for ordinary Americans.  Considering the punitive tariffs his administration recently imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels, it is very likely Trump will press ahead with the “reciprocal tax”, even if not in a wholesale manner.  The US will gain little, but nevertheless its trade partners must act accordingly to protect themselves.         "
Poverty relief requires complete commitment: China Daily editorial,2/12/2018,"                          Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, visits the homes of impoverished villagers of the Yi ethnic group who live deep in the Daliang Mountains of Zhaojue county, Sichuan province in Southwest China, Feb 11, 2018. Xi asked the villagers about their lives and discussed poverty alleviation with local officials and villagers on Sunday. [Photo/Xinhua]   President Xi Jinping’s visit to Zhaojue county in Southwest China’s Sichuan province, one of the country’s most poverty-stricken counties, five days before Spring Festival, points to the importance China’s top leadership attaches to the poverty alleviation task.  It has become a regular practice for Xi, who is also general secretary of the Party Central Committee, to visit poverty-stricken rural families immediately before Spring Festival.  With such visits, he is telling officials at all levels never to forget their mission of serving the people. He is telling them to rack their brains and do whatever they can to help the remaining some 30 million poor villagers in the country out of poverty.  It goes without saying that the nearer the battle is to finally being won, the harder the fight becomes, as those poverty-stricken villagers in remote rural areas have lived hard lives for too long to muster enough will to help themselves.  The goal is for more than 10 million poverty-stricken villagers to be lifted out of poverty by the end of this year, some 200 counties should no longer be designated as poverty-stricken ones, and 2.8 million villagers should be relocated to places with natural conditions favorable for a better life.  For those officials who are taking immediate care of poverty alleviation work, it is not just a matter of giving money or building new homes for impoverished villagers. They are supposed to help poverty-stricken villagers help themselves.  Thus they can hardly do a good job unless they have committed themselves whole-heartedly to the task. Only with such commitment will they be able to fathom out where the real root cause of poverty is for a specific locality or even a specific family, and then be able to figure out a way to help the impoverished villagers help themselves.  It is important to lift all the remaining poor villagers out of poverty by the year 2020. But it is even more important to fortify them with a frame of mind that means they never reconcile themselves to living in poverty, so that they do not slip back into it. That is what the officials in charge of poverty alleviation need to achieve so that the nation’s poverty alleviation achievements are lasting.         "
US act would put it at risk of being pawn of secessionists: China Daily editorial,2/12/2018,"                      The Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages high-level exchange of visits between the United States and the island, passed the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations last week as expected, and will now move to the Senate, where it is quite likely to get the seal of approval before being sent to the president to be signed into law. But this is not a common bill. By pushing for official exchanges with Taiwan, the bill, if made into law, would signify a major shift in the US’ long-held one-China policy, which is the cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It would also embolden Taiwan secessionists as it implies that the island is already achieving the kind of statehood that they pursue. Giving credence to their ambitions would cross the red line set by the mainland in its Anti-Secession Law, which requires Beijing to employ non-peaceful means to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should those seeking “Taiwan independence” act by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China. It thus promises to set China and the US on a direct collision course given that based on the Taiwan Relations Act — itself an example of US double-dealing in handling relations with China — Washington is obliged to assist Taiwan in its defense. Despite this, it seems US politicians have an irresistible urge to set in motion a train of events that would inevitably lead to such a cataclysmic outcome somewhere down the line. The move is the result of the general atmosphere in the US, which is increasingly hostile toward China, as evidenced by the US National Security Strategy that singles out China as a rival power, and President Donald Trump’s recent State of the Union address in which he placed China alongside “rogue regimes” and terrorist groups as a “horrible danger” challenging the US’ interests, economy and values. Since it is clear that his administration is looking for ways to put China at a disadvantage, there is a real possibility the act will be signed into law. However, history shows such seemingly firm designs all too often run astray and contrary to their intended effects. Especially in such instances, when the tail can so easily wag the dog. Trump should bear that in mind if the bill is put on his desk for him to sign. On issues such as Taiwan that concern China’s core national interests, the Chinese government has no room to make any compromise, even if that means the country has to go to war. The Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages high-level exchange of visits between the United States and the island, passed the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations last week as expected, and will now move to the Senate, where it is quite likely to get the seal of approval before being sent to the president to be signed into law.

Nuclear issue still a thorn in current Korean détente: China Daily editorial,2/11/2018,"                      United States Vice-President Mike Pence went to Pyeongchang committed to foiling Pyongyang’s alleged attempt to “hijack the message and imagery” of the Olympics. He left insisting “there is no daylight” among the US, Japan and the Republic of Korea on sustaining the strategy of extreme pressure. However, the latest developments offer no clue whether that is indeed the case or not. Athletes from both sides of the 38th parallel marched into the stadium under a “Korean Peninsula” flag and sat shoulder to shoulder behind the podium, where IOC President Thomas Bach gave a sentimental eulogy to the power of unity. The ROK President Moon Jae-in promised to “make it happen” upon receiving a handwritten invitation from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un for a visit “at the earliest date possible”, and officials of the two Koreas talked for three hours over lunch, sharing soju. Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the DPRK leader, reportedly left a message expressing hope for “unification and prosperity in the near future”, and the visiting art troupe from Pyongyang stirred up another round of romantic anticipation surrounding the abrupt détente. Everything negative about the DPRK, even its military parade the day before, appeared forgotten. No wonder US media lamented the US was “left in the cold”. Indeed, even Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was found greeting Kim Yong-nam, head of the DPRK delegation. President Moon may be a little more anxious to exploit these developments than Washington would feel comfortable with. The warm welcome extended to Pyongyang officials was certainly not what the White House wanted. Moon’s suggestion that Pyongyang should seek negotiations with Washington was a fitting reminder, both to Pyongyang and the rest of the world, that inter-Korean reconciliation is difficult without engaging that crucial third party. Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington, critical as they are, have remained impossible to date because neither party appears ready to compromise and make the first move, as the US is resolutely opposing talks until the North agrees to end its nuclear program, and the DPRK is equally adamant that its nuclear capacities are non-negotiable. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped the welcome improvement in the situation on the Korean Peninsula can be sustained and built upon, rather than being allowed to slip back into the previously capricious instability.

US moves to contain China create unnecessary tensions: China Daily editorial,2/11/2018,"                      Where China-US relations go will have a bearing on not just the bilateral relations between the two major powers, but also the stability of the entire world. As such, there is enough reason for the international community to show concern about the United States’ plan to send Marine Expeditionary Units to East Asia as part of its efforts to contain China. It is hard not to see a close association between what the US has said about China in the past couple of months and its plan to deploy the marine units in East Asia. In its National Security Strategy released in December, the Donald Trump administration listed China and Russia as the biggest challenge to US power. Not long after that, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis released the US’ National Defense Strategy, which stated that “great power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of US national security”. What is even more worrying is that the US is making its case about the threat from China by pointing fingers at Beijing’s efforts to build military outposts in South China Sea and its military exercises around Taiwan. Despite the reiteration by China on many occasions that what China has done in the South China Sea is in defense in its own territorial waters and poses no threat to the freedom of navigation, the US still cites it as an excuse for its stronger military presence in the waters. As far as Taiwan is concerned, the island is part of China, and Beijing has every reason to do whatever it believes appropriate. In addition, the US has turned a blind eye to the fact that China has been working with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to successfully ease tensions in the South China Sea. It seems as though a Cold War mentality is shaping the Trump administration’s China policy, which will be detrimental to China-US relations and inevitably to regional stability and world peace at large. With China now the US’ largest trade partner and the US the second-largest trade partner of China, what both countries have achieved economically and politically over the past several decades is the result of their joint efforts to manage their differences. If the US acts on the belief that China is a rival rather than a partner and continues to try and contain China, it will only increase the tensions and uncertainties.         "
Trump's parade provokes much fretting about nothing: China Daily editorial,2/8/2018,"                                             As a president who has divided his country in an unprecedented way, Donald Trump is no doubt used to the barrage of criticism that comes his way. Nevertheless, he might still have been caught by surprise when he found himself being jeered and lambasted by critics just because he voiced his desire to hold a military parade. His directive to the Pentagon to draft options for a Bastille Day-inspired military spectacle became a target for scorn on Wednesday, with his critics deriding the idea as self-aggrandizement, even though Trump said the intention is to ""highlight the service and sacrifice of the military"". It is hard to see what all the fuss is about. It is hardly out of character for him to want to stage a military parade. Nor would it be the first time that a military parade has been held in the United States. In 1991, tanks and troops paraded through Washington to celebrate victory in the Gulf War, and few seemed too bothered. Critics argue that a parade would be a waste of money as it would cost millions of dollars. But that amount is peanuts compared to the more than $600 billion the US spends on its military each year. The attempts by his opponents to paint the military parade with ideological touches, by claiming they are exclusively for ""authoritarian"" countries, are even more far-fetched. The Bastille Day parade, which obviously made a big impression on Trump when he was visiting Paris last July, is intended to symbolize the unity, values and national spirit of France. In a word, the controversy surrounding Trump's parade plan is a typical case of opposition for opposition's sake. It is not the military parade that Trump's critics hate, but rather the fact that it will give him a moment to bask in the spotlight. The military parade itself will be no more ""crazy and insane"", as Trump's enemies have called it, than the divide over serious social issues that range from immigration policies to medical care. Trump wants to hold the military display partly to ""have a unifying moment for the country"", to show that he can bring everyone together in celebration of a strong and proud America. Yet the fierce attacks against his proposal once again expose how hard it will be to heal the wounds of a fragmented society in the ""divided states of America"".

[Photo: VCG]   The latest trade deficit figures would seem to have provided fresh ammunition for US President Donald Trump to translate into action his threats of trade remedy measures against countries with which the US has trade deficits.  The US Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that overall the US deficit in goods and services surged by 12.1 percent from 2016 to reach $566 billion in 2017, the highest level in nine years.  And the country's deficit of goods with China rose by 8 percent to hit $375.2 billion last year, which is widely expected to usher in another round of aggressive trade remedy measures by the Trump administration, since it has repeatedly vowed it would narrow the trade gap with China.  Indeed, Trump campaigned on the promise to reduce the country's high and persistent trade deficits.  Yet the question of which party benefits from a trade deficit does not have a simple answer.  For instance, the US' rising trade deficits come from its stronger economy, which last year grew by 2.3 percent, up from 1.6 percent in 2016, encouraging Americans to spend more on imported products.  The US also does not lose as much from importing goods as Trump likes to claim. The countries to which the dollar goes invest much of that money in the US securities market, which plays a significant role in stabilizing the US financial market.  Despite the trade deficit, therefore, the US has access to quality imported goods and at the same time, sees the dollar it has paid to its trade partners flow back into the US — benefits that Trump never mentions, as he stakes out a position of them versus us and an end to an era of ""economic surrender"".  At the same time, the figures also show the US posted all-time record goods exports to 29 countries, including China.  And while Trump may see tariffs as a way to reduce the deficits, China has already sent the US a demand for talks on compensation for the steep US tariffs imposed on imported solar panels and washing machines, saying the US measures break numerous WTO rules.  So further trade retaliation measures will hardly solve the US' deficit problem, instead they will wreak havoc in international trade by arousing tit-for-tat actions from its trade partners, a situation that will benefit no country.

"Falcon Heavy launch is remarkable, inspirational",2/7/2018,"                                                 A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off from historic launch pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, US, February 6, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The idea of launching into space a Tesla Roadster, playing David Bowie's Space Oddity, on a billion year elliptic Mars orbit, with the message ""made on Earth by humans"", may be more about marketing than about marking a milestone moment in our space odyssey.  Certainly many people would have thought a private company launching the most powerful rocket in the world into space, especially one that is lower in cost and reusable, would be a big enough story to make any publicity tricks unnecessary.  Elon Musk obviously thought differently, however, and his ""Starman"" is likely to live long in our collective memory.  But the accompanying razzmatazz should not detract from the launch itself, which really is something quite amazing. Also shocking in some ways, at least to the Chinese audience. Especially those who believed China had progressed to be at the forefront of space exploration, having sent astronauts into orbit.  To some of them, it is beyond imagination that the payload of the Long March 5, the strongest ever carrier rocket of China, is less than half that of the Falcon Heavy, a product of Musk's young, small SpaceX company.  ""While the Chinese slept, Americans accomplished a magnificent feat that throws China farther behind!"" exclaimed the title of an article widely reposted on China's social media.  There is nothing wrong with taking pride in our country's own accomplishments. Generation after generation of our scientists and technological workers have worked diligently, and they have indeed made conspicuous achievements, enabling the country to be a member of the elite global space club. Still it is self-deceiving to assume the country can so easily overtake one industry-leader after another or to presume that it had already become the leader itself.  The single launch of the Falcon Heavy, shows that despite all the progress made by China over the past decades, which has seen it develop the leading mobilization mechanism, it still has a lot more to learn. Not least, from the mechanisms in the United States that have encouraged and cultivated private research and development of space technology.  Now that China is promoting ""mass entrepreneurship and innovation"", the lessons the Falcon Heavy presents should not be ignored.         "
Missile defense test in pursuit of equilibrium,2/6/2018,"                                             The brief statement by the Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday announcing China successfully tested ground-based mid-course anti-missile intercept technology within its territory on Monday marks a major step forward on the People's Liberation Army's path to modernization, as only a few countries have mastered the technology necessary to intercept a missile in flight. But there is no reason for China's military modernization to be viewed as a potential threat to the security and interests of others. As the Ministry of National Defense explicitly stated, the test was ""defensive and not aimed at any country"". Given the increasingly complex and grave security situations on its doorsteps and the growing missile imbalance that is not in its favor, it would be remiss of China not to seek to restore equilibrium with its own missile defense system in face of the increasingly unfriendly geopolitical regional environment. Although Japan and the Republic of Korea have cited missile threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as an excuse for their anti-missile system deployments, that cannot disguise the truth. Rather than being for their defense, the systems are instead aimed at increasing the geostrategic pressure on China and Russia as part of the United States' strategy to pursue absolute military superiority so it can achieve absolute security for itself and its allies at the cost of the interests and security of other nations. The US has been talking a good game recently with its list of rogue states and its portrayals of China and Russia as predatory rivals and revisionist powers challenging the rules-based order. But then the biggest lies are usually told with handsomest shows of sincerity. It is the US' desire to prevent the system it created to benefit itself from being reshaped more impartially, and its unwillingness to ""surrender"" its privileged position of prosperity that are the cause of the growing global volatility. Without sustained investment to modernize its military to make it fit for the times and restore the regional balance, China would unnecessarily be inviting trouble. Only by maintaining a strategic balance and making its deterrence to military threats more capable and reliable can China safeguard its own national security and regional peace. The fact that the Chinese military took the initiative to publicize its test indicates that with fewer things to alarm it, the PLA is willing to show its confidence.           "
Shared willingness needed to extend Olympics détente,2/6/2018,"                                                 An Olympic athletes' village for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games opens in Gangneung, 237 km east of Seoul, on Feb 1, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Athletes of both sides of the divide on the Korean Peninsula are to parade together under a single flag and field a joint women's ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics, which begin in Pyeongchang, the Republic of Korea, this week.  Most impressive of all, leading Pyongyang's delegation will be the 90-year-old Kim Yong-nam, the nominal head of state of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Kim's presence alone is being read as indication of Pyongyang's seriousness about the inter-Korean rapprochement, leading many to believe what happens next in Pyeongchang will go beyond what Seoul is hoping to sell as ""Peace Olympics"".  US Vice-President Mike Pence's planned presence in Pyeongchang has also inspired some optimistic anticipations of a Pence-Kim meeting that many hope would be able to break the ice between Pyongyang and Washington and extend the Olympic detente.  After all, neither the White House nor Pence himself has ruled out such a meeting, which certainly qualifies as the ""something good"" he wished for. And who knows where a meeting like that may lead?  It would be wonderful if the detente between Pyongyang and Seoul could ultimately result in a similar thaw in ties between Washington and Pyongyang. But it is as well to err on the side of caution, since more likely than not, the latest ease in tensions on the Korean Peninsula will not bear such significant fruit.  Although Pence may not turn down a request for meeting, even talking, with Kim, his priority is to ensure Pyongyang does not ""hijack"" the games, and that the games are not exploited to undermine Washington's ""maximum pressure"" strategy.  Rather than seeking to take advantage of this window of opportunity for direct communication, Pence's visit seems intended to counter any initiatives by Pyongyang.  Washington and other stakeholders remain adamant about denuclearization as a precursor to talks with Pyongyang, but it steadfastly refuses any suggestion of that, which is why the olive branch extended by Pyongyang is viewed by Washington as a deceptive tactic to undermine international sanctions and weaken the US-ROK alliance.  Unless both sides show sincerity by making compromises to pave the way for talks of substance, the Olympics detente may not go far beyond the games, no matter how anxious Seoul is to ""make the most of it"".

No 1 document gives rural strategy flesh on the bones: China Daily editorial,2/5/2018,"                                                 A farmer of the Miao ethnic group picks coffee beans at a coffee plantation in Simao, Yunnan province. [Photo/Xinhua]   The fact that this is the 15th year in a row that the No 1 central document, an indicator of policy priority, has been devoted to agriculture, farmers and rural areas indicates how challenging rural issues are and how important they are for the country’s food security, stability and people’s well-being.  While there has been marked rural and agricultural development over the years, some pressing issues have now become prominent, including the issue of the “left-behind” elderly and children and weak grassroots governance, which has led to environmental problems, among other things.  In order to tackle such issues, in this year’s No 1 document released on Sunday, the central government has set out a package of policies aimed at setting in motion the revitalization strategy for rural areas.  This strategy was first outlined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October by top leader Xi Jinping. It aims to address the intractable issues relating to agriculture, rural areas and rural people by establishing a thriving rural economy, a pleasant rural living environment and effective rural governance.  For urban residents, a livable environment is the basis of a modern lifestyle and with the country’s development it is now often taken for granted. Yet for rural residents, it is a different story, and if it is allowed to continue, it will render the country’s modernity drive meaningless.  Take the environment, for example. Official figures suggest 3.3 million hectares of farmland in China have been contaminated with heavy metals, and nearly 200 million rural residents have no access to safe drinking water.  It is time to clean up the mess and establish better governance to ensure rural residents also enjoy the fruits of the country’s modernization. As the document points out, China cannot become modernized without modernizing its agriculture and rural areas. Only when each and every one of its more than 590 million rural residents start to enjoy the same benefits as their urban counterparts in education, medical services and the environment can they share in the dream of realizing a beautiful country.  The timetable for realizing the revitalization of rural areas was set at the central rural work conference in December, and it will require firm resolve to implement and push through the necessary reforms, as it calls for the country to eliminate rural poverty by 2020, achieve the basic modernization of agriculture and rural areas by 2035, and realize the grand goal of strong agriculture, a beautiful countryside and well-off farmers by 2050.  The policies released to begin achieving those targets include green farming, improved infrastructure and living facilities such as sanitation systems, as well as comprehensive environmental upgrading.  The document outlines the first steps in the journey to achieve this historic task for the new era.         "
Tillerson exposes US paranoia by calling China 'imperialist power',2/4/2018,"                                             In a matter of weeks, China has seen its image upgraded from the ""revisionist state"" portrayed in the United States National Security Strategy to what US State Secretary Rex Tillerson calls a ""new imperialist power"" ""reminiscent of European colonialism"". This, in the context of recent US policy statements, as was obvious in US President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address, points to a worrisome turn in the orientation of the US' China policy, something that may fundamentally change the overall picture of China-US relations. We have talked a lot about the existence of a perception gap. This is how that gap is finally rising to the surface and likely to reshape the crucial relationship. Tillerson's speech on Thursday, ahead of a high-profile visit to Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica, came as a revealing indication of what China stands for in the Trump administration's eyes – a ""predatory actor"" ""using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit"". The rhetoric sounds familiar. Indeed, it reminds us of what was the norm during Cold War years. Viewed through the prism of that bygone era, the growing Chinese presence in Latin America is alarming for the US. After all, that part of the Western Hemisphere is what it still regards as its ""backyard"". While the Cold War paradigm no longer applies, there is every sign that the Trump White House believes it does, even though the rest of the world has moved on and is living in 2018. Which is why what appears perfectly normal to China and other countries can look offending, even unacceptable to the US. Despite, as some Western observers have pointed out, Beijing only doing what Washington used to do, pushing free trade, multilateralism, and economic globalization. China is now the largest trading partner with Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. But why is it China? Why is not it the US? What is wrong with it being China? The four countries are in a better position than the US to judge. And, most important of all, what harm has that done to the US, since China insists it has no intention of monopolizing trade ties?         "
Brute force and ignorance define US’ nuclear review,2/4/2018,"                                                 The US flag is hoisted at Camp Hope, a homeless encampment near the Honda Center in Anaheim, California on January 23, 2018. [Photo: VCG]   The intention alone — to enhance the United States’ nuclear deterrence, which is already the most powerful in the world — should be enough to raise the alarm, as it runs counter to the international commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  However, the real danger of its new nuclear policy lies in what it signals the US plans to do to enhance its nuclear capabilities. In its first Nuclear Posture Review in eight years, the Pentagon calls for, among other measures, the development of smaller “low-yield” nuclear weapons that can be used in response to what it calls “extreme circumstances”, including non-nuclear attacks such as cyberattacks.  Whether because of its economic need to feed its military-industrial beast, or its genuine inability to see beyond force as a means of crisis resolution, the US seems intent on securing the bragging rights to not only the biggest, but also the smallest nuclear button, which promises to start a new nuclear arms race.  And despite claims making them smaller does not lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, the US is clearly developing them as weapons to be used, not as a deterrent.  This will only increase the possibility of a nuclear war.  Since the US demonstrated the destructive capabilities of nuclear weapons, with the atomic bombs it dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the close of World War II, no nuclear weapons have been used due to the Cold War equilibrium of mutually assured destruction.  However, the new US policy will nullify this. From its previously revealed National Defense Strategy and the National Security Strategy to Friday’s Nuclear Posture Review, the US government under President Donald Trump has sent an unmistakable message that the US is determined to seek military preeminence. Once again professing to be more sinned against than sinning, the US is seeking to justify the adjustment to its nuclear strategy as countermeasure in response to the threat and competition from countries such as China and Russia.  The review does come at a critical moment for the US, because it does face a “complex and demanding” international security situation, but that is one of its own making as it seems unable to let go of outdated ideological differences.  In the report’s preface, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says: “We should look reality in the eye and see the world as it is, not as we wish it to be”.  The Trump administration seems intent on doing the opposite.         "
Muji's map mistake need not impede thaw in ties,2/1/2018,"                                                 Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with his visiting Japanese counterpart Taro Kono at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse Sunday morning in Beijing. [Zhang Yunbi/For chinadaily.com.cn]   Immediately after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated his eagerness to improve his country's relations with China, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono made a visit to Beijing that was widely interpreted as a sign of a long overdue thaw in ties.  While in Beijing, Kono and his hosts exchanged promises to work together to improve relations as this year is the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China, and Kono conveyed Tokyo’s hope that the leaders of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea could meet.  Yet subsequent developments are a reminder that it is optimistic to think that the relationship will improve if the fundamental situation remains the same.  Not surprisingly, it is the disputed islands in the East China Sea on which the good momentum has run aground.  Commenting on the request by China's surveying and mapping administration for the Japanese lifestyle company Muji to correct a faulty map that mismarks Chinese territories, including the Diaoyu Islands, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the move was ""unacceptable"". Also on Wednesday, Abe warned Beijing to not underestimate his administration's resolve regarding the islands.  Like the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, the Diaoyu Islands are an inflammable issue between Beijing and Tokyo, one that has triggered numerous rounds of tense diplomatic wrangling. However, given both parties' desire for a thaw in ties, it would appear unlikely the Muji incident will be allowed to get in the way.  After all, Muji is only one of many companies that have been admonished for that kind of fault. There is no sign China is trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. It is Tokyo’s response, including lodging an official complaint with Beijing, that has done that.  However, this has been another reminder that the sensitive issues that hold back relations will not go away, and they will continue to be a drag on forging friendly relations until Beijing and Tokyo find a way, as they did in the 1970s and 1980s, to put them on the back burner.  Back then, by agreeing to shelve the disputes that were impossible to resolve at the time, the leaders of the two countries demonstrated outstanding political wisdom and cultivated precious goodwill between the two peoples long estranged by the war.  That is statesmanship that the Japanese leaders today can learn from.         "
HK returning officer upheld election rules,2/1/2018,"                                             About a dozen radical supporters of Hong Kong separatism forced their way into the conference room where the Eastern District Council was to meet on Tuesday afternoon, causing the meeting to be canceled. It seems the mob's real target was Anne Teng Yu-yan, the returning officer who disqualified Agnes Chow as a candidate in the Legislative Council by-election to be held in March, because she rightly deemed her nomination to be invalid as Chow's party advocates ""democratic self-determination with independence as an option"". Details on the eligibility to be nominated as a candidate, disqualification for being nominated as a candidate and from being elected as a Legislative Council member, and the requirements to be complied with by people nominated as candidates are set out in the Legislative Council Ordinance, which stipulates that a person can only be validly nominated as a candidate if they submit a signed declaration stating they will uphold the Basic Law. This in turn stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. Those who advocate ""Hong Kong independence"" in any shape or form are thus ineligible to hold public office, and the returning officer was correctly doing her job and fulfilling her duty by ruling Chow's nomination as a candidate was invalid. The returning officers help ensure that elections in Hong Kong are conducted openly, fairly and honestly. In 2016, six opposition politicians who were elected as members of the Legislative Council were disqualified because they openly violated the Basic Law and other Hong Kong laws when taking their oath. They failed to uphold the commitments of their signed declarations and their acts of moral turpitude shocked all law-abiding Hong Kong residents. Thankfully, despite what these separatists claim, the rule of law remains effective in the special administrative region and those Hong Kong residents who are not seeking their 15 minutes in the media spotlight are not fooled by their words and are dismissive of such childish stunts as the one on Thursday. However, some radical separatists have been sentenced to prison after they resorted to violence in pursuit of their political aims. The moderate members of the opposition camp should dissociate themselves lest they become ensnared in acts whose legal consequences they did not anticipate.         "
Trump's 'clarity' about adversaries shows  US is still stuck in the past,1/31/2018,"                      In what was part elegy of remembrance for days now past and part call for action so they might be relived, US President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. Characterized by his usual chronic ballyhooing, it was notable not because it offered anything new, but because of its affirmation that for his administration everything can be boiled down to the simple binary choice of you are either with us or against us. While patting himself on the back and offering a full helping of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for those his administration considers American, his speech set out a similar proposition to that of one of the previous occupants of the White House, who proclaimed “there can be no divided allegiance here”, and once again laid bare his administration’s reductive and confrontational view of the complexities of international relations. Beating the drum for unity, he called on his fellow citizens to set aside their differences and “seek out common ground”, living the American dream “as one team, one people and one American family”. Yet the nation remains as divided as it was when he first entered office, with no bipartisan compromises likely to be reached on issues ranging from immigration to energy policies. The extent of the fault line was underscored by the mostly silent response from Democratic lawmakers throughout his speech. For although coached in a more somber tone than has been his norm and purporting to be a vision of inclusion and confidence, his speech was once again a hymn to exclusion and a litany of insecurities. Harping on his usual complaint that the United States is somehow hard done by under the deals it has agreed to, he declared “the era of economic surrender is over”, which only served to reinforce the fact that often if you take away the opinions you take away the complaint. Worse, by naming China and Russia as rivals that “challenge our interests, our economy and our values”, he placed them along with rogue regimes and terrorist groups as “horrible dangers” to the US. Yet to conclude from that Sino-US relations are inevitably on a collision course is too pessimistic, especially given the huge interdependence between the world’s largest and second-largest economies and broad common ground that they share. But it does mean ill words should not be doubled by ill deeds if they are to make best use of the bonds that have been forged. Rather than trying to turn back time with his America first strategy, Trump should validate his election as a break with the past by embracing an American moment that is of the times. For experience shows that rather than complacency and concessions, it is when the US tries to take matters into its own hands that it invites its troubles.         "
Reboot for Sino-UK ties in the wake of Brexit,1/30/2018,"                      With the largest-ever trade delegation in her entourage of any overseas trip made by a British prime minister, Theresa May’s three-day visit to China certainly means business. The 50 or so business leaders, who May said represent all parts of the UK economy, are expected to garner a sizable bunch of deals during the visit. Something the embattled UK leader will be glad to return with. But while business deals are essential for enriching and consolidating relations, the more important part of the visit for May will be in what way, and to what extent, the visitor and her hosts can advance the theoretically fine agreement to make the UK China’s closest partner in the West, which was one of the outcomes of President Xi Jinping’s visit to the United Kingdom in 2015. Then, the two governments pledged to build a “global, comprehensive partnership oriented at the 21st century”, in anticipation of which, her predecessor David Cameron predicted a “golden era” for China-UK relations. May’s visit is thus being viewed as an opportunity to reboot that golden era in the wake of the UK’s changed circumstances. Thus May’s first formal visit to China as prime minister carries special significance because as the visit by a British leader since the country voted to leave the European Union, it is being viewed as determining what the “golden era 2.0” the two countries attempt to formulate will be like. The UK is expected to terminate its EU membership on March 29, 2019, and upgrading China-UK relations and securing Chinese investments would effectively help to ease the ensuing withdrawal pains the UK is expected to suffer. As the first major Western power and European country to join the China-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the UK is still regarded in Beijing as a potentially meaningful international partner. And since Downing Street has its eyes on the “huge trade opportunities” in China’s market of more than 1.3 billion consumers for UK businesses, there is no reason for it not to take advantage of China’s pro-globalization efforts, those under the Belt and Road Initiative in particular. UK exports to China have grown over 60 percent since 2010. UK businesses will be rewarded even more handsomely given the worldwide reach of the Belt and Road. Although it remains to be seen how May’s visit plays out, fostering a closer partnership would undoubtedly be rewarding for both parties.         "
DPP's game over holiday flights will fool no one,1/29/2018,"                          Passengers make their way out of the arrival lounge after arriving on Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) plane at Beijing Capital International airport January 29, 2005 in Beijing, China.   The Taiwan aviation authority still refuses to give the green light to the 176 extra flights planned by China Eastern Airlines and Xiamen Air to facilitate travel from the mainland back to the island for Spring Festival.  Safety concerns have been cited as the excuse because both airlines fly the M503 air route. But that route has been proved safe since it was launched on March 29, 2015. It is obvious that the island’s authorities are playing a political game at the cost of convenient cross-Straits travel during the holiday.  With hidden intent, the leaders of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that they would be willing to sit down and talk with the mainland if the latter gives a goodwill gesture.  They well know that the mainland would turn a deaf ear to such an offer, since cajoling the mainland into talks on the issue would end up as a fait accompli that the mainland resumed communication with the island authorities without the latter upholding the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China.  Then the DPP no doubt believes it will be able to shift the blame for the travel inconvenience onto the mainland, saying it shows no concern for compatriots on the island, and is not willing to sit down and talk with the island for measures to facilitate their travel across the Straits for Spring Festival.  What a clever trick it must have seemed to them.  Yet they have failed to conceal this ulterior motive. It is evident what they are trying to engineer with their poor excuse for not approving the extra flights.  It is absurd for the Taiwan authorities to believe that those intending to travel to the island during the trouble, who it seems will now have to make a more convoluted journey via Jinmen Island, will point an accusing finger at the mainland for the inconvenience they have encountered because of the Taiwan authorities’ absurd decision.  By refusing the extra flights, the Taiwan authorities are only shooting themselves in the foot. The trick they are trying to play only reveals their true nature as secessionists pursuing their political goal at the expense of the well-being of the island’s residents.         "
Digital Iron Curtain shows US' Cold War mindset,1/29/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump speaks upon arrival for dinner at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, US, Jan 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   US President Donald Trump will deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday, which according to a media briefing by a senior official will harp on the now familiar refrain of what his administration is doing to build “a safe, strong, and proud America”.  One of the things the Trump administration seems to be considering doing, according to a memo and PowerPoint presentation produced by a senior National Security Council official and obtained by US news website Axios, is taking responsibility for building a super-fast 5G wireless network, to counter what it presupposes is a threat posed by China to US “cyber security and economic security”.  The ideologically charged proposal harks back to the rhetoric — and strategies — of the Cold War. It even contains the suggestion that the work on a secure 5G network could be exported to emerging markets to “protect democratic allies against China” and to “help inoculate developing countries against Chinese neo-colonial behavior”.  But as well as simply exposing the US’ growing apprehension about China’s technological capabilities and the change in strategy being pursued by the Trump administration, which seems to be taking the form of controlled confrontation, its clichés presenting China as a “malicious actor” come across as simply a means to pave the way for more protectionist measures against Chinese technology hoping to gain a foothold in the US market.  5G, the author of the document states, “can position the United States to leap ahead of global competitors” and “promises benefits for American commerce”.  But such claims and the smearing of Chinese companies are a pea-and-shell game intended to fool Americans into believing the US can recreate its glory days of undisputed technological leadership. Previous US probes into Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE on charges they provide a backdoor for espionage and threaten critical US infrastructure have never been backed up with anything to support the claims.  The planned nationalization of this historically private sector would be unprecedented, given that currently it is the wireless carriers in the US that each build their own systems with their equipment. How it might erode an American culture that trumpets free market rules and laissez-faire capitalism as the cornerstone of robust business and commerce activities remains to be seen.  Certainly the claim it will protect Americans from having their conversations overheard seems unlikely, since the American government is the only one known to have a penchant for listening in, usually in a bid to gain economic advantages, rather than out of security concerns.  What the proposal does do is put into stark relief the growing unease the US feels at the competition resulting from China’s technological progress. However, containing its own anxieties rather than seeking to contain China would be of more benefit to itself and the world.         "
Japan must make concrete moves to improve relations,1/28/2018,"                          Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with his visiting Japanese counterpart Taro Kono at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse Sunday morning in Beijing. [Zhang Yunbi/For chinadaily.com.cn]   As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with his Japanese counterpart on Sunday, ties between China and Japan are like a boat trying to make its way against the current, and the two countries need to overcome the turbulence and obstacles that stand in their way if they are to make any progress in improving their relations.Certainly both sides have made a series of goodwill gestures recently indicating they would like to try and ameliorate relations, with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono’s ongoing visit to China the latest of these. And coming so early in the year, his visit has been welcomed by China as a continuation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stated willingness to engage with Beijing and increase communication and mutual trust. Although there has been some resuscitation of engagement, including high-level contact at various international platforms and the resumption of dialogue and consultation in some areas, so far the momentum has not been strong enough to restore the vitality of ties attained before the Japanese government “nationalized” the Diaoyu Islands in 2012, an act that put an abrupt brake on the positive momentum that had been carefully cultivated.Without addressing the major hurdles facing bilateral ties, hopes for advancing ties will be tantamount to wishing a river can flow without a source. Japanese politicians, Abe included, should abandon any illusion they might harbor that the ice between the two countries can be melted by Japan only paying lip service.The crux of the matter is Japan matching its words with deeds.Last week, just a few days after Abe told the Japanese congress that he wants to improve relations with China, the Japanese government opened an exhibition in Tokyo to showcase Japan’s claim to the Diaoyu Islands, a move that only raises suspicions about Abe’s sincerity in improving ties.The status quo in the East China Sea is the fundamental obstacle impeding healthy relations, if Japan wants to translate its positive remarks into improved relations with China it will have to make concrete policies and actions to show it is willing to address this. Obviously, the ball is in Japan’s court, and hopefully Kono’s visit will signal Tokyo’s recognition that the 40th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty should be marked with gestures of sincere amity.            "
Trump offers nothing new in Davos speech,1/28/2018,"                      In an obvious attempt to assuage the concerns of an elite global audience worried about his protectionist, isolationist “America First” strategy, United States President Donald Trump told attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday that “America is open for business”.The US president was the hottest ticket in town and delivered his speech in a packed conference hall because people were curious about what he would say concerning the common challenges facing the international community. Yet rather than sharing with his audience American solutions, he used the podium as an opportunity to promote his achievements at home and sell the US as the best place for foreign investment.Although he availed himself of the Davos podium to argue “America First” does not equal “America alone”, and to “affirm America's friendship and partnership in building a better world”, his sales pitch was simple: “There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States.”His rhetoric, cautiously tailored to tone down his irritating tenet, made him sound quite unlike his usual tweeting self. Yet his argument remained America-centric and had little to do with the core concern of the Davos gathering – “creating a shared future in a fractured world”.Boasting “the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America”, he urged foreign investors to ""bring your money, your jobs, your businesses” to the US.There is no surprise in Trump hawking the benefits of the US as the best place to do business, as he has expressed the sentiment many times before as part of his bid to make America great again.What was perhaps more surprising was Trump deigning to acknowledge the Davos theme and speak of cooperation “toward shared dreams”. Although there was no clue as to what goals and dreams his administration wants others to share, aside from others helping to make the US great again, economic globalization as the rest of the international community sees it, especially free, unimpeded international trade, is obviously not to Trump’s taste.Instead, while stating his allegiance to “fair and reciprocal trade”, Trump’s protectionist tendencies and policies threaten to render the already fractured world even more divided. How these policies are implemented over the coming months will show to what extent the US’ rivalry and competition will damage the global economy.         "
Making bearish bets on China remains a losing proposition,1/25/2018,"                          A CRH train production site of CRRC's Qingdao Sifang Co Ltd in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province. [Photo/Xinhua]   US writer Gordon Chang only made himself a laughing stock with his 2001 book The Coming Collapse of China, but international hedge fund managers who have bet against China’s economy are losing their pants.  In 2017 alone, bearish investors who “shorted” Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or the Chinese mainland suffered losses of more than $35 billion, almost half their total stake, the Financial Times reported earlier this week, citing New York-based data provider S3 Partners. That has led to some of those China bears shutting their funds, many of which were set up following the 2008-09 global financial crisis that exposed the weaknesses in Western economies.  Throughout China’s rise over the past four decades, there has never been a lack of doomsayers uttering dire warnings about the country’s economic and political future. Yet their pessimistic forecasts have never accorded with reality.  China’s economy has increased nearly tenfold since the publication of Chang’s book, contributing to more than 30 percent of the global economic growth annually over the past five years, exceeding the combined total of the United States, Europe and Japan. Its continued growth to supplant the US as the world’s largest economy in the years to come seems to be a question of when, not if.  The FT report attributes the wrong betting by the China bears to their misreading of the country’s economic situation. What it fails to mention is this is borne out of the perennial bias, arrogance and complacency harbored by some in the West toward China.  They are still looking at China through an ideologically tinted lens, even though as writer Martin Jacques remarked, China “has overturned more than 200 years of history” in its process of development.  Their blinkered views mean their expectations for China’s future tend to be based on subjective impressions rather than objective analysis. They tend to focus only on the economic or social woes that China suffers on its development path while turning a blind eye to its resolve and capacity, as well as its systemic advantages, that enable it to overcome these obstacles and press on to its goals. For instance, the “short China” fund managers see the country’s debt mountain, but underestimate the country’s ability to defuse the risks to its financial stability.  On Wednesday, at the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, Liu He, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Chinese delegation, said the country will continue to push ahead with reform and further open its market to the world, echoing what President Xi Jinping emphasized in his speech at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, when he said the country will press ahead with reforms to realize the economic transition from “quantity to quality” despite any headwinds they may encounter.  The future will show that it is those leaders and investors who are bullish on China that will be on the right side history.         "
Building a shared future is right remedy for world’s ills,1/24/2018,"                                             It is no coincidence that both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau devoted their opening speeches at this year’s World Economic Forum to the safeguarding of free trade, and that the theme for the gathering is “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World”. While plenty of common concerns have been brought to the fore at the annual get-together in Davos, from sexual harassment to terrorism to economic inequality, Modi, Trudeau and the Davos organizers revealed the simple truth that much of the rest of the world is keenly feeling the same worries President Xi Jinping expressed at last year’s event when he delivered a resounding pro-globalization speech. “Many societies and countries are becoming more and more focused on themselves,” Modi said on Tuesday. “The negative impact of this kind of mindset and wrong priorities cannot be considered less dangerous than climate change or terrorism.” The alternative — “build a shared future for mankind” as Xi urged in a subsequent speech at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva last year. There are no doubt divergences between Chinese and Indian perspectives and approaches to development and everything else, but on these points Modi and Xi are in agreement. Again, this is in no way coincidental. China and India, with their exemplary rapid growth over the years, have been among the biggest beneficiaries of economic globalization. From their own rags-to-riches experiences in the global market prior to the recent rise of protectionist, isolationist tendencies, they are in the best positions to tell the rest of the world about the advantages of economic globalization and interconnectedness. But they are not the only ones, nor is it just emerging economies, which have benefitted from open trade and globalization. The current United States administration’s signature “America First” slogan worries both its northern neighbor and others, including its allies in Europe and Asia, because they, too, having been beneficiaries, are keenly aware of the hazardous potential of the White House’s anti-globalization backpedaling. The US president is also due to give a speech at Davos, in which he is expected to “tell the world that America is open for business”. Which is not so bad; at least that sounds better than “America only”, which has been what we have heard from his administration so far. But the world expects a lot more from the global leadership the Donald Trump administration aspires to retain. It will be interesting to see how Trump makes his case on Friday, and if he can get his worried audience on his side.         "
Abusing trade remedies part of Trump’s agenda,1/23/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump speaks upon arrival for dinner at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, US, Jan 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The decision by US President Donald Trump on Monday to impose tariffs on imported solar energy components and large washing machines, signals Washington is quickening its pace to embrace anti-trade populism under the pretext of pursuing “fair trade”.  While the tariffs will do little to help US manufacturers or create jobs in these sectors, China as the world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels and washing machines will obviously bear the brunt of the protectionist measures, suggesting they are the latest salvo in the Trump administration’s broader trade strategy against the world’s second-largest economy.  The decision comes hard on the heels of Washington derailing two deals involving Chinese companies — the planned partnership that would have seen AT&T sell Huawei’s smartphones in the US market and the blocking of Alibaba’s proposed acquisition of the money transfer service MoneyGram — both ostensibly on national security concerns.  China’s Ministry of Commerce has responded to the latest move by calling it an abuse of trade remedies, saying that by using a domestic law rather than the World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures, the United States is undermining a cornerstone of the international trade order.  It is not hard to predict that more US manufacturing sectors will be encouraged by the move to seek similar restrictive measures in an effort to win their survival battle, which portends more trade frictions.  However, protectionism will not revive the fortunes of struggling US companies or create jobs. Such corporate welfare merely puts these companies on temporary life support.  That is why the vast majority of the US solar industry opposed the tariffs, saying in effect they are a cheap shot to appease Trump’s populist support that will backfire and harm the broader solar industry in the US.  And while Trump might be dismissive of the effects of a trade war with China, others in the US are less sanguine about the prospect, fearing it will damage its economy and put a brake on the nascent global economic recovery.  Certainly, such protectionist measures are likely to provoke retaliatory measures, while doing nothing to address the economic forces that have battered US manufacturers and impelled manufacturing out of the country.  Trump has promised to make America great again. But he stands a slim chance of achieving the goal if he insists on bucking the trend of globalization and free trade by pursing US interests at the expense of other nations.  The US president is due to speak on the last day of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday, which is likely to highlight just how out of step with other countries the US is, and to what extent it intends to pursue its populist agenda.

US shows it's hell-bent on having its own way,1/22/2018,"                                                 US President Donald Trump, accompanied by US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, left, walks up the steps into the Pentagon after making a statement in Washington, DC on on  Jan 18, 2018. [Photo: VCG]   US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' weeklong trip to Asia has caught global attention as it comes just two days after the Pentagon revealed its national defense strategy on Friday. Not surprisingly, it has been anticipated that his visits to Vietnam and Indonesia will set out new markers for US strategy in the Asia-Pacific.  However, rather than announcing a sharply different approach to that of the previous US administration, the signals given so far suggest the current administration simply intends to ratchet up the strategy pursued by its predecessor.  Although Mattis will likely refrain from referring to it in the same terms, judging by the US' recently released report on the strategic thinking of the Donald Trump administration, which views China and Russia as growing threats to the US, the trip is intended to reinforce the confrontational posture the US and its regional allies adopted toward China under the Barack Obama administration by bringing the two countries onboard its containment strategy.  Maritime cooperation tops Mattis' agenda during his trip, according to media reports, indicating that the Trump administration wants to project US power in the waters and fish for its own interests in the region with the help of others.  Certainly, Wednesday's incident in which the US guided missile destroyer USS Hopper entered the waters around China's Huangyan Island without permission offers further evidence that the US intends to stir up trouble again in the South China Sea.  When the Obama administration switched the US' focus to the Asia-Pacific and usurped the regional maritime disputes in the South China Sea as part of its rebalancing strategy, regional tensions rose to unprecedentedly high levels and cast a shadow over the efforts to enhance the cooperation between China and Southeast Asian countries. This looks to be the US' intention again.  However, as Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu has pointed out, the cooling down of tensions in the region is a positive trend that should be encouraged and China’s demonstration of greater openness and willingness to cooperate for the good of the region should be appreciated.  Certainly, China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have worked extremely hard to ease the tensions and realize their common wish to safeguard peace and stability in the region.  The patriotic chest-thumping embodied in the Trump administration's ""America first"" mantra defines American exceptionalism as it being the winner in a self-created global competition for primacy, which, with regard to its foreign policy, is determined by its relative military prowess and Cold War born alliance system. However, treating China as an adversary will not make the US feel great again, it will only feed the paranoia and insecurity that prevents it from coming to terms with the trends of the times.

Abe must now follow up on his words of friendship,1/22/2018,"                                                 Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, attends a plenary session at the lower house of parliament in Tokyo, Japan, on Jan 22, 2018. [Photo: VCG]   In his policy address on the opening of a new session of parliament on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once again focused on his idée fixe when he spoke of changing the Constitution so as to shape the future of the country.  Abe has long nurtured the ambition of revising the country's Constitution, specifically its key war-renouncing clause that restricts the activities of Japan's Self-Defense Forces.  However, it is a divisive issue in Japan, which is why in his address he raised it under the banner of nationalism - something that has proved effective elsewhere in the world in these uncertain times - saying that by changing the Constitution ""we will be creating our nation"" for the next 50 years or 100 years.  Given that many observers see such a move as being in response to China's rise, which has seen it displace Japan from its postwar leading role in Asia, it was somewhat reassuring that he directly addressed Japan's relations with its neighbor in less antagonist tones than he has been prone to do in the past.  He described Japan and China as being ""inseparable"" and pledged that with this year being the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty, he will seek to realize reciprocal visits by him and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""as soon as possible"".  He also said that Japan will cooperate with China on Asia's growing infrastructure needs.  These remarks echo a series of signals Abe has sent in recent months that he is seeking better ties with China, which have been marred by differences over Japan's wartime history and the two countries’ territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea.  Now Abe should act accordingly to help dispel any doubts about his sincerity, given his continuous push to revise Japan's postwar, pacifist Constitution so that Japan can take part in military conflicts abroad and build an Indo-Pacific security strategy with the United States, India and Australia to compete with and contain China, is at odds with his claim that his administration will seek to meet the expectations of the international community by developing friendly relations with China.  After all, actions speak louder than words.         "
US erring in trying to circumvent trade norms,1/21/2018,"                                             It will have come as no surprise to those keeping a watchful eye on the dynamics in the relations between the world's two largest economies that the current administration is claiming the United States made a mistake when it backed China's membership of the World Trade Organization. In the latest sign of the Trump administration's unwillingness to embrace an open, market-orientated trade regime and instead promote its own frontier justice to protect its competitive advantage, it said in the annual report to Congress on China's compliance with WTO commitments that ""it seems clear that the United States erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO"". By making such as claim, the US is willfully ignoring the fact that in the 16 years since it was admitted as a member, China has revised hundreds of domestic laws and regulations to bring them in line with WTO rules, reduced its tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, and adjusted its trade-related regulatory policies. The substantial moves it promised and has taken to open up its market have greatly benefited the US — from its leading companies to individual farmers and consumers. However, under the WTO framework for settling trade disputes, the US cannot act high-handedly when it comes to trade disputes with China. As a result, it has many times hinted it will quit the WTO so it can use its own trade measures against China and other trade partners. Such an imperious way of dealing with its trade competitors would not only be dangerous for the normal workings of global trade, it would also fail to address the shortcomings that are the root of the US' unease about its ability to see off the competition that has emerged in the last decade. Trump has said he hopes there will not be a trade war with China, ""but if there is, there is."" If there is, he will not be able to so easily dismiss the consequences of what is not such a foregone conclusion. President Xi Jinping urged Trump to come to the table on economic issues when he spoke to him by phone last week. ""The two countries should adopt constructive means to properly settle economic and trade issue of mutual concern through opening up markets to each other and making the cake of cooperation bigger,"" Xinhua News Agency quoted Xi as saying. Cooperation rather than confrontation would certainly benefit the US more.         "
Pentagon's strategy is not a good fit for the times,1/21/2018,"                                             A US guided missile destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of China's Huangyan Island on Wednesday evening without Beijing's permission. On Friday, the US Department of Defense published its first new National Defense Strategy in a decade, in which China and Russia replace terrorism as the country's foremost adversaries. On the surface, there is no surprise in either case. The Wednesday trespass was a replay of what has already happened multiple times. The new defense strategy builds on the National Security Strategy announced on December 18 and is a logical extension of it. But the US' latest defense strategy merits serious attention as it marks a substantive turn in US strategic thinking, which may lead to essential changes in bilateral interaction. China-US relations have weathered various forms and degrees of suspicion and frictions thanks to their commitment to mutual goodwill. Despite all their differences and the competitive nature of their relationship, neither has openly called the other an adversary. The Trump Administration had previously pledged to develop bilateral ties in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. It has more recently backpedalled and committed to a ""constructive, results-oriented"" relationship, yet despite such verbal gymnastics there was the general feeling that it was willing and seeking to get along with Beijing. However, as US Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Friday when he released the Pentagon's new strategy, ""great power competition"" is now the ""primary focus"" of US national security. This reflects a Cold War mindset that has the potential to not only fundamentally redefine the China-US relationship, but one that threatens to put the two militaries on a collision course. Indulging in the imaginary return of great power rivalry, his department risks severely undercutting the corresponding endeavors both countries have made over the years to avoid that worst-case scenario and avoid the major-power confrontation the strategy envisages. Mattis was dangerously wrong in praising it as a ""good fit for the times"". For although the strategy is aimed at reaffirming the US' hegemony, through its alliance and partnership structure and building up its military advantage, it is trying to maintain a status quo that no longer exists. The world is changing, and the US should be looking toward the future rather than looking back to an imagined golden age.         "
Trump should not be blasé about possibility of trade war,1/18/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump speaks upon arrival for dinner at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, US, Jan 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The Chinese and United States economies have become so closely interwoven through trade in the past decades that a trade war would be costly, potentially debilitating, for both countries, with neither emerging a winner.  Based on their common awareness of this, both Beijing and Washington have treaded prudently on trade issues, despite their quarrels. Since neither can afford to cut trade ties, they have to find a way to get along anyway. And nothing works better than constructive engagement in resolving trade disputes.  A businessman himself, Donald Trump knows the importance of mutual goodwill when it comes to trade, and the harmful potentials of its absence. So even as he threatened Beijing with a very big fine for alleged theft of intellectual property on Wednesday, the US president stated he doesn't want a trade war.  We may have to wait until after his State of the Union address on Jan 30 to find out how far beyond our imagination that fine will be. But judging from Beijing's pledge to take ""all necessary measures"" and ""resolutely safeguard"" China's legitimate rights and interests, reciprocal actions will be inevitable if Washington does impose penalties under the rarely used Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974.  Although neither party is in favor of a full-blown trade war, the US is promoting trade protectionism and blocking Chinese investment under the guise of national security as part of Trump's bid to ""make America great again"". The political climate is already less than friendly, if not yet hostile, to the Chinese presence in the US.  The US House of Representatives introduced a bill on Jan 9 that would prohibit government purchases of telecoms equipment from Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE Corporation. US lawmakers are urging wireless carrier AT&T to cut all commercial ties with Huawei and deny China Mobile access to the US market on so-called national security concerns. The US government has blocked a string of Chinese acquisitions on similar grounds, including Ant Financial's proposed purchase of money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc.  Whether the apparently imminent wrangling will be in the form of tit-for-tat tariffs, or access denial for each other's companies, consumers, companies and the economies of both countries will be the ultimate victims in such a hazardous game.  Not much time is left for the White House to wise up and avoid that lose-lose scenario.         "
HK separatists stoop to threats and blackmail,1/18/2018,"                      Four years ago when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was preparing for an electoral reform package with the aim of implementing universal suffrage for the chief executive election in 2017, there were threats of political consequences from those seeking a new electoral system.  So when fresh warnings about political consequences were issued should a couple of their favored candidates fail the eligibility test for the March 11 Legislative Council by-election, it triggered a strong sense of déjà vu.  It seems that they have yet to learn a lesson from their miscalculations in the past.  The 79-day illegal “Occupy Central” campaign launched in fall of 2014 — the political consequences they threatened — failed to help them achieve their goals. Rather, it caused havoc in the region in terms of economic losses, and dealt a damaging blow to their image. The subsequent court cases have seen several leaders and participants jailed for various unlawful behaviors during the campaign.  The key lesson to learn from the “Occupy Central” fiasco is that trying to blackmail the government into doing something will not pay off in the SAR, where rule of law is cherished as one of its core values.  Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has rightly rejected the demand that she promise that certain candidates will not be disqualified from the March 11 by-election of Hong Kong’s local legislature. She would have violated the law were she to make such a promise.  As she said on Tuesday, all elections in Hong Kong are fair, open and conducted according to the law with the eligibility of candidates decided by the requirements set out by the Electoral Affairs Commission, one of which is the pledge to uphold HK’s Basic Law.  Several candidates who had championed separatism in Hong Kong, which is against the Basic Law, were barred from running by election officers in the 2016 Legislative Council election. Candidates who plan to run in the upcoming by-election have no reasons to worry about their eligibility if they have not advocated separatism.  The Legislative Council is a key part of the political establishment of the SAR, which is an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, and anyone who does not sincerely embrace SAR’s political setup shall never be admitted into the legislative chamber.

Vancouver talks have only fueled peninsula tensions,1/17/2018,"                          US Vice President Mike Pence looks toward the north from an observation post inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, Republic of Korea, April 17, 2017. [Photo: VCG]   Co-hosted by the United States and Canada, the gathering of the foreign ministers of the allies that fought on the side of the United States in the Korean War has further complicated what was already a grave crisis.  The participants claimed the meeting, which concluded on Tuesday, was held because it was their firm and shared desire to avoid a devastating conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Yet the signal it has sent has been exactly the opposite.  Held at a time when the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have been in direct communication for the first time in two years, the meeting invoked the battle lines of the past conflict, with China and Russia not invited to have a say in the proceedings.  Rather than nurturing the positive changes and working with all parties to jointly maintain the hard-won momentum for the resumption of talks, as President Xi Jinping has urged, the meeting once again reinforced the impression that the US is not interested in a solution that is in the interests of all, but rather in determining an end-state to the crisis that is of its choosing.  The talk in Vancouver was all about tougher sanctions and greater pressure on Pyongyang, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson once again warning the DPRK could trigger “a military response” if it did not mend its ways, and verifiably and irreversibly abandon all of its weapons of mass destruction.  It seems that trouble like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For although the talks between Pyongyang and Seoul have not been directly engineered by the US and will not disarm the DPRK’s nuclear arsenal, and they may indeed be simply a ploy by Pyongyang to stall for time, they have at least helped ease what were becoming extremely acute and volatile tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  Instead of being greeted with a stick, the engagement between Pyongyang and Seoul should have been encouraged with the offering of a carrot.  Many times Washington has expressed the possibility of direct talks with Pyongyang, although on terms it defines.  For those terms to be met, it has to play its part by choosing the path of engagement and negotiation, instead of obstinately pursuing its own course that makes the prospects of finding a solution ever more remote each time an opportunity emerges.

New era has firm foundation for quality-driven progress,1/17/2018,"                          A worker checks the quality of wind turbine fans in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province.[Photo by Geng Yuhe/for China Daily]   It is anticipated China will announce higher-than-expected GDP growth for 2017 on Thursday, but its strong economic performance, marked by its first growth acceleration in seven years, has been tainted by the recent admission by some local governments they have been doctoring their economic data.  Economic development has been an important criterion for evaluations of local officials and some of them in places such as the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Tianjin municipality have resorted to falsifying the figures so they reflect better on their performance. Against that backdrop, it is understandable that doubts have been cast on the quality and accuracy of the world’s second-largest economy’s overall growth data.  However, given the improvement in China’s national statistical regime in recent years, the fabrication of some local data does not impair the accuracy of the national economic data.  China’s national statistics bureau does not rely solely on reports of provincial governments to compile its data for the whole economy. Rather, the bureau has put a direct-reporting system in place, through which the original data of local enterprises are reported, so that it can use the corporate data, together with other local indicators, such as power generation, railway freight and taxes, to crosscheck the accuracy of data provided by the provincial governments.  Such a methodology ensures the credibility of the national data. Those questioning it would do better to shift their focus to what it indicates: the faster rate of growth of the world’s second-largest economy and its improved quality of growth.  Premier Li Keqiang hinted last week that the country’s GDP growth for 2017 would be “around 6.9 percent”, marking the first acceleration in growth in seven years from a 26-year low of 6.7 percent in 2016. To put this in perspective, China’s growth in 2017 was roughly equal to the economic scale of Australia in terms of quantity.  More significantly, there have been signs of further improvement in the country’s economic structure, such as the growing contribution of consumption, the emerging influence of high-tech sectors, the narrowing gap between rural and urban areas, and the successful reduction of excessive production capacities, all of which point to solid progress in pursuing high-quality development.  President Xi Jinping said at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October that China will seek quality-driven development in the new era. The country’s sound economic growth in 2017 has laid the groundwork for achieving that goal in 2018 and the years ahead.         "
Indian officer's remarks at odds with consensus,1/16/2018,"                          Army chief General Bipin Rawat during the Army Day Parade 2018 at Delhi cant, on January 15, 2018 in New Delhi, India. [Photo: VCG]   The mistrust and misgivings harbored by high-ranking Indian officials toward China have more often than not only helped to fan an aggressive patriotism in India, which has done a disservice to the efforts of the two countries to build trust and establish rapport.  This was evident once again on Friday, following the remarks made by India's Army Chief of Staff General Bipin Rawat, who, in an apparent move to beef up the Indian army's morale before India's Army Day on Monday, vowed to handle China's ""assertiveness"", saying China may be powerful, but India is not a weak nation.  Coming so soon after the tense more than two-month standoff that resulted after Indian troops crossed the border into Donglang in June, these remarks — and his call for India's infrastructure development on the northern border ""to be speeded up"" — are ill-judged by any standard, and serve only to push the sensitive border issue between the two neighbors to the fore again.  Although the two sides have exercised restraint and expressed their willingness to mend their fences since the Donglang standoff, that cannot disguise the fact that the sensitivity and complexity of the border issue still exist and how to prevent a strategic misjudgment is a pressing challenge for both sides. Against such a backdrop, the remarks by the chief of the Indian Army do not conform to the consensus reached by the leaders of the two neighbors, nor to the general trend of improving bilateral relations, as China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday.  Admittedly, misperception and narrow-mindedness have prompted some in India to perceive the two neighbors as strategic rivals, something that the United States is hoping to make use of in its geopolitical maneuverings — Rawat's talk of ""China's assertiveness"" echoes the term the US likes to use to portray Beijing as a bully and so cast its actions in a bad light.  However, a head-on clash on the border, even on a limited scale, would squander the consensus achieved by the two sides and shatter the delicate trust that needs to be nurtured.  Although any progress that has been made so far may be imperceptible, both sides say they remain committed to solving the border disagreements through dialogue. And certainly by averting a full-blown military confrontation in August and taking steps to talk and resolve the crisis, both countries demonstrated they do not want to come to blows.  After all, China and India, if they bear in mind that their common interests far outweigh their differences, are bound to discover they can coexist and prosper peacefully together.         "
Biased scrutiny of China’s engagement with Africa,1/15/2018,"                      No matter how many roads, schools and hospitals it has built on the continent, and how much it has contributed to African economies, in the eyes of some people in the West, China can never do anything right in Africa.  These people spread the fallacy that China is simply a neocolonialist country plundering Africa's resources. They claim the money that China pumps into Africa, with no political strings attached, enriches only a few corrupt officials. Now they are again pointing an accusing finger at China, saying its financing has only added to the heavy debt burden of African countries.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was right to refute this as a ""false claim"" during his visit to Angola on Sunday.  The claim is also vicious, as it aims to alienate African countries from China and denigrate the country's international reputation.  China is now Africa's largest trading partner, with two-way trade expanding 22 times, and nonfinancial investment rising sixtyfold between 2000 and 2014. The debt problems that some African countries are facing have been a cumulative result of complex factors, both internal and external, such as failed government policies and changing world export markets, spanning decades. Actually such ills can be fixed only through sustainable economic and social development, which is what China's massive projects aim to achieve.  Unlike the United States, whose condescending approach to Africa was summed up by President Donald Trump in September, when, addressing African leaders at a UN luncheon to discuss the ""tremendous potential"" of Africa, he said: ""I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you.""  While the relationship between China and Africa in the recent past was stereotypically boiled down to the fundamental of infrastructure and development in exchange for natural resources by those seeking to denigrate China, that can no longer be done.  Chinese capital has steadily diversified and is increasingly promoting added-value goods and services in Africa, while African investments in China are on the rise.  It is Africans themselves who are the best qualified to speak about Sino-African cooperation and its benefits. According to a 2016 poll conducted in 36 African countries by a Pan-African research network, almost two-thirds of Africans surveyed had a ""generally favorable"" view of China's role in Africa.That is because the longstanding close relationship between China and Africa has been built on political equality and mutual trust, and led to results that have benefited both sides.

Vancouver Group sows discord with its strong-arm approach,1/15/2018,"                          US Vice President Mike Pence looks toward the north from an observation post inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, Republic of Korea, April 17, 2017. [Photo: VCG]   The so-called Vancouver Group, formed by more than a dozen countries that fought in the Korean War, claims the lofty goal of ""strengthening diplomatic efforts toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula"". But the foreign ministers meeting Canada and the United States are co-hosting is anything but conducive to advancing that claimed goal.  A diplomatic solution to the nuclear/missile crisis and ultimate denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is best for all. And Beijing, for one, has been a steadfast advocate of diplomacy, and welcomes all endeavors oriented at a peaceful resolution.  The Vancouver event, however, is a poorly conceived gathering that will prove counter-productive to that end.  Judging from what has been said and heard, an important, if not central, topic is to be mounting additional pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea via further international sanctions. This is based on the assumption that the United Nations-imposed sanctions have worked and pressed DPRK leader Kim Jong-un to seek a thaw in inter-Korean ties.  Yet at a moment when Pyongyang and Seoul are just beginning a rare detente and talking about further extending mutual goodwill, what good will rhetoric about further sanctions do? What message do they want to send? Can't talk about additional sanctions wait until Pyongyang makes another provocation? Its timing alone appears illogically inopportune.  Not to mention that both concerned insiders and outsiders have pointed out the limitations of the meeting because of the exclusion of China and Russia. Rather than their absence, the Vancouver gathering is more about who is present — the countries represented are primarily those that sent troops to the Korean War as part of the ""allied forces"". Again, what is the message here?  It may be possible for a peaceful solution to be found without engaging Beijing or Moscow. Really, with Seoul and Pyongyang paving the way, who can exclude the likelihood of the US president talking with Kim?  But that remains a low probability. So what good does the gathering do since it merely polarizes stances?  While many suspect Kim is seeking to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington with his olive branch to the former, Ottawa and Washington have taken a move of similarly divisive potential.  Instead of nipping in the bud the dialogue that needs carefully nurturing, the members of the Vancouver Group should be seeking diplomatic ways to help it flourish.         "
No flouting of China's core interests will be tolerated,1/15/2018,"                          JW Marriott hotel is seen in Los Angeles, California, US, Nov 7, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   What if a Chinese enterprise listed Alaska or Hawaii as an independent country rather than a state of the United States? It would definitely be considered as having infringed on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the United States. Of course, none of them would be stupid enough to make such a mistake as they well know that they should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country when doing business there.  However, Marriott International did that by listing China's Tibet autonomous region, the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan as independent countries in a questionnaire to members of its loyalty program. Some staff members of Marriott even gave thumbs up for ""Tibet independence"". Other foreign companies, such as Delta Airlines and other carriers have done the same thing on their official websites.  These foreign companies should be aware that Chinese people are particularly sensitive to the status of Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, which are all parts of China. There is not the least reason for Marriott and the other foreign companies to list these regions as independent countries on any occasion. They should have known that they would provoke a strong reaction from Chinese people.  They should also be aware that they have flouted China's laws, as both the country's Cyber Security Law and the Advertising Law prohibit any individual or company from doing anything that undermines the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  It goes without saying that any foreign company that makes the mistake of doing so owe Chinese people a sincere apology, which Marriott and Delta Airlines have both issued. But apart from that, they need to investigate how such a terrible mistake could have been made given the fact they have already been doing business in China for many years and should have known that such actions constitute a violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also need to adopt necessary measures to prevent such mistakes from being made again.  China welcomes all foreign companies to do business in China, and Chinese authorities have reiterated on many occasions China's opening-up policy. But that does not mean foreign enterprises are immune to the consequences of defying China's laws and can flout the core interests of the country.         "
A Trump's ultimatum on Iran deal out of touch with reality,1/15/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump delivers remarks regarding the Administration's National Security Strategy at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington DC, US, Dec 18, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Though Donald Trump did heed appeals from advisers and allies and waive sanctions against Iran, he simultaneously planted a time bomb for the Iran nuclear deal, the United States' relations with its allies, as well as peace and stability in the Middle East.  Warning that the waiver was ""the last chance"" to ""fix the terrible flaws"" in the agreement, he threatened to withdraw the US ""immediately"" otherwise.  Such a blunt ultimatum, as has been typical of his unilateralist approach to significant international affairs, is both irresponsible and potentially dangerous.  As is obvious in its name-Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action-the Iran nuclear agreement was in the first place a multilateral arrangement. The nature of such an international accord calls for a consensus among all stakeholders for any changes to be made. Not only are all the other parties to the deal content with it, the rest of the international community thinks highly of it too.  And despite Trump's allegation of ""multiple violations"", the International Atomic Energy Agency, the US' European allies, even his own government find Teheran is generally complying with the deal. Beijing cherishes the agreement as a ""paragon"" for resolving international hot-spot issues through diplomacy. So do the US' European allies.  President Trump's request for a side accord, to make the current constraints on Iran's nuclear pursuit permanent, add ""triggers"" for re-imposing sanctions, or to tie sanctions to other concerns, is anything but constructive since Iran would not participate in the process. Teheran has explicitly refused any such attempt.  Trump's ""holistic"" approach is unrealistic, because it aspires for too much in a single deal that was meant specifically to address nuclear concerns.  The Trump White House has been vocal about various other topics regarding Iran, from alleged threats from its long-range missile programs to Hezbollah. More recently, they have berated Teheran for human rights violations amid the latest protests in Iran. But tying those to the nuclear deal will go nowhere in the real world and only destroy what has already been attained.  The existing agreement would not have been possible had the Obama administration not been pragmatic enough to focus on the nuclear issue.  What the Trump administration lacks is precisely the diplomatic realism his immediate predecessor demonstrated in cutting the deal.         "
Australia once again displays misplaced pride and prejudice,1/11/2018,"                      Criticism of China's Belt and Road projects in Pacific island countries by a high-ranking Australian official once again lays bare the deep running bias against China harbored by some politicians in Australia.  In an interview with The Australian newspaper published on Wednesday, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia's minister for international development and the Pacific, accused China of providing loans to Pacific nations on unfavorable terms and constructing ""useless buildings"" and ""roads to nowhere"" in the region.  Her irresponsible comments were, as China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, ""full of ignorance and prejudice"".  Contrary to her claims, China has provided large amounts of foreign assistance to Pacific island countries on the basis of showing respect to the will of their local governments and catering to the development needs of these countries. China’s assistance has been welcomed by these small developing nations as it has greatly helped promote their economic and social development.  Instead of pointing an accusing finger at China, Australia should come up with constructive ideas, if not funds, to address the real concerns of its smaller neighbors.  Australia recorded the biggest decline in aid for the world's poorest people in the OECD's latest rankings, which has affected a wide range of the country's aid programs, including those to its neighbors.  And many Pacific island countries, in recent years, have complained of the bullying of their ""bigger brother"" as it attempts to dominate the regional agenda.  With scant regard for the truth, Fierravanti-Wells has perpetuated the ill trend of Australian politicians and media trying to smear China's image and manipulate the Cold War-style paranoia still harbored by some Australians toward China.  Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was quick to jump on Fierravanti-Wells' bandwagon, claiming China's loans ""impose onerous debt burdens on regional governments"", according to a Sydney Morning Herald report on Thursday.  In doing this, Canberra is once again seeking to stake its claim to be the voice of the Pacific island countries and also demonstrate it’s a reliable ally of the United States.  Yet as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has previously said, the complex regional situation demands ""more integrated policy and fresh ideas"".That as Fierravanti-Wells acknowledged should mean working cooperatively with China.  Instead, Canberra seems intent on doing the opposite.         "
Improved Party ecosystem strengthens cage for power,1/11/2018,"                          Photo: VCG   The world may be full of uncertainties, but there is one thing of which we can be certain: There will be no letup on the central leadership's resolve to ensure no place is out of bounds, no ground left unturned, and no tolerance shown in the fight against corruption.  That five ministerial-level officials have been placed under investigation for abuse of power in the two months since the conclusion of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on Oct 24, 2017, underlies the importance the top leadership attaches to this fight.  And in his speech at the opening of the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on Thursday, General Secretary Xi Jinping made clear the anti-graft campaign will further intensify to consolidate the ruling Party and its governing capability.  Calling for greater efforts to ""fundamentally improve the political ecosystem of the Party"", Xi again stressed that as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the Party must establish a new look and make new accomplishments if it is to strengthen the public’s trust in its governance capabilities.  If corruption persists, it will sap the Party’s vitality and undermine its bond with the people.  Thus, the Party will continue to tighten its discipline and rules to ensure that political responsibility for governance over its members is fulfilled at each level of the Party organization, not just over the majority but also the key minority, with accountability commensurate with responsibilities.  And since the question of who inspects the discipline inspectors has become prominent as the anti-graft campaign has been enforced, the supervision committees that were established on a trial basis in some provinces in late 2016, are due to be set up in more localities, so as to strengthen the supervision over the supervision mechanism.  With the experience the CCDI has accumulated in its work, along with the Party leadership’s resolve to improve its ecostystem, we have enough reason to believe that it will be able to rid itself of the virus of corruption that has been threatening its health.

Fledgling mechanism already shows its worth,1/10/2018,"                      The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism, which was officially inaugurated in 2016, seeks to harness the shared political will for deeper cooperation among the countries through which the world’s 12th-longest river flows, to inject vitality into the development of this populous sub-region, which, for historical reasons, remains comparatively less developed. The seed for this cooperation was planted in November 2014, when Premier Li Keqiang proposed that China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, establish a mechanism to leverage their geographic proximity, traditional friendship and complementary economies for shared development.This seed has taken root and the second Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leaders’ Meeting, which was held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Wednesday, reviewed the many achievements that have already been made in the first two years of this fledgling sub-regional cooperation mechanism and looked ahead to the future.The cooperation mechanism has already realized 45 early harvest projects and six joint working groups in the key priority areas of connectivity, production capacity, cross-border economic cooperation, water resources, agriculture and poverty reduction have been established.China has shown its commitment through practical cooperation that saw its investment in the five other countries reach $2.68 billion in the first 10 months of last year, up 22.3 percent from the same period the previous year.And on Wednesday, Li announced a series of initiatives for water resources, production capacity, agriculture, education and health, which underpin China’s contribution to cooperation and common development.However, hydroelectric projects and dredging, which are altering the flow of the river and raising concerns of ecological damage, are causing frictions that need to be addressed. It is to be hoped that the open discussions about the problems can foster an effective collaborative approach to the river’s management, and the bodies that have been set up to protect the water resources and the river’s ecology can fulfill their roles.Certainly, the outcomes of Wednesday’s meeting — deeper political trust, expanded practical cooperation, and the promoting of comprehensive regional connectivity — indicate that the six countries are willing and able to work together.           "
Political pressure in US scuppers win-win deal,1/10/2018,"                                             The “last minute” decision by US telecoms carrier AT&T to drop a partnership deal with Huawei Technologies to sell the Chinese brand’s smartphones in the United States, as reported on Wednesday, is the result of political pressure rather than business considerations. One month before the deal was to be unveiled this week, US lawmakers sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission asking it to review Huawei’s smartphone business, claiming Huawei, which also makes network equipment, “poses a security threat to the United States and to our systems”. It is ridiculous that such a mindset reminiscent of “reds under the bed” McCarthyism still holds sway in the US in this era of globalization, when no product can be manufactured without global supply chains. In fact, as an industry leader, Huawei has won trust in 170 markets based on integrity of its products. And the deal, if it had gone ahead, would have been win-win. It would not only have given Huawei a foothold in the US market, where more than 90 percent of phones are sold through carriers, but also been a new source of revenue for AT&T and offered another option, besides Apple and Samsung, for US consumers.This is not the first time US politicians have stooped to mudslinging to prevent the entry of Chinese high-tech companies into the US market on the pretext they pose national security threats. As early as in 2012, the US government conducted a probe into Huawei and another Chinese telecom company ZTE, on the grounds they represented security threats, but it never provided substantial proof to support its allegations. Despite that, the probe led to a de facto ban on Huawei participating in any telecom projects in the US. How would the US have reacted if the Chinese government had blocked an Apple deal with a Chinese company? There is little question that Chinese deals often attract especially close scrutiny in the US. This reflects not only the dynamism of Chinese companies and their growing strength as they have moved up the value chain, but also the increasingly prominent economic competition between the two countries.The US continually criticizes China for not opening its market wider and not providing a level playing field for foreign companies. Yet its blocking of deals involving Chinese companies in sectors where it has traditionally had an advantage shows its criticisms have more validity if directed at the US market.           "
Thaw of border talks offers glimmer of hope,1/9/2018,"                            Ri Son-gwon (right), chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, shakes hands with Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon of the Republic of Korea in the truce village of Panmunjom on Tuesday. XINHUA     It is good that the talks between the two Koreas on Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom appeared amicable and constructive, with both delegations seemingly intent on making the meeting a success, even making quips about the winter weather and their frosty relations.  And the unusual, if not unprecedented, suggestion by Ri Son-gwon, the chief delegate of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, that the talks be “open and transparent” and their content be made public “in light of the great expectations and huge interest both here and abroad” and to demonstrate its “sincerity and endeavors” was itself something of a break with the past.  It is now almost certain that we will see athletes of the DPRK competing in the Winter Olympics being held in the Republic of Korea next month, and we may witness something similar to the scenes at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, when athletes from both sides of the 38th Parallel marched under one “Korean Peninsula” banner in identical uniforms at the opening ceremony.  It is also likely that families divided by the Korean War may get another precious opportunity to meet their loved ones amid this sudden exchange of goodwill.  Then, if things go well, looking forward at the best-case scenario, the latest rapport might extend further, toward a longer-lasting thaw in inter-Korea relations.  However, as history has repeatedly proved, inter-Korea ties are too fickle to support unbounded optimism. It is very hard to tell whether the current rapprochement will outlast the upcoming Winter Games, and if so for how long.  And the upbeat assumption of the ROK’s chief delegate Cho Myoung-gyon that “well-begun is half done”, may be more applicable to inter-Korea ties than the broader peninsula issues.  While tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang may be assuaged, at least for the time being, the dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula has not suddenly dissipated. Not only because there are other stakeholders, but also because Pyongyang still resists relinquishing its pursuit of nuclear weapons, grounds for war according to the United States, which has been placed in the firing line.  Although US President Donald Trump again indicated willingness to personally talk with Kim Jong-un on Saturday, his US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley immediately stated the precondition was Kim stop weapons testing for a “significant amount of time”.  However, that does not slam the door shut, as Kim can easily satisfy that request. And after their useless trading of insults, both Trump and Kim may want to try something different.  In that case, the meeting in Panmunjom may well prove to be a welcome New Year’s gift.         "
"China, France to jointly boost multilateralism",1/8/2018,"                      The many ""firsts"" of French President Emmanuel Macron's three-day state visit to China, which began on Monday, already speak of the importance that both countries attach to bilateral relations. It is Macron's first state visit to China, and also his first trip to Asia since his presidential election win last May. It is also the first visit by a foreign leader to China this year. The visit is also the first by a European leader to China since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October. The world's second- and fifth-largest economies have already built robust commercial ties featuring reciprocal benefits in such sectors as aviation, nuclear and high-speed rail technology. There is, however, great potential yet to be tapped. A surplus of 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in China's favor remains an irritant in building a healthy and sustainable trade relationship. But that does not define bilateral relations in general. And with a delegation of business executives from such giants as Airbus and BNP Paribas joining Macron's trip, ""an exceptional number"" of business deals worth billions of dollars are expected to be signed. This will help ease trade frictions and open new horizons for Sino-French trade. As will the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative that aims to connect Asia and Europe by road, rail and sea, which also provides great opportunities for French businesses. China and France can also build a partnership that transcends their bilateral agenda. The common ground that they share in anti-trade protectionism and the fight against climate change, among other things, can enable the two countries to join hands on such issues, where leadership is urgently needed now that US President Donald Trump is pursuing an anti-trade and anti-globalization position with his ""America First"" strategy, and has withdrawn from the Paris climate change agreement. China is committed to the Paris climate deal, seeing it as pivotal for building a community of shared future for all mankind, and to holding high the banner of globalization, which President Xi Jinping said is a tide that is ""irreversible"". Macron, on his part, has promised to promote international cooperation in climate change, and presented himself as a champion of globalization and multilateralism, as evidenced by his support for the European integration project. All this makes Macron a welcome guest in China, as he and Chinese leaders work together to open a new chapter in Sino-French relations that can benefit not only the two countries, but also the rest of the world as well.

Important for local govts to stop cooking the books,1/8/2018,"                          A woker at a steel mill in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province on Oct 27, 2015. [Photo/IC]   To better coordinate government policies and predict and prevent risks, accurate information is indispensible. President Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions that accurate statistics are the lifeline for the government's work and the truthfulness of data must be guaranteed.  That some of the lower-level governments in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region have cooked the books when reporting their budgetary incomes and industrial output, inflating the autonomous region's budgetary incomes by 53 billion yuan ($8.17 billion) and industrial output by 290 billion yuan, has led to the statistics department of the autonomous region trimming the region's GDP for 2016, according to a report by Xinhua News Agency.  It has also led to the region calling a halt to the building of some railway projects and other government-subsidized programs.  And this is not the first such case of local governments massaging statistics. Jilin province was discovered to be falsifying its statistics during an inspection early last year.  Not only does such falsifying of growth-related statistics by local authorities mislead regional and central governments' decision-making, the exposing of padded data also dents investors' confidence since it casts a shadow on the overall integrity of the local governments concerned.  As the world's second-largest economy, China must continue to make efforts to improve the authority of its statistics to assure global investors that it is capable of providing a clean and reliable environment for their investments.Given the seriousness of the problem, therefore, those responsible for fabricating data must be punished in accordance with law and regulations.  However, on the up side, the candidness of the Inner Mongolia authorities in revealing the reporting problems points to the improved working attitude of provincial-level governments, since the nation has strengthened the disciplinary and legal punishments for corrupt officials and those who have proved to be incompetent.  A number of senior officials have been netted in the country's anti-corruption campaigns in recent years and more lower-level officials and public servants have been punished for their failure to properly carry out their duties, moves that have greatly improved the work of governments at all levels and made them more willing to squarely face the problems that exist rather than trying to sweep them under the rug.  And since the problem of local government debt has become a major challenge to the country's financial stability, the decision of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region to stop some construction projects and lower government debt levels sends a positive message that local governments are more aware of the debt problem and willing to act in accordance with the central government's priority of preventing financial risks.

UK's focus ought to be EU,1/5/2018,"                          Union Flags and European Union flags fly near the Elizabeth Tower, housing the Big Ben bell, in Parliament Square in central London, Britain September 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   According to British media reports, the United Kingdom has held informal discussions with some of the members of the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership to explore the possibility of joining the group to boost its exports after it leaves the European Union.  Since it was initiated by New Zealand, Singapore, Chile and Brunei in 2002 with the aim of promoting trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region, talks on the TPP made tangible headway, especially after the United States and 11 other countries signed the TPP agreement in February 2016. However, US President Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing the US from the deal after assuming the presidency, which resulted in a hiatus to the TPP's advancement, prompting the other 11 members to agree on a Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Considering its much weaker presence and influence without the US, the CPTPP will unlikely reject the UK's membership request. However, the UK should know that EU laws still apply to its external economic affairs during the transition period until March 29, 2019. After that date it is likely it will be too exhausted by the Brexit talks to become engrossed in talks on another time-consuming trade agreement.  By attempting to join the TPP, the UK is seeking a way of extricating itself from the dilemma induced by Brexit, but it would do better to focus on the things at hand, such as the second stage of Brexit talks, which are expected to be much more difficult than the first-stage talks, rather than set a new goal that is out of reach for the time being.  Considering its ties with the EU will deteriorate after it leaves the bloc, it may add another choice to the table for Britain to free itself from post-Brexit hardships, but any move to advance TPP membership at present is like a drowning man clutching at a straw.

Modi should not create another setback for ties,1/4/2018,"                          India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks to the media inside the parliament house premises on the first day of the winter session in New Delhi, India December 15 , 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   After China and India defused the two-month long border standoff between their troops last year, both Beijing and New Delhi expressed their aspirations for smoother and more stable ties.  Thus an Indian media report that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning to visit the disputed area it controls and claims as ""Arunachal Pradesh"" in the early part of this year has naturally raised a lot of eyebrows in China.  India's claim to China's South Tibet is an extremely sensitive issue between the two sides and one that New Delhi knows should be handled with care.Obviously, if Modi does stake India’s claim to the disputed area in this way it will antagonize China and cast another shadow over bilateral ties, which were thought to be on the mend after the Donglang standoff was peacefully resolved last year.  On Dec 11, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended a trilateral foreign ministers' meeting with his counterparts from Russia and India in New Delhi. And later that month, on Dec 22, Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi attended the 20th round of talks between Chinese and Indian special representatives on boundary issues in New Delhi.  Both events were seen as signs of improvement in China-India ties, and high-ranking officials on both sides, Modi included, hailed them as positive signs of improving ties.  But the heralded abatement of mistrust and suspicions has yet to be consolidated, and Modi's mooted visit would not be conducive to bridging the rankling differences between the two neighbors and resolving their longstanding border issues.  According to a report in The Economic Times on Wednesday, the forthcoming visit is intended to send ""a strong signal"" to China that India is not deterred by China’s protests about Indian leaders' visits to the ""frontier state"".  Another provocation by India would not only elicit another protest, but also would further rock relations, which are already on shaky ground due to New Delhi’s concerns about and competition with Beijing for influence in the region.  Yet as two big countries in the region, the two neighbors have everything to gain by properly handling their differences and disputes. That requires that neither side take any action that might aggravate their border disputes.  Cooperation and competition are natural for such big neighbors, but they need to be mindful that they do not let their differences fuel their rivalry so that it turns to confrontation.  If, as the Indian media report suggests, Modi is planning a visit to the disputed border area, he should reconsider, as doing so would certainly not propel bilateral ties in the right direction.

Peninsula opportunity should not be spurned,1/3/2018,"                                                 The United Nations Security Council meets to discuss imposing new sanctions on North Korea, in New York, US, Dec 22, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Although the signs of easing animosity on the Korean Peninsula are welcome, the offer of talks from Kim Jong-un may represent merely a transient change of tone, rather than a shift in policy, and his overture is likely to come with a price tag.Kim's nice-guy approach may not last long, if Pyongyang fails to get what it covets. Be that the easing of sanctions, grain, oil or anything else that helps it subsist. Certainly that has been the case in several past attempts at ice-breaking.Yet, be that as it may, what matters now is whether the relevant parties can maneuver a meaningful break from the tense standoff that has developed on the peninsula.Since almost all stakeholders are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis, they should not let a chance like this slip by without giving it a try. Pyongyang has a poor track record credibility-wise. But what if it is seriously eager for engagement this time? United States President Donald Trump may very well be correct in observing Pyongyang's olive branch to Seoul shows ""sanctions and 'other' measures are beginning to have a big impact"".And the stakeholders have the option of substantially upgrading sanctions if Pyongyang does revert to past practices.Therefore, instead of flippantly and childishly claiming to have a ""much bigger and more powerful nuclear button"", the US president should try to be supportive of Seoul's enthusiasm for talking with Pyongyang.US UN envoy Nikki Haley says her country would not take any talks seriously since, instead of ""a Band-Aid"", they want Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons now.But a Band-Aid is exactly what Seoul wants while it hosts the Winter Olympics next month.And the intended dialogue on Olympic cooperation does have the potential to lead to further inter-Korean engagement.Kim reopened a key cross-border communication channel with the Republic of Korea for the first time in nearly two years on Wednesday, as the rivals explored the possibility of sitting down and talking after months of acrimony and fears of war.And Seoul has responded positively and agreed to talk next Tuesday on cooperation regarding the Winter Olympics. Such diplomatic pragmatism could serve Seoul well, at least for the duration of the games. However, it is to be hoped that something more substantive can be produced beyond that if the two sides can proceed in the current direction of engagement.         "
Misjudged appeal to public,1/3/2018,"                                             Opera Red Detachment of Women is staged at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing, capital of China, June 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   Should a performing troupe pay a scriptwriter for his or her work it has been performing? The answer should be in the affirmative as the playwright enjoys the intellectual property right to the work he or she wrote. This is common sense.Yet the National Ballet of China believes otherwise when it comes to the classic ballet The Red Detachment of Women, which it has staged for many years. A court ruled in 2015 that the ballet troupe should pay the writer 120,000 yuan ($18,500) in royalties and litigation expenses after the scriptwriter sued the company for using his script without paying for the right to do so.A higher level court rejected the troupe's appeal and upheld the original decision in 2017 and the money was transferred by force from the company's account in December. However, the National Ballet has been reluctant to accept the judgment, and it released a statement on the internet on Tuesday that has taken many people aback because of the way it accuses the judge of bending the law and dereliction of duty.What is ridiculous is the declaration's emphasis on the ballet itself as a revolutionary classic and an audience favorite. It seems that the ballet company's logic is no legal code has the right to prevent a revolutionary work from being performed for people who love it.If the declaration was not penned by a person muddle-headed about law, it must be an attempt by the troupe to woo public support in order to pressure the court to rescind its decision.Even though the ballet is a revolutionary classic and an audience favorite that has nothing to do with the ruling. It is the troupe's infringement on the rights of the scriptwriter that falls foul of the law.If the troupe finds the decision of the appeal court unacceptable, it may appeal to the Supreme People's Court for a further hearing of the case. There is no justification for it to issue such a declaration and point an accusing finger at the judge. These are acts in contempt of the courts and the law. If anything, the ballet troupe needs to be told that rather than trying to be a demagogue, it is subject to the rule of law.            "
Revised law will improve business environment,1/2/2018,"                          An employee counts yuan banknotes at a bank in Beijing, April 13, 2016.[Photo/Agencies]   The first day of the year marked further progress in China's efforts to improve its business environment, with a new Anti-Unfair Competition Law taking effect on Monday.  The new law aims to reflect the changed business landscape in the country and address the complaints about the lack of legal clarity on what constitutes bribery, which had created uncertainty over what may be offered as commercial incentives without crossing the line.  It has been common practice for companies doing business in China to build up connections using gifts and other forms of favors to clear the way and gain beneficial contracts, with the greasing of palms often deemed an acceptable, if not necessary, way of doing business.  While the Criminal Law covers bribery offenses in respect of enterprises and individuals in both the public and private sectors, the revised law covers commercial bribery whose purpose is to seek ""transaction opportunities or competitive advantage"".  Thus the new law prohibits not only the giving of money or property as bribes, but also other off-the-book kickbacks, and it follows international practice in stipulating that bribe recipients include third parties engaged by a transaction party.  It also stipulates tougher punishments for such practices. For example, an enterprise found to be involved in commercial bribery can now be fined up to 3 million yuan ($461,500) and may also have its business license revoked.Business entities, both domestic and foreign, will now have to strengthen their compliance systems to ensure they do not fall foul of the revised law. And while the law aims to maintain fair market competition and improve the business environment in China, it may also help State-owned enterprises investing in projects in other countries.  Tougher anti-corruption laws and more stringent compliance efforts — already specified as a major task during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) — will better prepare Chinese companies for the complex business environment overseas, which can only benefit them in the long run.  Meanwhile, in China, the revised law will necessarily promote a level playing field for law-abiding companies, whether Chinese or foreign.         "
Internal and external factors behind the protests in Iran,1/2/2018,"                          People protest in Tehran, Iran Dec 30, 2017 in this picture obtained from social media. [Photo/Agencies]   The anti-government demonstrations in Iran entered their sixth day on Tuesday, with growing attention focused on whether the government will be able to resolve the crisis and restore social stability at an early date without resorting to a violent response.  On the surface, the biggest social turmoil in Iran since 2009 has been triggered by dissatisfaction with unemployment, economic hardships and price hikes.  While President Hassan Rouhani has acknowledged there are genuine grievances, his challenge is convincing the protesters that he can meaningfully address them since there is no quick fix.  As a major OPEC oil producer and regional power, the fall in international oil prices since 2014 has dealt a heavy blow to Iran’s economy, which relies heavily on its exports of oil and natural gas.  And although Iran reached a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, the United States, instead of lifting its sanctions on Iran, has only slapped fresh sanctions on it, further worsening Iran’s economic outlook.  Yet it is not only domestic problems that have come to a head, like the social unrest in other countries in the Middle East in recent years, outside forces are also believed to be playing a role in the protests in Iran.  The longtime enmity between Teheran and Washington and the deep running rivalry between Teheran and Riyadh appear to also be factors behind the demonstrations.  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that Iran’s enemies had “united” to challenge the Islamic regime in the country, with President Rouhani singling out the US and Saudi Arabia for their interference.  Certainly, US President Donald Trump, who has taken an antagonistic stance toward Teheran since taking office, has tweeted several times in support of the protesters, saying it was “time for change”.  However, the region is in enough chaos as a result of the US’ military intervention in Iraq and the so-called Arab Spring uprisings it helped nurture.  Major players in the region, including the US and others from outside, should realize they too have a stake in maintaining peace and stability in Iran.         "
Diligence required for greater progress in 2018,1/1/2018,"                          The Guards of Honor of the People's Liberation Army perform the national flag-raising duty at the Tian'anmen Square in Beijing, Jan 1, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   As we ushered in 2018, many will no doubt have been reflecting on the year just passed. Such reviews help orientate us for the year ahead, but perhaps more important is identifying our goals for the coming year and how to attain them.  By reviewing the past, one can learn lessons and take stock of the year's experiences, but by making a detailed schedule of what is to be done and how, one has hopes and expectations that can drive one forward. The same is true for a nation.  As President Xi Jinping said in his speech on New Year’s Eve, we have enough reason to be proud of what this country has achieved in its scientific innovations in the year 2017, such as the launch of the C919 airliner, the X-ray satellite Insight, a quantum computer, the rice production in saline soil on a trial basis, the first China-made aircraft carrier and so on.  And what the government has done for the well-being of residents, such as the lifting of more than 10 million rural residents out of poverty and the construction of 6 million apartments for residents living in shanty towns, has provided more people with a strong sense of fulfillment, happiness and security.  However, just as President Xi said, happiness can only be achieved through hard work. What needs to be done warrants even harder endeavors from people of all walks of life and the governments at all levels, in particular for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, but much needs to be done to further them, which is indispensable for the country to achieve economic growth and social progress.  It is of vital importance for governments at all levels to have a strong sense of mission and responsibility in addressing what has been undesirable in the discharge of their duties and what has long been the source of citizens' complaints and dissatisfaction. That explains why President Xi called for a down-to-earth approach to whatever work needs to be done, and for governments and officials at all levels to keep the interests and concerns of the people in their hearts.  Only by lending their ears to the concerns of the people and being sincere in addressing these concerns will we be able to ""cut paths through mountains, and build bridges across rivers"" and so move forward.

New Year ray of hope shines for Korean Peninsula peace,1/1/2018,"                          The United Nations Security Council meets to discuss imposing new sanctions on North Korea, in New York, US, Dec 22, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   For ROK President Moon Jae-in, the New Year's Day message from his counterpart in the north will probably have come as something of a New Year's gift.  Although its past practices may contradict its claim to be a responsible nation, at least for now the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea seems to be acting as one by extending a ""welcome"" olive branch to the Republic of Korea .  While it might be, as speculated, simply an attempt to sow discord between the United States and the ROK, or simply a move to buy time for his nuclear/missile programs, it may perhaps be better to consider the DPRK’s offer to send a team to the coming Winter Olympics as a good-will answer to Moon's recent proposal to suspend joint military drills and view it as Seoul seems to be doing as the opening of a window of opportunity.  For despite the usual threat meant to deter the US from acting rashly, in this instance his statement that he has a nuclear button on his desk, Kim Jong-un did express an interest in ending the ""unstable state which is neither war nor peace"", as well as an eagerness to ""sit down for talks"". Better yet, the DPRK leader pledged to work with the ROK to ""lower military tensions on the Korean Peninsula"" with an eye on a ""peaceful resolution"".  While the reunification Kim Jong-un spoke of is more likely than not on his terms, and thus can be regarded as little more than a bid to remind Seoul of the current state of affairs, his speech may be a credible sign that Pyongyang does want, perhaps needs, to find a way to escape the spiraling tensions it has helped to foster.  Although there is a huge question mark surrounding the olive branch that has been offered — after all, the world has seen athletes from both sides of the 38th Parallel stand shoulder-to-shoulder under the Olympic banner, before and afterwards seen everything go back to as it was before; and Pyongyang’s past rhetoric about its desire for peace has repeatedly been offset by fresh provocations — that is no reason to give Kim’s overture the cold shoulder. Considering the clear and all too present danger being brewed by what have been recently rapidly escalating tensions, no sign hinting at a potential breakthrough should be ignored. Not least since this has been the first seemingly serious one from Kim since he became leader.         "
Deals of expediency will not bury the past,12/28/2017,"                                                 South Korea's President Moon Jae-In delivers a statement during the 19th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Republic of Korea Summit on the sidelines of the 31st ASEAN Summit and Related summits at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) in Manila, Philippines November 13, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   The Republic of Korea’s President Moon Jae-in was simply telling the truth when he said on Thursday that the 2015 agreement between his country and Japan intended to settle once and for all the decades-long row over Korean women forced into wartime sexual slavery was seriously flawed, “both in process and content”.His remarks came after a state-appointed panel concluded the ROK’s former government failed to properly communicate with the victims to get their consent on the deal and covered up the Japanese demands that Seoul avoid using the term “sexual slavery” — with Seoul agreeing to formally refer to the victims as “victims of Japanese military comfort stations” — and provide a specific plan to remove a bronze statue representing sex slaves in front of its embassy in Seoul.That is why the deal, though called “final and irreversible”, has never really resolved the highly emotional issue, which remains a thorn in bilateral relations, as proved by the continuation of weekly demonstrations in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. It was always an agreement struck on shaky ground, and Japan has been angry that Seoul hasn’t taken steps to remove the statue and similar memorials in the country, while it has fostered anger in the ROK as it failed to seek an explicit apology from the Japanese government for wartime abuses. It is not a question of money. The fund established under the 2015 deal provides 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to the surviving victims in the name of recovering their “honor and dignity” and healing their “psychological wounds”. It is about Japan shirking its responsibilities, as Tokyo stopped short of calling the money official government compensation, thereby refusing to acknowledge the Japanese government at the time systematically organized military sex enslavement. Historical records and memories of the victims themselves suggest that Japan forced tens of thousands of women from Korea and other Asian countries that it invaded during World War II to be sex slaves for its imperial army. Yet the current Japanese administration has been reluctant to acknowledge this, insisting that “comfort women” were recruited by civilians and that the army brothels were commercially operated.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once even said the women were not forced to be sex slaves as “there was no evidence to prove there was coercion as initially suggested”.Because of all this, the victims and their sympathizers have never accepted the deal, seeing it as political expediency. As Moon said, the agreement cannot resolve the comfort women issue.That can only happen when those in Japan who continue to insist on whitewashing the country’s wartime history face it squarely so that the past can be laid to rest.            "
Taking third step will herald big boost for bay economy,12/28/2017,"                          The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and associated tunnels cross the Lingdingyang waterway. [Photo/Xinhua]   On Wednesday, the country's top legislative body approved the co-location plan proposed by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to allow mainland officers to conduct immigration and customs clearance operations in the West Kowloon terminus of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong express rail link.  The decision by the National People's Congress Standing Committee came as no surprise as the implementation of boundary control at the Hong Kong terminus of the express rail link, or XRL as it is more conveniently known, is the only feasible choice if the infr**astructure project is to serve its purpose.  Under the arrangement passengers will go through the customs, immigration and quarantine procedures of the SAR and the Chinese mainland successively at the terminus in Hong Kong, with officials from the Chinese mainland working in a designated part of the station.  As anyone who has passed through the current physically separated boundary controls at Shenzhen will appreciate, the one-location boundary control will significantly quicken travel between the mainland and the SAR.  And since Hong Kong is the most visited city in the world, and welcomes a high number of international travelers, it makes sense to locate the boundary control at the West Kowloon terminus. Especially since it will help promote closer integration of the Pearl River Delta, which envisions the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area becoming the world's leading bay area in terms of GDP by 2030.  For the above purpose, convenient cross-boundary customs, immigration and quarantine procedures are crucial to realizing the high speed that is the XRL's defining feature. Without a co-location arrangement for boundary control at the West Kowloon terminus both the efficiency and economic benefits of the link would be greatly discounted.  The arrangement does not mean mainland laws will be applied throughout the SAR, only in a ""port area"" inside the XRL terminus. It is fully consistent with the ""one country, two systems"" policy, as it does not change the administrative system of Hong Kong or reduce in any way the Hong Kong government's high degree of autonomy. Nor does it impair the existing rights of Hong Kong residents.  Now that the first two steps of the ""three-step procedure"" for completing the co-location arrangement have been accomplished, the SAR government should initiate the last step-local legislation-as soon as possible.

Japan's defense spending raises more than eyebrows,12/28/2017,"                          Cai Meng/China Daily   Japan has been sending contradictory messages about its biggest warship, the Izumo, this week.  On Monday, Japanese media revealed that Japan is considering refitting the helicopter carrier so that it can carry the United States' F-35B stealth fighters, with a senior Defense Ministry official quoted as saying, ""if it is used for defense purposes, it will not fall under the category of an aircraft carrier with attack capabilities"", something prohibited under Japan's so-called pacifist Constitution.  One day later, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera denied the reports, saying ""no concrete examination"" on the introduction of the F-35B or refitting the Izumo is underway.  However, Japan's intentions for its Self-Defense Forces can be gauged by the Cabinet approving a record defense budget for fiscal 2018, under which the country's defense spending will rise 1.3 percent to reach 5.2 trillion yen ($46 billion). As a result, Japan's military spending will grow for the sixth consecutive year starting April, having grown about 10 percent since Shinzo Abe became Japan's prime minister for the second time in 2012.  Since then, Japanese politicians and media have deliberately hyped up the so-called assertiveness of China and the missile threat from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to justify Japan's ever-growing defense spending and pursue their goal of revising Japan's Constitution so the country has a full-fledged military.  A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to adhere to the policy of ""exclusive defense"" and stay committed to the path of peaceful development, saying China looked forward to seeing Japan act on its claim to be a force for peace with concrete policies and actions.  Without such policies and actions, Japan's growing defense budget will, for historical reasons, be viewed as a dangerous trend by its neighbors, and they will not be easily convinced that its growing defense spending is commensurate with its security needs.  It will be even harder for Japan to convince its neighbors that it is making efforts to become a ""normal country"" because what they have seen over the years suggests just the opposite, since Japan's right-leaning politicians have been alienating the country further from its neighbors by making it a disruptive force in the region.

Local govts can no longer pursue GDP with environmental impact,12/27/2017,"                          Saihanba National Forest Park, China's largest man-made woodland, in Weichang Manchu and Mongolian autonomous county in Chengde, Hebei province. [Photo/Xinhua]   A local leader may boast how well his city or province has done in protecting the local environment and ecosystems, but the central government has a series of standards and indexes to determine how much local officials have really done in these regards.  The National Bureau of Statistics, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and some other State and Party departments jointly released the results of analyzing these standards and indexes for 2016 on Monday. In the published results, such green development indexes as the utilization of resources, remedying contaminated soil or water, the environmental quality and the conservation of biosystems are listed for different provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. Also published is the degree of satisfaction with the local environment expressed by residents.  This is the first time such information has been published, and it is to become an annual practice. The releasing of the information means it is not just the central government that will know how well a local government has performed in protecting the environment and local ecosystems, but also ordinary residents.  There is little doubt that a local government will face more pressure from both the central government and its local residents when it comes to how it performs in dealing with the enterprises that discharge pollutants and with industrial accidents that have an environmental impact.  Along with inspections by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and heavier penalties for violations of the environmental protection law, as well as the strict requirement for polluters to pay compensation for the pollution they have caused, the publication of these indexes is a move to further tighten the noose on polluters.  It goes without saying that all the measures the central authorities have adopted are meant to bring home the message that local leaders must change their mentality about economic growth.  It is a blessing for all when local leaders show deserved concern for environmental protection, and it would be stupid for local leaders to take it for granted that they can pay off the central authorities with handsome GDP figures without showing concern for the GDP's impact on the environment.

US 'investment' in UN is for the common good,12/27/2017,"                          Song Chen/China Daily   US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley hailed a reduction in the United Nations' biennial operating budget on Sunday, calling it ""a big step in the right direction"".  The US managed to negotiate a cut of over $285 million in its contributions to the $5.396 billion budget for 2018-19 adopted by the UN General Assembly, with Haley declaring it meant the US ""will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of or remain unchecked"".  As her remarks came just a few days after more than 120 countries condemned the United States for its unilateral decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the implication was clear: The UN should support the US unconditionally if it wants its dollars.  That Washington regards the UN as a tool of US foreign policy was made evident by US President Donald Trump on Sept 18, when he said the US was ""not seeing results in line with US investment"".  The world's largest economy, the US is also the largest financial contributor to the UN-paying about 22 percent of the organization's core budget and 28 percent of its peacekeeping budget-and Trump has previously threatened to make deep cuts to the US' contributions if the UN failed to take a ""bold stand"" on the global mission he wants to define for it.  The US is in effect holding the UN to ransom on doing its bidding as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has admitted the cut in funding Trump was suggesting would create an ""unsolvable problem"" for the organization.  However, just because it is the biggest contributor to the UN does not give the US the mandate to impose its will on the intergovernmental body, which is tasked with promoting international cooperation and creating and maintaining international order, and whose 193 members, large and small, rich and poor, are supposed to have an equal say.  It is hypocritical for Washington to try to hide its intention by pointing an accusing finger at the UN for ""inefficiency and overspending"", as it is already a consensus among its members that the organization needs to cut its bureaucracy and improve its efficiency to better shoulder its responsibilities for international peace and security.  And it is wrong for the US to trumpet and practice ""dollar diplomacy"" at the expense of the UN's autonomy of action in pursuit of Trump's ""America First"" strategy.         "
Island expansion is discernibly reasonable,12/26/2017,"                      File Photo of Yongxing Island, home to the government of Sansha, China's southernmost city. [Photo/Xinhua]   Worrywarts upset themselves by worrying about troubles of their own imagining, and trigger mass hysteria if they find receptive ears for their fears. This is what keeps happening with China's so-called island building in the South China Sea.  This time it is a report by the overseas edition of People's Daily-with the remark that the country's permanent land area in the waters has ""expanded conspicuously"" after recent reclamation work-that seems to have given rise to the heebie-jeebies.  Not everyone likes China's claim of sovereignty over those islands and reefs, and its construction of various facilities, including defensive and radar installations, is viewed with dismay and concern. Likewise, the increasingly frequent long-distance patrol flights conducted by the People's Liberation Army Air Force have prompted all kinds of unnecessary speculation and interpretations.  However, as China's interests are extending globally, it would be shirking its responsibility if it did not seek to guarantee its expanding economic presence with due defense arrangements in this way.  In the end, all the fuss boils down to a matter of mentality-some people just find China's growing presence unsettling. Not least the United States, which views China's activities in the South China Sea as a challenge to what President Donald Trump asserted was his country's right to do as it pleased when he said, ""We dominate the sky. We dominate the sea. We dominate the land and space,"" while addressing US troops at Yokota Air Base in Japan at the start of his five-country visit to the region in November.  The US' efforts to shore up its self-aggrandizing dominance in the region in response to China's going out has led to its increasing militarization of the waters with its pivoting of US naval assets to the region and its habitual scare-mongering to bring its allies closer to heel.  But while there can be no denying China's role in the region is growing, and increasingly butting up against that of the US, that is to be expected as it is now the world's second-largest economy. And its growing influence is benefiting the region, as the ASEAN Foreign Ministers acknowledged at their meeting in August, welcoming the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' improved cooperation with China.  And it should be borne in mind that despite the various complaints and accusations of the US and some of its allies that have their own axes to grind, no detractor has actually nailed even one case of China obstructing freedom of navigation or overflight.  Such claims of concern about China's activities in the South China Sea illustrate vividly how things can be twisted to convey a message that has no foundation in fact.         "
Reluctance to join initiative not good for Indian economy,12/25/2017,"                      In contrast to the majority of the international community supporting or being involved in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, India still prefers to ignore it.  The issue featured at the 20th round of border talks between Chinese and Indian special representatives in New Delhi on Friday, too, according to Indian media reports. Regular dialogue between the two sides at the high level will help them bridge their differences in such fields as the border issue and India's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative.  India's resistance seems to stem from its concern over the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is designed to pass through Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan. But India needs to realize the CPEC is simply an economic project and there is no change in China's neutral stance on the Kashmir issue.  Since Beijing has no intention of playing any geopolitical game while promoting the Belt and Road Initiative in the region, New Delhi has no reason to view the CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed initiative, as anything but a connectivity and infrastructure endeavor for mutual benefit.  It wouldn't take much for India, if it indeed tries, to see the huge opportunities for better connectivity and economic cooperation the initiative offers to participating countries. China has been reiterating the initiative is a cross-continental development and cooperation platform, not a political tool, which focuses on providing regional public service.  Given today's interdependent world, India could miss the economic bus because of its skepticism while other countries reap the fruits of the Belt and Road Initiative.  On the bilateral level, India hopes to improve ties and deepen economic cooperation with China. So it should not ignore the initiative, as it is a mutually beneficial means to deepen cooperation, which in turn will help improve overall bilateral ties.         "
"For new sanctions to work, US must play positive role",12/25/2017,"                          The United Nations Security Council meets to discuss imposing new sanctions on North Korea, in New York, US, Dec 22, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   In what for diplomats in Beijing is a major achievement, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution which many believe would at once lower the likelihood of war, and convey a warning to Pyongyang.  Resolution 2397, the 10th UN Security Council has passed imposing sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is in the first place a sign of international solidarity against Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program. That, despite their differences, member countries have agreed to up the ante by imposing tougher sanctions reflects they still believe a peaceful, political, diplomatic solution to the Korean Peninsula problem is possible.  Given the resolution's meticulous detail, avoiding to inflict humanitarian losses and impair normal economic activities, the latest sanctions would prove a low-cost approach if they succeed in prompting Pyongyang back to the negotiation table. But for that to happen, the sanctions have to be enforced by all stakeholders in good faith, as Pyongyang appears determined and perhaps desperate to become a strong nuclear power.  The resolution did send a clear message to Pyongyang: the international community remains united-and is more determined-in stopping its nuclear/missile provocations and in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and it can achieve it peacefully.  Mixed as it is, the DPRK's response reveals considerable ambivalence. On the one hand, it has condemned the fresh sanctions as an ""act of war"" ""tantamount to complete economic blockade"", claiming again that nuclear deterrence is the only way to deal with the United States. On the other hand, it just decided to open a new ""economic development zone"" in Pyongyang to attract overseas investments.  Obviously, the DPRK can't have it both ways. It has to choose one or the other-definitely not both. It can't expect meaningful foreign investment with UN sanctions in place. It cannot use opening up economically as a ploy to undermine UN sanctions.  Beijing and Moscow have worked tirelessly to make sure the peninsula nuclear issue is resolved peacefully, without any political or economic implosion in the DPRK. If their own security interests have made both to seek a peaceful resolution, they will also prompt the two countries to prevent a nuclear-armed DPRK.  If Pyongyang chooses to repeat its stock tricks in defiance of the collective will of the international community, and Resolution 2379 does not yield expected results, there will be a collective move to further tighten the noose.  What happens next hinges to a great extent not only on what a choice Pyongyang makes, but also how Washington acts. And surely Pyongyang will view statements such as the one made by US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley on Friday as a provocation. If Washington is really sincere about bringing Pyongyang back to the negotiation table-which the international community certainly is-US officials should think before they talk.         "
Australia should consign to history its anti-China bias,12/22/2017,"                      There was once an ostensibly sweet honeymoon for Beijing and Canberra, when booming trade produced overwhelming optimism about the mutually beneficial nature and bright prospects of bilateral ties.  But what has been happening in Australia recently is a stark reminder that it may not be the kind of friend many in China have thought it to be.  If Australian media's political witch hunt targeted at ""Chinese influences"", Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's undisguised China-bashing, and the legislative moves aimed at restraining so-called foreign infiltration have soured government-to-government relations, recent reports of attacks on Chinese citizens studying in Australia have further tarnished the country's image in the eyes of the Chinese public.  The recent Australian hysteria over ""Chinese influence"" in the country, which has been conspicuous in public offices and among private citizens, calls for both the Chinese government and ordinary Chinese citizens to recalibrate their previous, possibly overly optimistic views about Australia as a country.  Beijing wants little more beyond Australia's rich reserves of natural resources, yet Canberra, while hungry for Chinese money, is deeply suspicious of its intentions, as revealed in Australia's recent foreign policy white paper. China is thus an easy scapegoat for Australia's domestic troubles in the local political in-fighting.  Australia has been a favored trading partner of China for good reasons. But there is no guarantee this will continue to be the case if the political climate in Australia continues to be hostile. After all, from the perspective of materials supply, Australia is far from irreplaceable. Nor is it in terms of education or tourism, two sectors of the Australian economy that have benefited tremendously from Chinese spending.  Australia's recent appeal to Chinese students lies largely in its low threshold. And the country was known as a safe, tourist-friendly destination. If incidents of bodily harm targeted specifically at Chinese nationals continue growing, there can be little doubt Chinese parents will think twice before sending their children to study there. Likewise, travelers will opt for more friendly places.  That all Chinese consulates in Australia have simultaneously issued safety alerts after recent cases of Chinese students being insulted or attacked is unprecedented in recent memory. It reveals the severity of the situation in the eyes of our diplomatic missions.  Time moves on, Australia should not try to cling to the certainty of an outdated past because it fears the uncertainties brought about by change. The bias against China being pandered by some in Australia only reveals it needs to shake off its Cold War mentality so it can step confidently into the present.         "
DPP playing reckless game,12/22/2017,"                                             Taiwan's New Party spokesman Wang Ping-chung maintained on Thursday that he has never received any funds from organizations affiliated with the Communist Party of China, as claimed by the Democratic Progressive Party-led authorities on the island, following his and three other party members' arrests in alleged connection with an espionage investigation. Wang made the remarks at a news conference one day after he, his father, and three fellow members of the New Party were taken to the Taipei district prosecutors' office for questioning. That they support peaceful reunification between the mainland and the island, and have disclosed and criticized ""Taiwan independence"" forces on various occasions, is the real reason they were investigated. Since the independence-minded DPP came to office, relentless measures have been taken to crack down on those who do not support the DPP's separatist stance. For example, some assets affiliated to the Kuomintang have been classified as ""improper party assets"" in an attempt to ruin the main opposition party. A campaign has also been launched to pursue ""political cases"" involving the Kuomintang to tarnish its reputation, as part of a plan to promote its ""spiritual collapse"" . The DPP has gone all out to set traps for those on the island who support cross-Straits exchanges and peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Straits. A regulation was revised by the DPP last year, which sets limits on any retired Taiwan military official visiting the mainland and threatens to deprive any that do so of their pensions. The charge against Wang and others and their arrests came amid the DDP's accelerated measures to portray the mainland as an ""enemy"" and its claims that it is taking measure to ensure the island's ""safety"". With the DPP authorities persecuting parties and people who support peaceful reunification, one can't help but wonder where they are heading.         "
Meeting charts course for growth in new era,12/21/2017,"                          President Xi Jinping addresses the Central Economic Work Conference in Beijing. The conference was held from Monday to Wednesday. XIE HUANCHI / XINHUA   High-quality development and prevention of major risks are top of the agenda in the policy road map laid out at this year's Central Economic Work Conference, which wrapped up on Wednesday.  The policy objectives and directions outlined in the road map will not only guide the Chinese economy through the coming year, they are also crucial to the long-term development of the world's second-largest economy.  Over the more than three decades since the launch of reform and opening-up, China has maintained an impressive growth rate that has propelled it to become the world's second-largest economy. However, the years of no-holds-barred expansion have caused a pile-up of problems and risks that can no longer be put aside.  As General Secretary Xi Jinping stated at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, the country has entered a new era where ""uneven and inadequate development"" is at odds with ""people's ever-growing demands for a better life.""  It was made clear then that the country will seek to meet those demands and transition to more balanced, sustainable and efficient development by relaxing the growth targets in pursuit of higher quality growth. The Central Economic Work Conference has added flesh to the bones of how that higher quality is to be pursued.  The drive to contain leverage and prevent financial risks is to the fore in these efforts, initial headway having been made since the financial authorities tightened regulation last year, with liquidity growth slowed significantly, local government debt under control, and financial irregularities reduced.  The risk control efforts will be further strengthened next year in order to forestall major risks and resolutely fight irregular and illegal financial activities.  Although China's economic growth has slowed this year, it has also shown marked improvements, as the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences highlighted in its annual outlook, and this trend is expected to continue next year with the tightening of financial oversight and property price control and the strengthening of environmental protection.  While it can be expected that the road ahead will not be smooth, especially given the trade headwinds that seem set to gather strength because of the economic nationalism of the current US administration, China's leaders will determinedly push ahead with their efforts to achieve their goal of realizing higher quality growth, which is the fundamental requirement for ""addressing all problems"", as Xi has said.

Beijing working to narrow Israeli-Palestinian divide,12/21/2017,"                          US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (R, front) vetoes a UN Security Council draft resolution on the status of Jerusalem at the UN headquarters in New York, on Dec 18, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   The two-day peace symposium for representatives from Israel and Palestine that started in Beijing on Thursday couldn't have come at a more timely moment given US President Donald Trump's decision to ignore UN resolutions and unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec 6.  That decision has basically invalidated Washington playing the role of peace broker in the region, and made it imperative that someone step into the breach by assuming that role.  The fact that China maintains close relations with both Israel and Palestine and has long advocated greater efforts to resolve their differences means it is well-positioned as a well-intentioned interlocutor to assume the role of mediator.  Unlike the United States changing its decades-long policy to side entirely with Israel on this most sensitive and complex issue, China has long promoted a resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine in pursuit of a peaceful settlement. As shown by the symposium in Beijing, which has been accepted as a platform of communication by both sides. Nabil Shaath, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' foreign relations adviser, and Hilik Bar, deputy speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, are leading the teams.  It would be unrealistic to expect any breakthrough at the symposium, which was arranged long before Trump announced his self-serving decision. Yet it shows that unlike the US, whose move runs roughshod over hopes the new administration might be able to navigate a way to talks, China is committed to the conciliation of the two sides.  In particular, its proposal to use the Belt and Road Initiative-in which both Israel and Palestine are identified as important participants-to propel economic growth and improve people's livelihoods in the Middle East offers a practical means of bringing the two sides closer together and promoting peace.  While the US seems intent on bullying other countries into supporting Trump's quid pro quo decision-with US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley threatening the US would be ""taking names"" on a nonbinding General Assembly vote on Thursday criticizing Trump's decision-China will continue to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to talk, in the belief that a negotiated settlement, including an agreement on Jerusalem being the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states, is the only way to secure lasting peace.

Tough environmental protection task,12/20/2017,"                      Environmental protection volunteers exposed two illegal hazardous waste dumps in the suburbs of Lanzhou, capital of Northwest China's Gansu province, on Monday. Thousands of cubic tons of carbon blocks and waste residue from the electrolyzing of aluminum have been buried under a thin layer of earth or piled up in the open air in two valleys near a village of 2,700 residents. The carbon blocks, dumped by the State-owned Aluminum Corporation of China Limited's Lanzhou branch, contain large amounts of highly toxic fluoride and cyanide, which are soluble in water, contaminating the groundwater and soil. The company has vowed to take immediate action to clean up the sites and hold accountable those responsible. But this is not the first time it has been caught illegally dumping hazardous waste. It has been investigated and punished by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Lanzhou environmental protection bureau in 2013, 2015, 2016, and as recently as September, for air pollution and the improper disposal of solid industrial waste. In September, after paying a fine and dismissing six executives, the company, which must have thought the dust had settled down, carried on dumping the waste as it did before until the volunteers exposed what they were doing in the two valleys. The proper disposal method is to grind the toxic solid waste, mix the powder with limestone and cement and then bury the mixture deep in designated toxic waste landfills. Although the Ministry of Environmental Protection's orders have finally been carried out by the local environmental watchdog, the government's environmental protection system has played its role without doing its job. This shows the challenge the country faces in pursuing green development in the poorer inland areas, where the tax revenue of even the polluting enterprises remains indispensable for local governments. The local environment watchdogs turn a blind eye to pollution as long as companies pay the compulsory fines when the watchdogs are forced to act.         "
UN Security Council vote was more than an insult,12/20/2017,"                      US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (R, front) vetoes a UN Security Council draft resolution on the status of Jerusalem at the UN headquarters in New York, on Dec 18, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   Rather than blame the rest of the United Nations Security Council members for opposing its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Washington should reflect on the significance of it having to use its veto instead of pettily calling it, as US UN Ambassador Nikki Haley did, ""an insult"" that ""won't be forgotten"".  Unfortunately, even after the 14 other UNSC members voted for the Egyptian-drafted resolution calling for the United States to rescind its decision, the US remains determined to go its own way, violating UN Security Council resolutions that make clear no country can unilaterally decide that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.  Not surprisingly the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world have been outraged by US President Donald Trump's decision, as the status of the city is a central issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and his announcement has been interpreted as a declaration the US is siding with Israel.  For even while the new US National Security Strategy claims a continuous commitment to ""helping facilitate a comprehensive peace agreement that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians"", Trump's announcement on Jerusalem has been a fresh cut in an old wound that only further antagonizes the two peoples.  Contrary to Haley's disingenuous words, its veto on Monday had nothing to do with US sovereignty, as clearly it is not simply a disagreement over where it locates its embassy, and in no way does its decision contribute to the US playing the role of peacemaker in the Middle East.  ""We must be realistic about our expectations for the region without allowing pessimism to obscure our interests or vision for a modern Middle East,"" states the US administration's newly released National Security Strategy document.  Yet its decision regarding the status of Jerusalem shows Washington is anything but realistic about expectations, and its vision has been obscured by dangerous underestimation of the complexity and sensitivity surrounding the Holy City.  That 14 countries on the UN Security Council, including some of Washington's closest allies, endorsed the motion, which called for rescinding decisions and actions meant to alter the character, status or demographic composition of Jerusalem, is not an insult, it is more than simply a loss of face for Washington. The rare diplomatic frustration offers a serious history lesson for the Trump administration, one it would do well to heed.  While there is nothing wrong in Trump's pledge to ""look at the world with clear eyes and fresh thinking"", or indeed in his bid to ""promote a balance of power that favors the United States"", his statement on Jerusalem has resulted in ""America first"" becoming ""America alone"" for a reason.

US' national security strategy is still a work in progress,12/19/2017,"                          US President Donald Trump delivers remarks regarding the Administration's National Security Strategy at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington D.C., US December 18, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   While highlighting the areas of cooperation with China, US President Donald Trump also identified it as a strategic competitor when he unveiled his national security strategy on Monday.  This is not the first time Washington has defined its ties with Beijing in this way.  Former president George W. Bush also described China as a strategic competitor when he first came to office. Yet over time, Bush came to see China as a ""responsible stakeholder"", paving the way for years of stability in Sino-US relations.  Likewise, despite his China-bashing rhetoric on the campaign trail, Trump has changed his tune since entering the White House, expressing the wish to build ""an even stronger relationship between the US and China"".  This is recognition of the fait accompli, for despite their differences, their interests are increasingly interwoven, and as Trump indicated there are many areas of cooperation.  And with the Trump administration saying the strategy outlined in the speech reflects ""principled realism"" in addressing global threats, there is clearly room for the two sides to work more closely together, not least on issues of common concern such as the nuclear weapons program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  However, that is on the one hand. On the other, with Trump promoting economic strength as being indispensable for national security, there are likely to be exacerbated frictions over trade, where the two countries are already at odds, with the US following an all-for-itself-path and China advocating further global trade and investment liberalization for the benefit of all.  It is clear that the incumbent administration feels that US is somehow being taken advantage of in trade matters, even though this likely stems from it looking back to a time that has been and gone. Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster has hailed the new strategy as a means to help the country reclaim the strategic confidence it had under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, saying the US had vacated a lot of competitive space in recent years.  Yet it is hard to see how the instinct to withdraw from its global leadership commitments, not least combating the real and pressing threat of climate change, will be reconciled with the inclination to make ""America great again"" - which suggests that we may be in for a bumpy ride.                                                "
China no longer willing to pay environmental cost,12/19/2017,"                                             Only those who profit from the practice are likely to disagree with the proposition that those who damage the environment should bear the costs of remedying the harm they cause. And given the fact that more than half of the country's rivers and lakes have been seriously polluted and vast stretches of farmland have been contaminated with toxic heavy metals in some provinces, the country can no longer afford to let polluters get away with their dirty deeds. Getting industry to pay to clean up its mess has been long overdue. Now the environmental damage compensation mechanism that has been successfully trialed in Chongqing municipality and Jilin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces since 2015, is to be rolled out across the country on Jan 1, which means polluting companies and individuals will have to repair the damage they do to the environment or else pay compensation. In the most recent case, a company in Guizhou province was ordered to pay more than 9 million yuan ($1.36 million) to treat the environmental damage caused by the sewage it discharged. The move to extend the mechanism nationwide makes a lot of sense as, in addition to protecting people from potential harm and taxpayers from having to pay the cost of environmental rehabilitation, the trial has also shown that making polluters pay is an effective means of reducing the harm done to the environment in the first place. Having the onus to clear up any mess they make means enterprises are more willing to upgrade their facilities to reduce the pollutants they discharge and the risks of any accidents that may cause environmental damage. The move shows the country is committed to a change of approach that attaches more importance to the quality rather than the quantity of economic development, in order to ensure there are lush mountains and clean rivers. The days when environmental pollution was the price the country was willing to pay for its rapid economic growth are now in the past. Hopefully, local governments will now carry out the polluter-pays game plan to the letter and show no leniency to those that harm the environment.                                 "
Parties must say no to war and chaos on Peninsula,12/18/2017,"                      As the only party to come up with a relatively comprehensive prescription for ending the protracted wrangling over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear weapons program, with its proposal that the United States and the Republic of Korea suspend joint military drills and Pyongyang to suspend nuclear/missile tests, Beijing is trying everything possible to make sure that war and chaos do not materialize on the Korean Peninsula. Its latest proposal again calls for restraint and mutual non-provocation. Thankfully the other parties - with Tokyo perhaps the sole exception - also seem to find a political solution more preferable now. After talking with President Xi Jinping, visiting ROK President Moon Jae-in fully endorsed Beijing's ""no war, no chaos"" position in a Friday speech at Peking University, even offering a bright future for the DPRK if it ""makes the right choice"". And remarkably both Pyongyang and Washington have highlighted a desire for peace while affirming no giving in to provocations, something they both reiterated at a ministerial-level meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday. Since the shared will is there, the question now is how to deliver on it. Beijing's latest proposal for resolving the crisis boils down to the parties concerned using restraint, fully implementing UN resolutions and resorting to engagement. The DPRK and the United States are the parties directly concerned and they need to talk if there is to be a peaceful final settlement of the issue. However, there remains a lack of trust that both sides need to make efforts to overcome. It would be great if US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's earlier offer of unconditional talks were to be backed up by the White House as then it might be taken seriously by Pyongyang, which in turn should respond to the US president's call for proper conditions for talks. On Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the standoff on the Korean Peninsula ""the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today"", and it is reaching a critical juncture where all players in the game need to conduct a reality check and make an informed choice, or end up losing big. As Beijing urges, the parties concerned should exercise restraint and do all they can to seek engagement.   (China Daily 12/18/2017 page8)                                 "
Ministry right to turn up the heat on local governments,12/18/2017,"                      Over the past couple of days, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has sent out 839 groups on fact finding missions to determine how heating is supplied in Beijing, Tianjin and 26 cities around the two municipalities. They will check whether heating has been supplied to all residents, whether those boilers using natural gas as fuel have been supplied with gas in a timely manner, whether those households using electricity to heat their homes enjoy discounted electricity and whether the supply of coal has been guaranteed for those households which still have to burn coal for heating. Local governments will be urged to do whatever they can to mend their ways if heating is found not to be supplied as it should. The inspections are more than necessary as the temperature has dropped dramatically in most parts of the country, northern China in particular, and some local governments have carried out the clean energy program to substitute natural gas for coal too hastily. As a result, some coal-burning boilers and coal-burning stoves in some villagers' homes have been demolished before natural gas has been supplied. It is definitely environmentally friendly to substitute natural gas for coal, the burning of which has proved to be an important source of air pollution in winter. However, the program must be carried out in an orderly manner. Local governments must see to it that local residents have heating throughout the winter. There is no reason for local leaders to shelf central government policies, but neither should they turn a blind eye to any negative effects the improper implementation of the policies may have. President Xi Jinping once said that governing a big country is like cooking a dish, meaning what seasonings are used and how much, as well as how long it takes to cook the dish makes a great difference to the final dish. The same is true when carrying out a policy. Often times, it is not the policy that is problematic, rather it is the way the policy is carried out. Just like cooking a dish, no matter how good the preparation, care must be taken in the cooking to ensure it turns out right.   (China Daily 12/18/2017 page8)                           "
Repercussions of Fed's rate rise can be easily absorbed,12/15/2017,"                          [Photo: VCG]   In a vote of confidence in economic growth and job gains, the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. It was the third time this year the Fed has raised the rate, and it projects three more increases next year.  The move, though expected, will cause ripples around the world. One concern that has been raised is the higher returns in the United States could lure capital out of developing countries, including China.  But the Fed first raised its rates from nearly zero in December 2015 as the country recovered from the 2008-09 recession, and the scenario of massive capital outflows from China never really materialized.  And in response to tightened supervision and a stable yuan against the US dollar and other major currencies, China's foreign exchange reserves rebounded to $3.11 trillion in October from $2.99 trillion in January, according to the central bank, suggesting capital inflows.  China remains a major magnet for foreign investors, thanks to its efforts to create a level playing field for businesses. In its latest move, foreign business will be allowed to own up to 51 percent of shares in joint ventures in securities, funds or futures, with the cap phased out in three years.  Another worry that has been voiced is China's growing US dollar-denominated debt may make it harder for the country to pay back debt as the greenback appreciates. But that worry also seems overblown.  China's outstanding foreign debts totaled $1.42 trillion at the end of 2016, a level comparable to other major countries, and as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said, the risk level remains controllable.  Besides, the authorities have already taken steps to deleverage so as to contain financial risks arising from excessive borrowing. Government reforms to reduce excessive capacity in zombie enterprises have also helped cut corporate credit.  The Fed's rate hikes are part of its normalization of rates, whose repercussions can be easily absorbed if China continues to guard against financial risks while pushing ahead with restructuring that focuses more on quality than quantitative growth.

No interference will be brooked in internal affairs,12/15/2017,"                          A mannnequin is thrown from a US-made Black Hawk helicopter during an annual military drill in Taichung, central Taiwan, on January 17, 2017. [Photo: VCG]   Beijing has never conceded and will not yield an inch on Taiwan being part of China. It is a matter that leaves no room for negotiation.  This seems to be something that needs restating since the provisions concerning Taiwan in the National Defense Authorization Act, signed by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, constitute a potential provocation to China, as they include consideration of port calls to the island by the US Navy, among other measures aimed at strengthening defense ties with the island.Such provisions may be intended as a bargaining chip or increasing the geostrategic pressure on China. If so, Trump should be informed that not everything is negotiable, and too much pressure can have unintended, even though anticipatable, consequences.  Although the US may be bound by domestic law to provide the island with the means to defend itself-a legacy of history and perhaps the lingering view that the island be considered an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier""-China resolutely opposes any meddling in its internal affairs, and it has made that clear in the protest it has lodged against the content relating to China's sovereignty in the act.  Should the US breach the three communiqués, which in their pledges to respect each other's national sovereignty and territorial integrity are the very foundation for relations between the two countries, Beijing will have every reason to do whatever it considers appropriate to deal with the subsequent crisis in its best interests.  However, while the use of military force for the reunification of the island with the motherland is always an option on the table for Beijing, as its anti-secession law dictates, it has long sought to realize this by peaceful means, which is in the interests of people on both sides of the Straits. This remains the case today. On Wednesday, Beijing again made clear it was willing to communicate with any political party, organization or individual who adheres to the one-China principle.  However, there are those on the island who have become emboldened in their separatist intention by recent US posturing, and they have pinned their hopes on arms sales and military intervention from the United States for the realization of their untenable aspiration.  Washington should not give sustenance to their fantasies. US policymakers would do well to bear in mind there is a line that should not be crossed when it comes to Taiwan.         "
Washington and Pyongyang must back words with actions,12/14/2017,"                                                 File photo of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. [Photo/Agencies]   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday offered to start direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. ""Let's just meet,"" Tillerson said in a speech in Washington, moving away from the stumbling block of the United States' previous demand that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear arsenal.  The softening of US position seems to be in response to Pyongyang's expressed desire for direct talks with Washington, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week he had passed on to his US counterpart.The possibility of talks when the worst-case scenario seemed to be looming ever nearer would certainly be welcome.  The problem is whether Tillerson's words count. If Pyongyang is to take the message seriously, Washington at least has to speak in one voice. Hours after Tillerson said the two countries could meet and just talk about the weather if that is what it took to get the ball rolling, the White House said President Donald Trump's views on the issue ""had not changed"".  Trump has previously said that the secretary of state was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with"" Pyongyang, and the US will do ""what has to be done"". Such rhetoric, in addition to the massive joint military drills between the US and the Republic of Korea on the peninsula, including the biggest-ever joint air exercise last week, will have only increased Pyongyang's sense of insecurity, and made it more desperate than ever to secure its survival with nuclear weapons.  But, on the other hand, Pyongyang can't have its cake and eat it too. It cannot expect Washington to engage in direct peace talks with it, while at the same time making such talks more difficult by continuing with its missile launches and nuclear tests in defiance of the United Nations resolutions that ban such reckless moves.  A ""period of quiet"", as Tillerson put it, is indispensable if the deep-rooted distrust between the two sides is to be eased.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea should realize that bolstering up its nuclear force does not make it safer, rather it threatens catastrophe to itself and the region.  To avoid the worst-case scenario, the US and the DPRK must waste no time in engaging in direct talks and discussing more than just the weather.         "
Recalling Nanjing helps improve ties with Japan,12/14/2017,"                                                 Students attend a ceremony held at an exhibition on the Nanjing Massacreat the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing, on Dec 13, 2017. [Photo by Zou Hong/China Daily]   It has been said that history is little more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind. But there is a reason for that, since looking back it can usually be seen that, however complex or obscure their causes, the events are usually the result of similar fervors.  By choosing to remember what we do, we express the hope that the past can serve to guide us to a better future by reminding us of where our frenzies may lead.  Thus, instead of being intended to ferment enmity between China and Japan, the National Memorial Service held to mark the 80th Anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre on Wednesday was meant as a historical reminder that both Chinese and Japanese peoples should treasure friendly bilateral relations.It is not, as some suggest, because Chinese people are obsessed with that part of history, but rather because there are some in its neighbor who are. Since there are those in Japan who would betray their country's future by obscuring that part of its past to generations to come, rather than allow them to comprehend the cultural legacies that resulted in the shameful acts they seek to erase.  The protests by Chinese and Korean people as well as people from other countries at the denials by some Japanese politicians of the crimes Japanese troops committed during their imperialist war of aggression sends a clear message that they will not be able to rewrite the past and their selective amnesia only exacerbates the wrongs they seek to hide.  Chinese people do not draw attention to the past because they hate an entire nation, but because of the irresponsibility of those who try to wipe the slate clean when teaching the lessons of history. It is they who allow no forgiving and moving on, since they seek to deny that any wrong has been done.The memorial service to remember what happened in Nanjing was thus in the interests of Japan as well as China, as it was a cue for the shared memory of both peoples, and only by fully comprehending those pages of history can future chapters be written in the true spirit of friendship.

Trump can lead way in space by encouraging cooperation,12/13/2017,"                                                 US astronaut Buzz Aldrin wearing his space suit practices to move in weightlessness aboard a plane on July 9, 1969 seven days before Apollo XI space mission launch to the moon. [Photo: VCG]   Having faced a lot of flak recently, US President Donald Trump may have found some relief in the widespread support he received for the new space policy directive he signed on Monday.  Promising to ""restore American leadership in space"", he called on Americans to imagine the possibilities of ""daring to dream big"" when he announced that his administration is planning to send astronauts to the moon once again.It's a smaller dream than his predecessor's, for whom the moon was always a case of been there, done that. But then it is the more pragmatic way to get to Mars.  For without sufficient funding or help from nations such as China, NASA will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind, as a report by the National Research Council bluntly pointed out.  All Trump's predecessors, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, dreamed of ambitious space missions to boldly go where no man had gone before, only for each of them to see their grandiose visions fall by the wayside, mainly because of the mammoth costs involved and budget constraints.  Trump's business acumen may come in handy this time, as a White House statement said he will ""create incentives"" for private industry and cooperation with other nations is on the cards. There has already been talk of the United States and Russia collaborating on a lunar space station.  And it would certainly be a giant leap forward if the US could abandon its policy that bans NASA from engaging in bilateral agreements and coordination with China regarding space.  Although a latecomer to space, China has made tremendous progress. It is now on track to launch its first Mars probe around 2020 and build a space station around 2022.  While harking back to the times when the US considered itself great having won the space race, Trump should bear in mind that times have changed. Investment in the space program will no doubt lead to increased job creation, innovation and military applications as the administration claims, but the US should commit to the peaceful use of space and look to forge increased cooperation with other spacefaring countries.  For a future inspired by journeys of exploration and discovery among the stars has been a shared dream of humans since we first wondered about the heavens.         "
Moon should seize chance to reset ROK's positioning,12/13/2017,"                                                 President Xi Jinping (R) meets with Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in in Da Nang, Vietnam, Nov 11, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]   Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in's four-day state visit to China that begins on Wednesday is certainly another sign that there has been a thaw in the recently chilly China-ROK relationship.  But pleasant as it will no doubt be to the ears of his hosts, his promise not to use the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system for purposes other than preventing nuclear/missile threats from Pyongyang, will be difficult to verify in practice.  Nor will his appeal for the two sides to view the matter from each other's perspective mitigate Beijing's worries about THAAD's potential threat to national security.  Seoul should not assume Beijing will simply drop the matter just because its deployment in the ROK is now a fait accompli. It should honor the pledges it has made to Beijing.  However, although a complete thawing of relations may be a long and difficult process with THAAD in the way, Moon's attempt to assuage Chinese concerns does offer a starting point for repairing relations.  And it is essential both parties are pragmatic. They need to show a shared sense of urgency in working together on the imperative task of defusing the dangerous time-bomb ticking on the Korean Peninsula.  Although Beijing and Seoul both oppose the military option, they have yet to sit down and talk about what non-military alternatives are available, and feasible.  And though Moon has on multiple occasions expressed opposition to any military strike as an option for dealing with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, his government has displayed little hesitancy in joining the United States' tit-for-tat saber-rattling when responding to Pyongyang's provocations.If Pyongyang's missile test on Nov 29 and the US-ROK joint drill that followed were any indication, neither side seems ready to embrace the ""dual suspension"" proposal that Beijing and Moscow have long stood by. Nor is there any sign that the Six-Party Talks can be resumed any time soon. On the contrary, there has been growing pessimism about the possibility of a political resolution after a United Nations envoy returned from Pyongyang.  President Moon's visit presents a precious opportunity for China and the ROK to engage in serious discussion about how to engage Pyongyang and Washington in pursuit of a peaceful end to the crisis.

Australia's opportunist move likely to run into stone wall,12/12/2017,"                      Despite strong criticism from Australian Chinese and indignation from China, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull seems determined to play his new role as China-basher-in-chief. His enthusiasm for the part is casting a dark shadow on the formally bright prospects for bilateral cooperation between the two countries.After making China a scapegoat for his country's intention to crack down on external interference in domestic politics last week, Turnbull said on Saturday both in English and Mandarin that ""the Chinese people have stood up"" and ""the Australian people stand up"", showing he intends to continue pandering to the anti-China bias of some in Australia.Many may find it unfathomable why Turnbull and some other politicians and local media outlets are all of a sudden targeting China, their country's largest trading partner. After all, there is no issue left over by history or fundamental interest clash between the two countries.Instead, Australia owes much of its economic prosperity in recent years to China's huge demand for its natural resources. And there has been increasing Australian public recognition of the importance of developing a healthy and growing relationship with China in the Australian society.Yet, Turnbull has chosen to lead the anti-China chorus that has emerged, seemingly basing his judgment on false media reports of China's so-called attempt to seek political influence in Australia. While Turnbull may be conveniently exploiting the anti-China sentiment in Australia for his own political gains, there is no denying there has been a longtime political bias against China in Australia. It has voluntarily served as the vanguard of the United States' efforts to contain China's rise in recent years. Last month, its 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper emphasized the importance of consolidating its alliance with the US and pointing its finger at China as a threat to the world order.Australia's outdated Cold War mentality has naturally influenced the country's perspective on China and led to its opportunistic practice in foreign policy toward China. That well explains why some Australian politicians seem to be quite content to pursue economic ties with China on the one hand while decrying what they say is the county's reliance on China on the other hand.Any far-sighted politician would know such schizophrenic behavior cannot go on forever without running into a stone wall.

Germany's cyber espionage allegations are an old trick,12/12/2017,"                      German Chancellor Angela Merkel shakes hands with Hans-Georg Maassen, President of Germany's Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BfV), the domestic intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Germany, following their meeting at the BfV's headquarters in Cologne October 31, 2014. [Photo: VCG]   Germany's intelligence agency BfV has claimed that China is using fake LinkedIn profiles as a means of spying on German officials and politicians, alleging it is part of a ""broad-based attempt to infiltrate in particular parliaments, ministries and government agencies"", as BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen put it.That is a very serious allegation, and BfV needs to provide evidence to support it.Instead, BfV seems to be just ""giving a dog a bad name to hang him"", since there has been no verified damage found, no suspects arrested, no specific victims identified.It is not the first time that China has been singled out by Germany as a scapegoat for activities in cyberspace. Earlier this year, reports about a wave of attacks by Chinese hackers on Germany's high-tech companies hit the headlines, with BfV saying in May it had evidence that a Chinese hacker group was behind the hacking campaign.Sensational enough, but all the reports and claims were later found to be void of any proof.And this is an old trick. Germany is not the first country to point accusing fingers at China without any evidence to support its allegations; it is also a favorite pastime of the United States.Which is somewhat ironic since there is evidence to show that the US engages in cyberspying, including against Germany, thanks to the revelations of the whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information from the US National Security Agency.And BfV may do better by starting its investigation this time with the US military, since there have been reports it has been developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations. This may yield more substantial results, given Uncle Sam's track record.China too is the victim of cyberattacks, and it is seeking to enhance its own cybersecurity by strengthening its finance, energy, telecommunications and transport information infrastructure.However, it believes cyber crimes are a common enemy of the international community and has called for deeper cooperation among nations to build an international cyber community with a shared future.

Arctic gas terminal  begins Ice Silk Road,12/10/2017,"                      Two COOEC employees put up a scaffold on a ship in Qingdao, Shandong province. [Photo by Yu Fangping/For China Daily]   While translating Russia's rich energy reserves into a badly needed boost for its economy, the Yamal liquefied natural gas project, which aims to tap natural gas reserves totaling more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, also promises benefits for China.  As the majority stakeholder with 50.1 percent, Russia's Novatek is undoubtedly the biggest winner from the project, and Russian President Vladimir Putin was right to call Yamal’s inauguration a ""significant moment"" for the Russian economy, energy industries, polar exploitation, and his country's Northern Sea Route on Friday.  But the facility is also a good investment for the French company Total, which has a 20 percent stake and for China, as its National Petroleum Corporation and the Silk Road Fund hold a combined 29.9 percent stake.  The Arctic gas terminal is expected to supply China with 4 million tons of LNG a year, which will help to considerably mitigate the short supply of LNG, which has been prominent in the north of China recently, and facilitate the country’s shift to clean energy sources.  Also since the Yamal gas project is far inside the Arctic Circle, the LNG is being shipped to China via the Northern Sea Route, which enables it to reach China in 15 days, shaving almost 20 days off the regular time using the traditional route through the Suez Canal. The shipping lane running between the Pacific and the Atlantic along Russia’s northern coast offers precious support for the Ice Silk Road envisaged by China and Russia.  The northern economic route was officially incorporated into China's Belt and Road Initiative in June as a means to strengthen its energy security and benefit its foreign trade by reducing shipping costs.  The Yamal liquefied natural gas project is therefore a move of lasting, strategic significance for both countries, and its successful inauguration offers a vivid illustration of the potential of the Belt and Road Initiative and the win-win cooperation the country advocates.  As the saying goes, ""Alone, we go faster; together, we go further."" The Yamal Arctic gas terminal takes the Belt and Road Initiative to the extreme north, where China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Russia and other countries for the joint exploration of Arctic resources in a responsible way.            "
Spiraling tensions highlight urgency of peaceful solution,12/6/2017,"                                             Less than a week after Pyongyang test-fired a new ballistic missile presumed capable of reaching the United States, and two days after the US and the Republic of Korea launched their biggest-ever joint air exercise, the fact that a senior United Nations official was in Pyongyang for discussions with a leading official of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea raises hopes that diplomacy can still defuse the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis. What Jeffrey Feltman, UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, and DPRK Vice-Foreign Minister Pak Myong Guk talked about on Wednesday remains unclear. But it is to be hoped that the UN envoy at least helped forestall a final showdown on the peninsula, even if he cannot talk total sense into the DPRK leadership. The odds on a full-scale war breaking out on the peninsula have never been higher, with the US warning the regime in Pyongyang will ""be utterly destroyed"", and the DPRK countering by saying that Washington is ""begging for nuclear war"". Any misjudgment or miscalculation threatens to turn this war of words into hostilities that would put the lives of millions of people in peril. That Jilin Daily, a local newspaper in China's Jilin province bordering the DPRK, published a full page of ""common sense"" advice on Wednesday informing people how to protect themselves from a nuclear explosion sparked speculation among Chinese netizens about how imminent war was. Although it should not be hyped up, the newspaper's move does shed some light on how sensitive the Korean Peninsula issue is. Despite Beijing's best efforts to persuade the DPRK to suspend its nuclear warhead and missile tests, and the US to suspend its military drills with the Republic of Korea, the two belligerents seem to be set on a head-on collision. The window to avoiding the worst-case scenario has not yet closed. There is still time for stakeholders to put aside their differences and work jointly so that reason will prevail. Wars may begin with an end in mind, but do not necessarily end how and when you please. An armistice has been in place for 64 years, surely it is time all the stakeholders sat down and thrashed out a permanent peace deal.           "
Trump reckless to play with a match on a powder keg,12/6/2017,"                                                 US President Donald Trump delivers remarks recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel at the White House in Washington, US December 6, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   If United States President Donald Trump's previous foreign policy moves have by and large been driven by putting ""America first"", his intention to formally recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move the US embassy there would be at best described as ill-advised, more accurately dangerously foolhardy if carried out. Whatever motivated his announcement, the potential consequences surely make it too costly to be put into action by anyone listening to reason.Of course, it may be intended to shift public attention at home, even temporarily, away from the investigation which has now snared his former security advisor Michael Flynn. It may be intended to please his supporters and backers. And, of course, the Israeli government applauds it. But what else?It will not advance US national interests. Nor will it further efforts to secure peace in the Middle East.President Trump has an understandable eagerness to accomplish something big. So after declaring past engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a ""failure"", his administration has reportedly concluded ""delaying the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has done nothing to achieve peace"", ignoring such recognition's potential to put an end to any prospect of that being attainable.Despite his proud confidence in himself as an exceptional dealmaker, and difference-maker, it is extremely dangerous for Trump to continue assuming knots of history are as simple to unravel as seems to believe. No country has its embassy in Jerusalem, for good reason. Admittedly, the idea of relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem was first proposed way before Trump began to play with it. The US Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act in 1995, requiring the relocation while pragmatically giving presidents the power to delay. It has been delayed all the way till today, and not on an idle whim. Past administrations demonstrated common prudence on the matter because of their shared awareness of the dire consequences that would result from doing otherwise. The long-standing US policy then has rightly been Jerusalem's final status must be decided through negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.Trump has received warnings of the dire consequences that will result from carrying out the relocation from around the world. If he chooses to disregard their wise counsel, he will not only be going back on his words to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas about his commitment to facilitating an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and his administration’s pursuit of an ""ultimate deal"", he will effectively upend that policy and open a Pandora's box of turmoil in the region that experience suggests will be felt worldwide.

How gas-for-coal program is carried out makes a difference,12/5/2017,"                                             The National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, has stepped in to coordinate the major natural gas suppliers to stabilize prices and ensure an adequate supply to cope with rising demand in northern China. That the supply of gas has been insufficient to meet the demand has resulted in many residents in North China's Hebei province not having the heating they need, which indicates local policymakers were too hasty in implementing their gas-for-coal energy policy. With the provincial development and reform commission issuing an orange alert for the short supply of natural gas, emergency measures were adopted to strictly restrict its supply to enterprises in order to guarantee that there has been enough for household heating. And with the demand exceeding supply, the price for natural gas, especially liquefied natural gas rocketed, which further exacerbated the already severe crisis. Had the local policymakers conducted thorough investigations in advance about the gap between the amount of natural gas that is needed for heating in winter and the amount that could be supplied, they would have been able to avert the crisis by drawing up detailed plans to implement the clean energy program in a phased manner. Some of the coal-burning boilers might also have been kept in operation to provide heating when necessary if there was an insufficient supply of gas. How a policy is carried out so it achieves its aims without unintended side effects requires not just hard work but also wisdom on the part of policymakers, who should put themselves in the shoes of residents. The central government's policy of substituting gas for coal as fuel for heating is imperative to improve the air quality, which, let us not forget, has been severe at times in the past. What has gone wrong in northern China is the way this laudatory policy has been implemented. There are lessons that can be learned from the experience in order to ensure that local authorities implement the central government's initiatives in the way they are intended so that they produce the designed benefits.               "
Australian leader should not pander to anti-China bias,12/5/2017,"                                                    Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia December 5, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    It is not inappropriate for Australia to ban foreign political donations. But it is inappropriate for Canberra to cite Beijing as the reason. When Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull explained his country's intention to crack down on external interference in domestic politics on Tuesday, he wrongly made China the scapegoat, by citing ""disturbing reports about Chinese influence"".     The reports Turnbull mentioned were by Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which have jointly been whipping up an anti-China backlash since June.  The two media outlets, presenting unsupported claims as facts and basing their reports on speculation, have accused China of trying to influence the Australian political system by prompting Australian businessmen of Chinese origin to make donations to the country's political parties.  Turnbull should not have bought into this media orchestrated falsehood. And it is wrong for him to engineer his country's policies based on the Australian media's bias against China. The unjustified finger-pointing at China only hurts Australia's ties with its biggest trading partner.  China has no reason to seek political influence in Australia. The growing bilateral ties, highlighted by strengthened economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, have remained the mainstream of interactions in recent years, benefiting both.  Admittedly, the two countries do have differences, not least in their political systems, but that should not create undue friction. Especially since the fundamentals of China-Australia ties remain sound and intact. The signing of China-Australia Free Trade Agreement two years ago created a new starting point for bilateral trade cooperation and has produced tangible benefits for both sides.  In recent years, more and more Australians have come to realize that China plays an indispensible role in propelling Australia's economy. Yet there remains an ugly stain on the generally rosy picture of ties, as there are some who claim the growing trade ties are creating dependency and who are trying to revive the idea of a China threat, which has already been shown to be a fallacy.  This year, this ill trend has become more prominent, as some media and politicians in Australia, instead of extinguishing the fire have chosen to fan the flames. If this tendency persists it could eventually undermine ties.  Substantive engagement at senior levels is needed to shore up the relationship by forging greater trust, instilling Australian leaders with the confidence to refute the unfounded accusations of anti-China proponents.                  "
Alarm bells ringing as US continues to up the stakes,12/4/2017,"                                             A week after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea tested its most sophisticated and powerful intercontinental ballistic missile to date, the United States and the Republic of Korea began joint air force exercises on the Korean Peninsula on Monday.  The drill reportedly involves some of the US' most advanced military hardware, including F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters, and perhaps B1-B bombers.  However, the power disparity in favor of the US and the ROK is unlikely to put a break on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.  After launching that widely condemned ICBM in defiance of United Nations sanctions, Pyongyang is now accusing the US and ROK of pushing ""the already acute situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of nuclear war"" and saying they will ""pay dearly for their provocations"".  With neither side indicating any willingness to give the ""dual suspension"" proposal, aimed at creating an environment conducive to talks, serious consideration, the brinksmanship between the US and the DPRK is set to continue, and escalate.  There is real danger in the game they are playing, as the bellicose posturing between the US and DPRK leaders is raising the stakes to the point where they are putting their own futures as leaders on the line. With both counting on the other to fold, that is high-stakes play that risks misjudgment and conflict, and puts regional stability in jeopardy.  As unappealing as it may appear to them as they grandstand for their respective audiences, the best bet for both would be declaring a willingness to negotiate.  The rest of the international community can help in this regard. The imperative task they share is to make sure everything spelt out in the UN Security Council resolutions is honestly implemented. They can lower the stakes by demonstrating unity and thereby sending the unmistakable message that UN sanctions will be carried out to the letter and be sustained.  For their part, the stakeholders should consult with one another, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. Unilateral actions, especially if they create discord among stakeholders, will only embolden the two principal players to up the ante even higher.  The message the leaders of the two countries keep sending one another is nuclear war is imminent and that is what the world keeps hearing and fearing.  Yet that nightmare scenario remains unlikely. More likely is the US keeps applying pressure in the hope the situation keeps deteriorating on the current track until the current regime in the DPRK collapses. This would produce a chain reaction of consequences that are both possible and probable, and really should be feared if the two main players continue to play their dangerous game.         "
Building a better world for all is China's mission,12/4/2017,"                      Bright prospects for the commons are what General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Communist Party of China Central Committee sought to convey in his keynote speech at the world political parties dialogue on Friday, in which he accentuated his proposal that countries work together to build a community of shared future for all mankind. Building such a community will remain an unrealistic prospect unless every country associates its own development with that of the world. Yet, despite two world wars and the Cold War, zero-sum thinking is still prevalent. As a result, the prosperity of some nations continues to be at the expense of the rest of the world. China and its ruling party are trying to blaze a new trail and are calling on countries to build a global community with a shared future that is inclusive of different countries, cultures and peoples. Such a community must accommodate all cultures. The principle of agreeing to disagree needs to be maintained in the exchanges between different countries and cultures. Only when all countries and cultures adopt an inclusive attitude toward other cultures will the world develop into a harmonious global community. The prerequisite and foundation for people to pursue better lives is peace. That explains why Xi called for the concerted efforts of all countries and political parties to build a world free from war and all kinds of terrorism. He proposes the building of a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable concept of security in order to maintain a just and fair security pattern that can provide the world with the key to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and maintain world peace. A community of shared future for all mankind must also realize common prosperity to allow the people of all countries and ethnicities to benefit from the world's economic development. The ever widening gap between the haves and have-nots that has resulted from unbalanced development needs to be changed, and economic development and social progress need to be made more inclusive and balanced.

Building a better world with foreign parties,12/2/2017,"                          Serving the Chinese people has always been the primary goal of the Communist Party of China, but it has also had a global vision, and the ongoing CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-level Meeting in Beijing is an example of giving shape to that vision.   As CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping said in his keynote speech at the meeting on Friday, the CPC is committed to striving for world peace and development, and the interactions among different countries and peoples will create favorable conditions for building a community of shared future for humankind. Themed ""Working together toward a community with a shared future for humanity and a better world: Responsibilities of political parties"", the meeting reflects the CPC's keenness to work for the common good of humankind. That the CPC has invited representatives of not only communist parties but also non-communist parties from more than 120 countries shows it wants to promote its unique development model to help other developing countries to solve their problems, as well as learn from their experiences and practices. Focusing on political parties' construction, practice and duties, the meeting offers an open platform for constructive dialogue on common issues to more than 600 representatives from nearly 300 parties and political organizations. The participants will also gain insights into the CPC's valuable experience in party and nation building, and the role of a strong party in a country's economic, social and political development. This coming together of so many parties has a special meaning in the CPC's history and for international relations. A party should always be ready to inflict ""self-revolution"" to maintain its honesty and efficiency; it must also achieve theoretical breakthroughs to help its members to adapt to the fast changing times and situations. This is precisely what the CPC has done by expediting reforms, strengthening the anti-corruption campaign and enriching the political theory. The three aspects are supplementary. The supply-side structural reform has made economic growth sustainable and more stable, the anti-graft drive is purifying the CPC, and ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"", enshrined in the Party's Constitution now, will help the people to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. The Beijing meeting will hopefully convey the CPC's confidence to the participants-especially to those from developing and less-developed countries-and prompt them to use their national conditions and people's real needs, rather than some Western models, to choose their reform and development path.

US move threatens free trade,12/2/2017,"                      The legal brief the United States filed with the World Trade Organization on Thursday to oppose the designation of China as a market economy risks derailing Sino-US economic relations and reflects Washington's unwillingness to respect free trade and globalization.  The US' move, as a third party in a case China has brought against the European Union, will help it impose anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese products, which could cause losses worth billions of dollars to Chinese enterprises.  On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty investigations into Chinese aluminum products without requests by US companies, which is rare.  Not happy with only raising the barriers to free trade, the US has now initiated a move to deny China market economy status so that it can continue using the surrogate country approach to evaluate the costs of imported Chinese products. As production cost is often much higher in a third country than in China, the US, when deciding the price of Chinese products in anti-dumping cases, will find it technically much easier to accuse China of dumping in the US market.  However, according to Article 15 of the Protocol on China's Accession to the WTO, which all WTO members including the US agreed, WTO members should have stopped using the surrogate country approach to investigate anti-dumping cases against China by Dec 11, 2016.  Perhaps the US is violating its own pledge in order to solve some of its economic problems, especially its colossal trade deficits. But it cannot do so by targeting Chinese products, because goods from other countries with low production costs will replace them.  Worse, the US move could jeopardize bilateral trade ties. Sino-US economic relations have progressed relatively well in recent years. The two sides have also established various economic dialogue mechanisms to bridge their differences, and exports of some US products, such as beef, to China have increased thanks to the trade-rebalancing 100-day action plan.  But if the US continues using its one-sided trade policies, it could derail the result-oriented bilateral economic relationship, which will serve neither side's interest.         "
US Commerce Department's move goes against fair trade,11/30/2017,"                                                    On Tuesday, the United States Department of Commerce abruptly initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty investigations into Chinese aluminum products, which may lead to punitive import duties.    The move, which for the first time since 1991 was instigated on the Commerce Department's own initiative rather than in response to a request by a US company, is unwarranted and counterproductive.   It erects barriers to normal bilateral trade and does a disservice to the two sides' ongoing efforts to reduce their trade imbalance. It also comes less than a month after US President Donald Trump wound up his maiden trip to Beijing with the signing of business deals worth $250 billion.   It is normal for the world's two largest economies to have trade frictions from time to time, and Beijing is doing its best to ease them. The 100-day action plan it proposed under the framework of the Sino-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington underscores its earnestness in trying to accommodate the US' concerns.  However, although the US agreed to the action plan, it seems Washington wants Beijing to make all the concessions, and it is unwilling to try and meet it halfway.  Instead, the US has gone in the opposite direction. Rather than opting for consultations or the dispute-resolution mechanisms of the World Trade Organization for what it claims are unfair practices regarding imports of alloy aluminum sheet from China, it has opted for unilateral action. This only hurts mutual trust and efforts to strengthen cooperation, and may trigger retaliation — a statement from the Ministry of Commerce said China was highly dissatisfied with the US move.  In the context of the big picture of Sino-US trade, the imports of Chinese aluminum sheets, the targeted products, are of little significance — imports of the Chinese products were valued at about $600 million last year. Yet the signal sent by Washington on the issue is more worrying, since it appears to be again leaning toward protectionism.   By launching probes into the Chinese imports without any requests from US companies and industries, Washington is going against the free, fair and reciprocal trade that it has so often proclaimed it wants to safeguard.  The interwoven economic interests of the US and China have been a firm foundation for what the US State Department described on Wednesday as a strong and constructive results-oriented relationship. Rather than making moves that threaten to derail it, the US should strive to keep relations on track and moving forward. Maintaining stable and healthy trade ties would enable the two sides to tap the huge potential of trade cooperation.                  "
Grave concerns that DPRK crisis is getting out of hand,11/30/2017,"                                              File photo provided by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Feb. 13, 2017 shows a test firing of a surface-to-surface medium- and long-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2 on Feb. 12, 2017. [Xinhua/KCNA]      Unilateral countermoves by individual stakeholders have proven insufficient, and ineffective, in reining in the nuclear weapons program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as its latest missile test on Wednesday demonstrated.   While the accumulative effect of Pyongyang's most recent series of tests has been a hardening of the consensus among the stakeholders that they should come to an end, there is still no well-coordinated collective response to achieve that aim.   The Republic of Korea responded to the latest DPRK missile test with a missile firing of its own within minutes, knowing full well it was a meaningless gesture.   After the launch, the DPRK's state news agency KCNA declared that Pyongyang had now achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, calling the weapons a defense against the ""nuclear blackmail policy"" of the United States. Although analysts suggest such missiles would be unable to hit the US carrying a nuclear warhead, the launch was enough for US President Donald Trump to issue one of his enigmatic statements - ""We will take care of it.""   Which is worrying. His recent unilateral move to tighten the screw of sanctions - by renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of terrorism - only served to accentuate the belief that his interest in diplomacy is simply for show.   Helpless as he is, ROK President Moon Jae-in is correct in observing the real danger is ""the situation could get out of control if North Korea perfects its ICBM technology"".   As a key stakeholder in the unfolding confrontation between Pyongyang and Washington, Beijing is in an awkward position, bearing the brunt of the blame for the failure to stop Pyongyang's nuclear missile program, even though that failure has essentially been everyone's, and being criticized for ""inaction"", which totally ignores the truth.   Beijing wants the two belligerents to calm down as much as anyone. It is vexed that a golden opportunity to build concerted momentum to encourage Pyongyang to engage in talks has been so casually wasted by the Trump administration's recent action of renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of state terrorism, which may have prompted Pyongyang's latest missile launch.   There is a severe trust deficit among the relevant parties that is being repeatedly exacerbated by the actions of Washington and Pyongyang. This, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, is moving the situation further away from the point where a settlement of the crisis can begin.   Which means the clock is ticking down to one of two choices: learning to live with the DPRK having nuclear weapons or triggering a tripwire to the worst-case scenario. But there is a third choice, which the US keeps ignoring. That is for all stakeholders to genuinely pull together to put an end to Pyongyang's dangerous game once and for all through dialogue and a peace treaty.   To achieve this, as Beijing has consistently argued, requires accommodating the concerns of the various parties and following the proposed step-by-step plan to establish the conditions necessary for dialogue.

'Tiger' hunt shows Party is resolved to clean house,11/28/2017,"                                                    Barely two days after the Communist Party of China's top disciplinary body announced the investigation of Lu Wei, former deputy chief of the Party's Publicity Department, Zhang Yang, a former member of the Central Military Commission, who was also under investigation, committed suicide on Thursday.     Lu, the first high-level official, or ""tiger"", brought down by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection after the Party's 19th National Congress, is under investigation for what are described as serious violations of disciplinary protocols.  Zhang was being investigated for his connections with the disgraced former CMC vice-chairmen Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, as well as offering and accepting bribes and holding a huge amount of assets whose origin was unclear, in addition to other discipline violations.  The investigations of Lu, who was also head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, and Zhang, who was also the former head of the military's Political Work Department, have come as timely reassurance that the graft-busters are not easing up on their endeavors and, as CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping has vowed, there are no no-go zones.  With the central leadership's demonstrated resolve to make the fight against corruption never ending and a lasting political legacy, it is evident that the graft-busters are determined to leave no stone unturned.  But while pursuing those who seek to escape with impunity for their wrongdoings, it is important at the same time to mend the loose or broken fences that have allowed corruption to breed and spread in the manner it has.  The CPC has made impressive progress in this regard by installing new anti-graft protocols and institutionalizing proven remedies, especially over the past five years. More will be achieved as the anti-graft efforts become more systematic.  A comprehensive review of existing corruption-prevention mechanisms and their subsequent overhaul, such as the establishment of a national supervisory commission system, and the adoption of national anti-corruption legislation, are indispensable for that to happen.  As Xi said in his speech at the 19th CPC National Congress, it takes good blacksmith to make good steel. The efforts to establish the clean, honest, upright working style Xi envisions, and which people are longing for, have to go hand in hand with efforts to rid the People's Liberation Army of the pernicious influence of corruption in order to make it fit for purpose.  Only through strengthening deterrence, creating a cage of institutions, and maintaining constant vigilance against corruption will the military be ready to meet the demands of the day and the political environment be clean and free of corruption.                   "
Beijing's positive response encouraging,11/28/2017,"                              A firefighter checks the site on Sunday of the Nov 18 fire that killed 19 people and injured eight others in Xinjian village, Beijing's Daxing district. [Zou Hong/China Daily]      Beijing Party chief Cai Qi said at a meeting on Monday that consideration must be shown to those people who experience difficulties as a result of the campaign to check safety hazards in places where many migrant workers are living. As well as being people-oriented, the work must not be done in haste, he said.  The campaign was launched after a fire, reportedly caused by faulty electrical wiring, claimed the lives of 19 people in Beijing's suburban Daxing district on Nov 18.        There can be no doubt such a campaign is necessary, but what has been done in some areas has sparked a public outcry because the swiftness with which people were asked to leave their homes in buildings deemed a risk seemed harsh.  What Cai said at the meeting will be reassuring as it is a positive response to the criticism of the campaign by someone who was himself an influential opinion leader on social media and knows the importance of keeping the public properly informed.  A lot of problems and difficulties will have been encountered by the law enforcers no matter how well planned the safety campaign has been, as some of those who needed to be evacuated from dwellings with safety hazards will have been reluctant to be moved.  The authorities should have given the residents more time to relocate, as Cai said, and the inspection should have been carried out in a more orderly way.  Of course, it will be impossible for the campaign to be carried out to the satisfaction of all those having to vacate the premises where the live, even though it is for their own safety. But if enough is done to help those who find themselves in difficulties as a result, whether by providing temporary accommodation or train tickets home, there is no reason why this indispensible campaign cannot proceed smoothly with the public's blessing.  It is hoped that Cai's words will help ensure law-based governance and put an end to all the controversy.         "
Rules governing soccer ban political provocations,11/28/2017,"                      The Chinese Football Association announced on Sunday that the nation's Under-20 team will return home from Germany after indefinitely suspending the plan for the team to play a series of friendlies with German fourth division teams after Tibetan ""independence flags"" were unfurled at a match in Mainz.  The team only agreed to continue playing in the televised match against TSV Schott Mainz after the protesters took down the flags.  While it might be argued that it would have been hard to prevent the flags entering the stadium, that does not excuse the German Football Association, which organized the matches, of its response.  Ronny Zimmermann, vice-president of the German FA, said it could not ban the protests, as the protesters had the right to freedom of expression and ""certain rules apply"".  Indeed, FIFA's code of conducts for stadiums contains an article that prohibits political slogans and banners from being displayed.  It is natural therefore that the Chinese soccer players and Chinese FA feel indignant. What the pro-Tibetan ""independence"" activists did obviously violated FIFA rules and went against the sporting spirit.  Under FIFA rules it is the obligation of the German host organization to guarantee that such matches are free from political protests. If such a requirement cannot be met, there is enough reason for the Chinese side to withdraw from the matches that had been arranged.  It is quite probable that many Germans consider the incident to be a storm in a teacup, and regard the decision by the Chinese FA to be an overreaction.  Yet China's commitment to national unity is well known, and they would understand why its Under-20 team and its FA have acted as they did, and why the incident is so politically sensitive, if they were willing to put themselves in the shoes of their Chinese counterparts.  There is no doubt that the majority of Western countries use double standards when it comes to the question of Tibet. Look at how the majority of Western countries reacted to Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain, and how they accommodate the Dalai Lama's activities worldwide in his quest for the so-called independence of Tibet.  The situation, as the Chinese FA has said, is regrettable because the incident has put a dent in the well-established friendly relations between the two countries.  It is hoped that the repercussions of this particular incident will help countries understand China's position, and that its resolve not to tolerate any separatist sentiment will sink in. If so, cooperation will be able to continue smoothly.         "
Transient workers deserve respect,11/26/2017,"                       A photo that went viral on social media platforms, captioned as homeless migrant workers sleeping outdoors on a roadside in the freezing cold of Beijing, which coincides with the city's 40-day crackdown on rental homes that are potential fire hazards, has been identified as one from the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.  Despite the photo being misused, there have been concerns raised about the campaign since tenants of rental homes found to be ""unsafe"" in Beijing's ongoing safety checks are being forced to leave en masse. But the city-wide campaign is not driven by a government agenda to get rid of the ""low-end population"" as some are suggesting, the municipal authorities have stressed.   They did not use, or even invent that term. Nobody wants to take credit for that. But despite that, the discriminative, derogatory term is often heard off the record and it hardly raises an eyebrow in present-day Beijing.   It is a harsh truth, but low-income, non-local residents, mostly transient workers from rural areas, seldom get the treatment they deserve for making our cities better places to live. Instead, they are more often viewed as a dispensable, even unwelcome group by many.  And that the renters of residences in the capital suddenly found unsafe, even ""illicit"", are being evicted on very short notice, a week maximum, amid the hostile winter winds blowing through the capital may indeed sound harsh. To them, at least for now, Beijing is not as local authorities claim – ""the best place to be"".   But the municipal authorities in Beijing have reason to feel wronged.   This is a well-intentioned campaign gone awry. Well not awry, rather from their perspective it is being misread.  The November 18 fire in Daxing District, which claimed 19 lives, was a reminder of the deadly potential unsafe rental homes pose, to which the authorities have responded quickly with sweeping checks.   They admit some of campaign might have been carried out too hastily, but they are already taking steps to rectify this.  Portraying what is a necessary safety campaign as expelling those who are unwanted is thus irresponsible and groundless, as the authorities say.          "

Child abuse in kindergartens calls for tighter management,11/26/2017,"                      Any member of staff at Beijing's RYB kindergarten, if proved by a police investigation to be involved in child abuse, should be shown no leniency in terms of legal penalties. And RYB Education, a New York listed company, to which the kindergarten is affiliated, should also receive deserved punishment for its lack of proper management.   This is not the first incident of its kind. There have been similar reports concerning other kindergartens in recent years. Neither is it the first one involving a kindergarten of RYB Education. Four teachers at an RYB kindergarten in Siping, Northeast China's Jilin province, received prison sentences for jabbing 17 children with needles last year.   True, a lack of qualified teachers has long been a headache for kindergartens, whose number has been increasing rapidly. The development of preschool education in the country still lags far behind the boom in demand. It is thus natural for some kindergartens to recruit teachers who have never received the training required for the job.   Yet, it is still unimaginably horrendous that some kindergarten teachers should force the children in their care to ingest pharmaceutical drugs they are not supposed to eat, give them injections for untold purposes, and physically and psychologically abuse the youngsters.   It is not a matter of simply teachers being qualified or unqualified. It is matter of them having not a smattering of professional ethics and having lowered themselves below the standards of being a decent person with their actions.  How can a kindergarten recruit such teachers? Does a kindergarten have rules for teachers to abide by when it comes to how they should treat the children placed in their care? It is imperative that kindergartens employ those who have been trained for the work.  It is never enough to just punish the teachers once a child abuse case occurs in a kindergarten. Neither is it justifiable to cite the lack of qualified teachers as an excuse for the poor and sloppy management on the part of both kindergartens and the education authority of a local government.   Strict requirements must be in place that both public and private kindergartens have to abide by when it comes to the qualification of teachers, as well as other aspects of kindergarten care.   The investigation into the RYB kindergarten scandal is still going on. It is hoped that the publication of the results will give the lie to the rumors rampant on the internet about the scandal. It is also hoped that the supervision and management of kindergartens will be effectively tightened nationwide for children to get the care they deserve.          "
"China's solution to Rakhine crisis practical, constructive",11/24/2017,"                              Myanmar's State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi and visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meet for talks in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, November 19. 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Will finger-pointing and the threat of sanctions help solve the crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine state? Definitely not. Casting accusations at a sovereign government for how it has been handling its domestic affairs is not constructive in helping to navigate what is a complex issue anywhere near to a final settlement.  It is anything but sober-minded to point an accusing finger at any particular party. Whatever the root causes and immediate spark for the crisis, efforts are needed to get the parties involved to the negotiation table. It is important for all involved to realize that nothing could be more conducive to ethnic reconciliation and the well-being of the whole nation than the stability necessary for development in the region.  Being a neighbor and long-time friend, China has proposed a three-step way to resolve the crisis.  The first step is securing a ceasefire and restoring order, which is the precondition for the parties involved to engage in talks.  The second is working out feasible ways to solve the issue through consultations and implement as soon as possible the memorandum of understanding on repatriation signed by Myanmar and Bangladesh on Thursday. These address the current symptoms of the crisis.  The third step, which is development, aims to bring the crisis to a final settlement once and for all.  This is because, aside from historical reasons, poverty is the source of the conflicts between the ethnic groups in the north of the country. If the local economy remains underdeveloped and people there continue to live a hand-to-mouth existence, it will be impossible for reconciliation to be permanent.  China is the last to want its next-door neighbor to be in chaos. And it will do whatever it can to extend a helping hand.  What Myanmar and its people need most are peace, stability and development.  To these ends, Li Zuocheng, the chief of the Joint Staff Department of China's Central Military Commission, speaking with visiting Myanmar Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday, said China is willing to maintain communication with the Myanmar military to promote peace and stability along the border and is willing to help its neighbor seize the opportunities offered by its development.  China believes that regional stability, with its neighbors in particular, can be better guaranteed by economic growth and social progress, and it has proposed a Y-shaped China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that would advance balanced development across Myanmar, a country that the UN listed as one of the least developed in a report it released on Thursday.  By working with China to build this economic corridor, Myanmar can actively facilitate its domestic development.  The international community should play its part by helping to create the necessary conditions to find a settlement to the current crisis.         "
Co-location arrangement consolidates HK's status,11/23/2017,"                             A view of the West Kowloon Cultural District, Hong Kong, which is under construction, from Victoria Peak on April 30, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    Since the central government is advancing coordinated development of the Pearl River Delta with the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions with the aim of it becoming the world's leading bay area by GDP, few doubt the importance of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) in helping Hong Kong consolidate its status as a key global financial, shipping and trading center, and enhancing its overall competitiveness.  Not only is the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail link a crucial element in the bid for a ""one-hour travel zone"" encompassing all the major cities around the Pearl River Delta. It is also significant as it will connect Hong Kong with the mainland's high-speed railway network, which in turn is envisioned as being part of a high-speed rail network that extends throughout the region and beyond, as part of the country's Belt and Road Initiative.  Thus the cooperation agreement signed on Saturday between the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments on the proposed co-location arrangement for boundary control at the West Kowloon terminus of the XRL is an important step for the closer integration of the Greater Bay Area. It is also essential for ensuring the future prosperity of Hong Kong. The agreement formally commences the three-step process to implement the arrangement that will allow officers from both sides to complete exit and entry clearance procedures for cross-boundary passengers at the same location.  This is an essential requirement if the Hong Kong section of the nation's high-speed rail network is to realize its full economic benefits and make the mega infrastructure facility worth the HK$84.4 billion (US$10.8 billion) that was invested in it.  It is widely expected that the co-location plan will complete the remaining two steps-securing the endorsement of the National People's Congress Standing Committee and completing the local legislative process in Hong Kong-in time for the commissioning of the Hong Kong section of the XRL in the third quarter of 2018.  High speed is the XRL's defining feature, and convenient cross-boundary customs, immigration and quarantine procedures are instrumental to realizing this effectively. There are already successful overseas examples of the co-location of CIQ facilities of two jurisdictions, including the arrangement between the United States and Canada, and the one between the United Kingdom and France.  There is no practical or feasible alternative to completing the co-location arrangement at the West Kowloon terminus.  Without boundary control at the West Kowloon terminus, the direct economic benefits, estimated by some experts to reach HK$260 billion, would be greatly discounted.  The three-step process, when completed, will therefore fulfill all the legal requirements for what is an absolute imperative.         "
US wrong to resort to long-arm jurisdiction,11/23/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters, targeting DPRK, Iran in his 1st UN speech in New York, US, Sept 19, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      The United States on Tuesday slapped fresh sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and three Chinese companies were blacklisted as part of what US Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin called the US' ""maximum pressure campaign"" to isolate Pyongyang.  China keeps getting caught in the crosshairs of this campaign. This is the third time this year that Chinese companies and individuals have fallen victim to US sanctions against the DPRK.  Heather Nauert, a US State Department spokeswoman, said she did not think targeting more Chinese companies would affect Beijing's cooperation on the DPRK issue-""We have a good relationship with China. That's not going to change.""  However, as China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, resorting to long-arm jurisdiction based on its own domestic laws and regulations is the wrong method for forging effective cooperation.  China aims to strictly implement the UN Security Council resolutions, and the US should share any intelligence it might have of Chinese individuals or companies violating them so that China can investigate for itself any contravention of its international obligations.  Talking is the right way to guarantee a good relationship. And, as Beijing has repeatedly said, Washington and Pyongyang need to start talking if lasting stability is to be secured.  Washington may feel the need to continuously increase its pressure on Pyongyang given the latter's repeated missile and nuclear weapons testing, not least to demonstrate to the US public it is doing something, especially because the sanctions imposed by the UN will take time to have the desired effect. But while doubling up on first its military threats and now its sanctions, Washington should keep in mind its aim should be getting Pyongyang to talk.  It should also bear in mind that Beijing and Washington are in the same boat, and that good momentum has been achieved recently.  In the latest developments, bilateral ties between China and the Republic of Korea have improved rapidly since they decided to properly handle their differences over the deployment of a US antimissile system in the ROK. The ROK's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha is on an official visit to Beijing this week.  While on Tuesday, the Kremlin announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had exchanged views on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue with US President Donald Trump in a phone conversation.  These are just the latest efforts in the intensive diplomacy that the various stakeholders are engaged in. Diplomacy that should drive home the message they share the political will to secure a peaceful and lasting resolution to the issue. All the stakeholders need to continue to walk in same direction, as they have seemed to be doing recently.  With the DPRK's ruling party also expressing the wish to strengthen inter-party exchanges with China, which suggests it wants to keep the door open, now is not the time for the US to step back from cooperation.

US' ill-judged move dims prospects for DPRK talks,11/22/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters, targeting DPRK, Iran in his 1st UN speech in New York, US, Sept 19, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Despite his war of words with the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump expressed his preference for a diplomatic solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis during his recent trip to Asia.  Yet in a move that seems to go directly against this professed intention, Trump put the DPRK back on the United States' terrorism blacklist on Monday.  The designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism will only further alienate the country. It makes the prospects for talks much dimmer, and may even eliminate the possibility of any talks.  The move comes at a time when the Korean Peninsula had become calmer. For more than two months, Pyongyang has refrained from conducting any missile and nuclear tests.  The US' designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism could lay waste to the efforts of China and Russia to bring the DPRK back to the negotiation table. Instead, it could be used by Pyongyang as a pretext to renew its weapons tests, thus restarting the vicious circle of escalating tensions on the peninsula that had seemed in danger of spiraling out of control.  Besides whether the DPRK meets the legal requirements for being relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism is questionable, even at the US State Department. Trump has based the designation on the alleged killing of Kim's half brother Kim Jong-nam by DPRK agents at Kuala Lumpur airport in February. But even if this proves to be the case, lawyers say there has to be more than one terrorist incident to substantiate the claim.  The designation seems more like an excuse for the US to seek the highest level of sanctions against Pyongyang as part of its proclaimed ""maximum pressure campaign"".  But the DPRK has already been under crushing sanctions imposed by the United Nations and other countries, which restrict its oil imports and ban most of its exports, aimed at depriving it of funds for its nuclear and missile programs. It takes time for such sanctions to bite, there is no evidence that further sanctions will achieve more immediate results in constraining Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Even US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson admitted the designation is a ""very symbolic move"" and their ""practical effects may be limited"".  The DPRK has justified its pursuit of nuclear weapons with its existential concerns, insisting the weapons will help it better defend itself from the threat of a US invasion. The latest US move only serves to fan that fear-given what happened to Iraq and Libya-and does a disservice to easing the already tense situation on the peninsula. Instead, as China said on Tuesday, ""more should be done"" to resolve the crisis through dialogue.         "
China-ROK trust provides boost for regional stability,11/21/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping (R) meets with Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in in Da Nang, Vietnam, Nov 11, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea Kang Kyung-wha is scheduled to visit Beijing on Tuesday to hold bilateral talks with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Reports by the ROK media say Kang's trip is to prepare for an upcoming summit between the leaders of the two countries.  Kang's visit underscores the two neighbors' earnestness in wanting to fully restore bilateral ties at an early date.  Relations soured after the previous ROK administration decided to deploy the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK. But the two sides announced they would bring bilateral relations back onto their normal track at the end of last month.  This came after Kang told ROK lawmakers that Seoul would not seek additional THAAD deployment and there has been no change in Seoul's stance that it will not participate in the US-led missile defense system. Since then, Beijing and Seoul have sought to rebuild momentum in their bilateral interactions.  President Xi Jinping met his ROK counterpart Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting earlier this month in Da Nang, Vietnam. A visit by Moon to Beijing next month would signal good relations are well on the way to being fully restored.  The current thaw in bilateral ties would not have happened had the ROK not realized the necessity of adjusting its policy on THAAD.  Moon has adopted a different approach to his predecessor. As his adviser said on Monday, Moon is seeking to build trust with China, Russia and Mongolia through economic cooperation and hopes to eventually expand the cooperation to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The strong political resolve and matching actions it has displayed to resolve the THAAD issue have paved the way for China and the ROK to restore trust. It is to be hoped Seoul will honor the commitments it has made.  Mending the fences of bilateral ties epitomizes the political wisdom of the two neighbors. It not only serves their own interests but also caters to the efforts to break the tensions arising from the antagonism between the US and the DPRK.  The situation has been threatening to spin out of control with the rhetoric of Washington and Pyongyang becoming increasingly aggressive. The shared determination of both sides to defuse the crisis without resorting to military options will surely help prevent that nightmare scenario from occurring.  China and the ROK have common interests in pursuing regional peace and stability. Something Xi rightly pointed out during his meeting with Moon in Vietnam.  And the public in the ROK is clearly appreciative of Moon's change of approach. His approval rating has climbed to over 70 percent in recent weeks.  The renewed rapport between Beijing and Seoul ties will help build on fruitful communication among stakeholders in the Korean Peninsula issue of late. This in turn can help create conditions conducive to resolving the issue through dialogue.         "
Right time for region to build economic community,11/14/2017,"                                             This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and China's relationship with the 10-member bloc is the most vibrant among the bloc's relations with its regional partners, not least because they share a similar view of the importance of interconnectivity, interdependence and cooperation.  In his meeting with ASEAN leaders on Monday, Premier Li Keqiang reiterated China's commitment to being ASEAN's good friend and good neighbor while urging them to work with China to build a community of shared future in the region based on congruous ideals and responsibilities.   Relations between ASEAN and China have withstood the tests of time and the recent meetings show they will continue to do so. To promote the development of ties in the coming years, Li proposed the formulation of a vision for the strategic partnership toward the year 2030 that would build on the existing good momentum in their political-security, economic and socio-cultural cooperation.  And with ASEAN agreeing to begin negotiations with China on a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, relations stand at a promising new starting point.   The bloc has already vowed to build an ASEAN Economic Community and launched its Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, and these can be aligned with China's Belt and Road development strategy to promote common prosperity.  The series of meetings taking place in the Philippines between the leaders of ASEAN and its regional partners, including China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, have sent a strong message that countries in the region are now ready and willing to deepen their cooperation.   Which is why, speaking at the ASEAN, China, Japan and Republic of Korea leaders' meeting on Tuesday, Li encouraged the ""10 + 3"", as they are known, to make concerted efforts to further advance regional integration and development by establishing an East Asia Economic Community.   As Li rightly pointed out, East Asia has weathered the storm of two financial crises and is now one of the world's most dynamic and promising regions in terms of development. It accounted for 44 percent of the world's economic growth last year. Given this, coordinated efforts from the countries in the region to establish an economic community would better fulfill the common aspirations of people in the region.  Enhancing the complementarity of development strategies and expanding practical cooperation to establish an East Asia Economic Community would not only generate shared economic benefits but also foster more mutual trust and respect.  By supporting each other in their pursuit of economic and social development, countries in the region can demonstrate they are not only good partners but also good neighbors, and in doing so forge a vibrant community with a shared future that can be a model for the world.

China and ASEAN can safeguard stability in South China Sea,11/14/2017,"                              A joint maritime search and rescue exercise is held by China and ASEAN member states in Zhanjiang on Oct 31. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]    Developments over the past few days reveal the broadening consensus among the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China that they, and they alone, are ones who should get their maritime house in order, and they are fully capable of doing so.    Just hours after US President Donald Trump recommended himself to his Vietnamese host as ""a very good mediator and arbitrator"" for the South China Sea disputes, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and his Vietnamese counterpart reached a consensus on appropriately managing the two neighbors' maritime disputes.  And Premier Li Keqiang announced on Monday that China and the members of ASEAN will officially start negotiations on their planned Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. Agreement on this would provide a means of securing a peaceful external environment for the development of all countries in the neighborhood.  As Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte stated in his characteristic forthright manner on Sunday, the members of ASEAN and China ""have to be friends"" despite the attempts of ""other hotheads"" that want to provoke trouble.  The South China Sea disputes, which involve China and some ASEAN members, have existed for decades, but approached boiling point last year because of the instigations by some countries outside the region, particularly the United States and Japan, to create divisions within the bloc and with China.  Their scaremongering about an expansionist, aggressive China flexing its military muscles and seeking to ""control"" the vital waterway provoked unfounded fears that this was indeed the case.  The calm that has prevailed is the result of Beijing's painstaking endeavors to explain its intentions and reassure its neighbors that it does not seek to restrict free passage in the busy waterway or pursue development at their expense, but rather seeks to expand the convergence of interests with them and promote greater cooperation for the benefit of all.  That Xi, as president of China, is paying state visits to Vietnam and Laos besides attending the APEC forum, and Premier Li Keqiang is paying a formal visit to the Philippines after attending the ASEAN summit, are unmistakable signs of the importance China places on good neighborly relations, and the commitment the country is making to its established principles of amity and sincerity in its relations with its neighbors.  As Duterte said, no one in the region wants war and can ill-afford any violent confrontation. To ensure such a disastrous scenario does not materialize, the improvement in the situation should not be taken for granted, and all parties should work together to avoid any miscalculation that might resurrect tensions.

APEC leaders must now add substance to vision for growth,11/13/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping (5th L, front) poses for a group photo with other leaders and representatives from APEC member economies at the 25th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, Nov 11, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    Despite the lackluster global economic recovery, the Asia-Pacific has remained the world's most economically dynamic region and the main engine of global growth.    However, the world is undergoing major developments, transformation and adjustment, and the Asia-Pacific is no exception. It too faces challenges and destabilizing factors, as well as opportunities.  That is why Saturday's pledge by the leaders of the 21 economies in the Asia-Pacific to promote innovative and inclusive growth and jointly foster a shared future for the region is both welcome and uplifting.  The shared statement they delivered after their meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, builds confidence they recognize, as President Xi Jinping said in his speech at the opening session, that the APEC economies have a stake in each other's success and need to develop a stronger sense of community,  That Xi has attended the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting for five consecutive years demonstrates the importance China attaches to the APEC framework and the contribution it is making to foster a spirit of harmony and practical cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.  In his speech, Xi promised all parties will be better able to share the opportunities of China's development as it continues to open up, and he called on the APEC economies to enrich their partnerships and join hands to boost interconnected development and achieve common prosperity.  While those countries still pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in the wake of the withdrawal by the United States said they had made progress on a new agreement at the meeting, Xi again focused on the bigger picture and a more inclusive vision, saying the APEC economies should ""take determined steps toward a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific in line with the agreed road map"".  Pursuing shared, open, innovative, sustained and coordinated development would also foster new comprehensive and cooperative thinking on common challenges and security threats, and help foster the community spirit that would ensure stability and peace in the region. So it is to be hoped the region's leaders will be able to galvanize efforts to comprehensively and systematically advance the all-encompassing regional trade deal as they agreed.  In a series of separate meetings on the sidelines with the leaders of some of China's neighbors, Xi sought to build bridges and urged them to make constructive efforts to work with China to resolve their differences and establish healthy and stable ties.  The future of the region will be shaped by the choices made now. To ensure a bright future for all, the Asia-Pacific economies need to deliver on their optimism that they can set a strategic, aspirational and action-oriented vision for the future, by respecting each other, working together for an open and inclusive regional economy, and resolutely committing to settle their disputes and resolve their differences through dialogue.

Sino-US relations stand at historic new starting point,11/9/2017,"                             President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, and US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, pose for a photo in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony during their visit to the Palace Museum, or the Forbidden City, in Beijing on Wednesday. LAN HONGGUANG / XINHUA    From the Chinese and US first couples' meticulously arranged and memorable private visit to the Forbidden City to the $250 billion business deals announced on Thursday, Donald Trump's maiden trip to China as US president has indeed been a ""state visit plus"".     There was no reason for it not to be.  Although the differences that had been pestering bilateral ties have not instantly disappeared, the most important takeaway from their talks in Beijing has been the constructive approach to these issues the two leaders demonstrated.  Both expressed their willingness to work with, instead of against, the other in dealing with the differences between their two countries, in particular over trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear program.  Beijing and Washington have been working hard to find convergences on these two prominent issues, in particular, and will very likely work harder given the two leaders' agreement that cooperation between the two countries is the ""only correct choice"".  But these matters are complicated and they are unlikely to have come up with any quick fixes. Although both clearly believe the issues are solvable, with Trump saying they will work together to solve not only their mutual problems but also world ""problems of great danger and security"", and President Xi Jinping saying China is committed to working with the United States on issues of international concern, as well as controlling the differences between the two sides.  Such precious progress in trying to find common ground, along with the Chinese commitment to establish a constructive ""new-type of relationship"" with the US, as Xi again elaborated in his talks with Trump, will go a long way to anchoring the all-important, yet sometimes volatile, Sino-US relationship.  The concordant note struck by Xi and Trump showcased not only the personal rapport they have established, but also consolidated optimism about the prospects for bilateral ties, especially since Xi has previously emphasized the ""leading role of head-of-state diplomacy"", and Trump on Thursday touted the ""chemistry"" between himself and his host.  There is undoubtedly a lot of work left to do, as the US secretary of state pointed out. But the readiness of the two leaders to listen, as well as talk, was apparent in their public appearances, and offers hope that together, China and the US can do ""tremendous things"" to the benefit of both countries, even the world, as Trump suggested.  Certainly, China is willing since, as Xi said, the Pacific is big enough to accommodate both and although there are challenges the two nations need to face, these are limited, and there is boundless potential for growth.                  "
Personal rapport can guide ties in new era,11/8/2017,"                                             That China and the United States do not see eye-to-eye on every issue is something that is often in the public eye, given that the sticking points that are holding back Sino-US relations, such as trade frictions, the right way to approach the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea issue, are frequently pushed to the fore.   But these are not the totality of their relations, and they do not need to define their relationship, as wisdom and foresight can narrow the divergences between the two sides.   And it is wisdom and foresight that the leaders of the two countries are expected to show by providing strategic guidance for the development of relations during US President Donald Trump's three-day visit to China, which began on Wednesday.  The interwoven interests of the world's two largest economies, which are also one another's largest trading partner, have paved the way for growing cooperation. US and Chinese companies signed 19 deals worth $9 billion on Wednesday, with bigger deals expected to be inked at a ceremony attended by President Xi Jinping and Trump on Thursday.  And they have worked hard to address specific differences on diplomatic and security issues, trade and the economy, social and people-to-people issues, and law enforcement and cyber security in the first round of high-level strategic dialogues agreed at the Mar-a-Lago meeting between Xi and Trump in Florida in April.  Equally important has been the personal rapport that the two leaders have established, with Trump expressing his appreciation of the welcome arranged for him when he arrived in Beijing, saying he was having a ""great time"".   His visit is being described as a ""state visit plus"" because of the special arrangements that have been made for the two heads of state to interact informally. And given personal bonds play an important role in forging trust in foreign relations, there is ample reason to believe there will be tangible outcomes from their conversations.   That their discussions in April proved fruitful has led to expectations that by enhancing their personal bonds progress will be made on what Vice-Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said are ""significant issues of common concern"".   Certainly, by reaching new consensuses, they can inject fresh impetus into the development of China-US relations for the new era, which will benefit the peoples of both countries, and realize the hopes of the international community that they can better work together for the common good.

US and DPRK should come to the table to resolve crisis,11/7/2017,"                                             Trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been two constants in the tweets of the US president since he took office, so following his fractious exchanges with Kim Jong-un ahead of his first official visit to Northeast Asia, it comes as no surprise that the Korean crisis and trade have been the focus of his talks so far.   It was the case in Japan and the Republic of Korea. And it will very likely be the case in China, which is next on his itinerary.  After his war rhetoric of recent weeks, Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory and optimistic note on Tuesday in the ROK, expressing his strongest inclination yet that he was willing to deal with rising tensions with the DPRK through diplomacy, urging Pyongyang to ""come to the table"" and ""make a deal"".  But, once again, he also emphasized the military firepower the US can bring to bear.   Even from the perspective of crisis prevention, Trump should be availing himself of the opportunities presented by his visits to the three countries, and his anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to maneuver a consensus on how to deliver on the progress he says he sees. After all, as some US lawmakers noted on Saturday, ""there are no good military options"".  Beijing has repeatedly encouraged the United States and the DPRK to carry out direct dialogue as this is the only way to increase their understanding of each other's positions.   Pyongyang should take Trump's offer seriously. Ignoring this diplomatic olive branch, it may miss a historic opportunity for improving ties with Washington.  The restraint both Washington and Pyongyang have demonstrated so far — Trump steering clear of the Demilitarized Zone and Pyongyang not carrying out a missile or nuclear test for the longest period in recent months — is a hopeful sign that both prefer to find a peaceful solution to their predicaments.   Beijing has made relentless efforts to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means, and it will continue to play a constructive role by promoting tangible moves to bring the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue back to the track of political settlement at an early date.  While Trump did not elaborate on what he meant when telling US and ROK military commanders on Tuesday, ""Ultimately it will all work out, it always works out, it has to work out.""  We just hope he was speaking on the same wavelength as ROK President Moon Jae-in, who said he hoped Trump's visit would be a turning point in the crisis and that the two leaders had agreed to resolve the DPRK nuclear issue ""in peaceful manner"" that would ""bring permanent peace"".         "
Cooperation would benefit US more than blame game,11/7/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump speaks to the media before boarding Marine One departing the White House for Joint Base Andrews, in Washington DC, the United States, on Nov 3, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    US President Donald Trump once again harped on his favorite bête noire, trade deficits, during his visit to Japan on Sunday, the first stop on his five-country Asia tour, saying his country had ""suffered massive trade deficits at the hands of Japan for many, many years"".    Trump is expected to play the same card when he visits Beijing after his stop in South Korea this week, as he called the United States' trade deficit with China ""embarrassing"" and ""horrible"" ahead of his trip.  His criticism of the country's major trade partners in Asia may win him support back home from those who believe his claim that unfair trade practices have stripped jobs and wealth from the US-""decade after decade, trade deficit upon trade deficit"", as he said in March.  But his argument that the US is a loser in global trade simply because of the massive trade deficits it has incurred each year is misleading and fails to reflect the real benefits the country has gained from the existing global trade and economic regime.  In past decades, due to rising labor and environmental costs at home, the US moved much of its manufacturing production capacity overseas, retaining mainly its high-tech industries. It then imported low-priced manufacturing goods from other countries, which helped drive down its domestic inflation and benefited those US multinationals making the goods abroad, creating a windfall for US investors and consumers.  The US president habitually attributes the country's manufacturing job losses to ""unfair trade"". But according to the US' own data, its jobless rate dropped from 9.6 percent in 2010 to 4.9 percent in 2016, while its trade of goods deficit surged from less than $700 billion to $796.7 billion over the same period, indicating that a rise in its trade deficit is not accompanied by a loss of jobs.  Whether a country registers a trade surplus or deficit is largely decided by its role in the global division of labor and its development stage.  Trump's lambasting of the US' trade partners and his vows that under his administration the theft of American prosperity will end play well with the crowd-they carried him on a wave of popular sentiment into the White House after all-and no doubt they will serve to distract attention from his troubles at home, but they do nothing to help revitalize the US economy, unless he can gain a few favors from other leaders, or boost the global economy.  Instead of criticizing his hosts, Trump should seek to promote cooperation to advance ""free and reciprocal"" trade to the benefit of both the region and the world.               "
China champions open trade with import expo,11/5/2017,"                                             In a move to implement the country's pledge to expand economic opening-up to benefit the global trade system, the first China International Import Expo is to be held in Shanghai in November next year.  The expo is an important action by the Chinese government to further open up the domestic market and optimize the country's trade structure with the rest of the world. It is not only in line with China's own development needs but also the development needs of the world.  China is now the world's second-largest economy, its largest exporter and second-largest importer, and since its development has shifted from quantity to quality, it has a growing demand for high-quality commodities and services. By helping expand the Chinese market the expo will enable countries to get on the express train of its development.  Nearly $1.6 trillion of the country's total foreign trade volume last year, which reached $3.86 trillion, was imports, and President Xi Jinping forecast in his keynote address at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Lima, Peru, last year that the country's import volume will reach $8 trillion in the next five years.  Thus at a time when the global economy is still facing headwinds and a protectionist trend has emerged, the expo will give fresh impetus to the promoting and facilitating of open global trade and more inclusive globalization.  Protectionism still constitutes a major menace, even though the global trade situation picked up this year following its weak performance in recent years.  With the United States looking to itself, China has become the new champion of free trade and globalization, and the aim is to establish the expo as an international public good helping to promote the Belt and Road Initiative as part of the process of global economic development, and give new impetus to economic globalization and the establishing of open and mutually beneficial world trade.  President Xi has reiterated China's firm stance on economic globalization on many major international occasions, and the expo is the first manifestation of the vow he made at the recently concluded 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that the country will adopt high-level trade and investment facilitation policies.  The expo is thus an important development for China's trade relations in the new era, and it will be a platform for different parties to discuss international trade and other major global economic issues and advance strategies to further promote economic globalization, an open world economy, and better balanced international development.

Constructive contribution to regional issues welcome,11/3/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping, right, and his US counterpart Donald Trump take a walk to further discuss bilateral cooperation issues in the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the United States, April 7, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Donald Trump's first visit to Asia as US president, which will take him to Japan, the Republic of Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, comes at a critical moment, as the missile and nuclear programs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have cast a shadow over the region. The issue is expected to feature prominently in Trump's talks.  Trump needs to reassure his hosts that the United States will play a constructive role in pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue, and it recognizes dialogue and consultation are the only feasible means to address this and other issues in the region.  Much of the speculation ahead of Trump's visit to Asia, which began on Friday, stems from the conflicting messages that have previously been given by his administration. A clear, consistent and positive message showing a willingness to cooperate and contribute constructively to resolving regional issues would go a long way toward making his trip a success.  On the regional level, Trump needs to recognize that much has changed in the region since his predecessor instigated a rebalancing to Asia strategy to reinforce the US' leadership role in the Asia-Pacific. China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are poised to formally adopt the framework for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea during a summit meeting in the Philippines later this month. Any attempt to derail this process would be unwelcome and likely trigger a backlash.  As a country that is not directly involved in the maritime disputes, and one claiming to have a stake in the peace and stability of the region and seeking to benefit from its vitality, the US should heed the wise advice that has been offered that it would be best served by seeking to facilitate this constructive process.  On a nation-to-nation level, Trump's upcoming visit to China, which will make him the first foreign head of state to visit the country after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, offers the opportunity for China and the US to iron out their differences and inject fresh vigor into their bilateral cooperation, the momentum of which should not be stalled due to their frictions over trade and other issues.  There is no reason why, meeting face-to-face, Trump and President Xi Jinping cannot recapture the rapport of their earlier ""very good dialogue"". Doing so would enable the two sides to send a positive signal that they are capable of properly handling their differences and are willing and able to work together for the good of themselves, the region and the world.

Good China-Russia ties benefit world stability,11/2/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping greets visiting Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Nov 1. Medvedev is on a three-day official visit. XIE HUANCHI / XINHUA      Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's visit to China has further cemented the all-round strategic partnership between the two countries, which was already nothing short of substantial, thanks to their cooperation and exchanges in a wide range of areas.  The meeting between Medvedev and Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday and their holding of the 22nd China-Russia Prime Ministers' Regular Meeting on Wednesday, the first after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, showcased the closeness of ties that have been forged through frequent high-level talks.  Over the past five years, for instance, President Xi Jinping has been to Russia six times, either for state visits or to participate in international activities, and Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have talked frequently on the sidelines of different multilateral meetings, which has laid a solid foundation for the countries' increasingly good relations.  And as Xi said in his meeting with Medvedev in Beijing on Wednesday, China's clear objective of advancing and deepening ties with Russia, and its steadfast resolve to do so, will not change.  The economies of both countries are complementary to each other. China's capital, market, infrastructure construction and manufacturing capacity can meet the needs of Russia's development while Russia's advanced technology and resources of both raw material and talent are what China needs for the upgrading of its economy.  Russia's development strategy dovetails with China's, which finds expression in the converging of China's development of its northeast region with Russia's development of its far east. That explains why Russia has supported China's Belt and Road Initiative from the very beginning. The economic cooperation between the two countries will be further promoted.  The good bilateral ties have made it easy for both to reach consensuses on a wide range of international issues, which has a bearing on the overall global situation and hot spot issues.  Both are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, members of the G20, BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and their joint efforts play a key role in maintaining the world's political stability.  Healthy relations between the world's major countries make a huge difference to global stability and the building of a community of shared future for all mankind. The good bilateral China-Russia relations have set a good example and will continue to contribute to these.  China and Russia will further promote their political mutual trust and substantiate their strategic partnership, which will not just be in their own interests but also the interests of the world.

Mending of ties between China and ROK is good for region,10/31/2017,"                                             The improvement in relations between China and the Republic of Korea is good news not only for the two neighbors but also for the region, since it signals the two sides are taking a pragmatic approach to the larger picture of bilateral ties, which will have a significant bearing on both peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the forging of regional cooperation.  After the ROK stated on Monday that it is not considering any additional deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, and it will not participate in US defense networks or develop its security cooperation with Japan and the United States into a tripartite military alliance, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday that the two sides have agreed to bring their relations back onto the normal track as soon as possible.  It was the decision by the previous administration in the ROK to deploy the United States' THAAD anti-missile system in response to Pyongyang's repeated reckless moves that put the freeze on relations, since China views the deployment as a threat to its security.  However, China and the ROK maintained communication regarding the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through diplomatic channels, and they have agreed to enhance their communication, including through military-to-military channels, in pursuit of their shared aim of achieving a peaceful resolution to the issue.  Since both countries are important stakeholders in peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, their restored rapport will help them better coordinate their stances in response to the deteriorating relations between the DPRK and the US that threaten to spark a military conflict.  And by showing their shared will to properly handle their differences over THAAD, the two neighbors can now revive their economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, which have borne the brunt of the downturn in bilateral ties over past months.  This will also enable them to better fulfill their responsibilities and contribute more to regional integration by making concerted efforts.  As regional economic powerhouses, China and the ROK, along with Japan, have been long-time cooperative partners and participants in the regional integration process led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and they are being looked upon to play a bigger role in regional development by other countries in the region.  The thaw in China-ROK ties will hopefully be a shot in the arm to efforts to forge regional solidarity and cooperation at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders' Meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, and the series of East Asia high-level meetings in Manila, the Philippines, next month.

Signs ROK and China can turn the page on THAAD,10/31/2017,"                              People protest against the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in front of the Lotte Headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, Feb 27, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Republic of Korea Foreign Minister Kang Kyungwha reportedly told lawmakers on Monday that the country is not considering any additional deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system. She also reiterated that the ROK will not be part of the US-led missile defense networks.  Such remarks are valuable because they suggest Seoul has heeded Beijing's security concerns and is taking steps to get their strained relations back on track.  Kang's remarks follow other signs of a thaw in bilateral relations. On Tuesday the ROK's chief representative in the Six-Party Talks will meet his Chinese counterpart in Beijing, one week after the first talks in nearly two years were held between the two countries' defense chiefs at a security forum in the Philippines.  A meeting has also reportedly been slated between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his ROK counterpart Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting to be held in Vietnam on Nov 10-11.  China has always opposed the deployment of THAAD in the ROK as part of the missile defense networks the US is trying to establish because its powerful radar can probe deep into the country and harm its national security. Yet it has never wavered in seeking to resolve the diplomatic dispute by maintaining close communications and exchanges with the ROK. Beijing understands the ROK's security concerns regarding the latest development on the Korean Peninsula.  That China and the ROK are pursuing ways to improve their relations reflects the fact that their common interests outweigh their differences and that the two neighbors share the desire to turn the page.  This is timely since the growing tensions between Pyongyang and Washington threaten to become more than just a war of words. At such a critical time, Beijing and Seoul can work together to be a voice of reason. For with the escalating war rhetoric from Pyongyang and Washington, Beijing and Seoul stand in the same trench calling for the same thing: the maintaining of regional peace and stability.  The rapport they seem to have regained is testament to the resilience of their relations, which have brought real benefits to the people of both countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties 25 years ago. China hopes the ROK will fulfill the commitments it has made. Both sides should treasure and strengthen this hard-won strategic and cooperative partnership.         "
Commemoration of Nanjing Massacre in Canada matters,10/30/2017,"                      Manitoba became the second province in Canada to propose recognizing and commemorating the Nanjing Massacre when its legislature passed the second reading of the Nanjing Massacre Commemorative Day Act, or Bill 233, on Thursday, immediately after the Ontario provincial parliament passed a motion to do the same.  Motion 66 was passed in the Ontario provincial parliament, if enacted into law it will establish Dec 13 as Nanjing Massacre Commemoration Day. This would be the first of its kind in a Western country, and Canada would become the first Western country where a day has been designated to commemorate the tragedy, in which invading Japanese forces massacred more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants over six weeks in December 1937 and January 1938, after their capture of the city.  What the two Canadian provinces have done is, first of all, of significance to ensure the world remembers the victims of the atrocity, but it can also serve to facilitate the elimination of the militarist mindset in Japan.  The immediate onset of Cold War after the end of World War II turned the defeated Japan into an ally of the United States, which helped to shield it from completely reflecting on its war crimes. That explains why some of its war criminals failed to get the punishment they deserved for the crimes they committed, and also why there have always been some Japanese politicians, who have tried their best to whitewash what the invading Japanese forces did to their neighbors.  To commemorate the Nanjing Massacre-one of the most heinous war crimes Japanese invading forces committed during their invasion of Asian countries-not just in China, but also in other countries, is more than simply just a token gesture to China and many other Asian countries whose people suffered at the hands of the occupying Japanese. It should also help more of the world know what Japanese invading forces did to the countries and peoples they invaded, so that more countries, not just those countries that were victims of Japan's aggression, hold up a mirror to the past so those in Japan who would rewrite history, are unable to do so.  As a result, more people in more countries will hopefully designate imperial Japan's militarism as a stain on history, and exert pressure on those Japanese politicians who shamefully try and peddle a wrong view of history to change their ways. Only when these politicians have the courage to change their attitude toward that part of history and Japan really repents for what its militarist ambitions inflicted on its neighbors will it be possible for it to really reconcile with its neighbors.

Japan cutting itself off from trend of the times,10/26/2017,"                                             In recent years, Japan has developed a penchant for confronting China over issues of regional and international significance even though China's stance on these issues is fair and reasonable. Japan's proposal of a strategic dialogue with leaders of the United States, India and Australia, announced by its Foreign Minister Taro Kono this week, is another example of this.  According to Japanese media, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to float the idea to US President Donald Trump during his visit to the region next month.  As for the purpose of the Japanese proposal, Kono felt no need to cover up one of Japan's objectives, telling Japanese media that the aim is to counter China's expanding influence as a result of its Belt and Road Initiative.  Since the initiative was first proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, it has won the support of more than 100 countries and international organizations, and more than 40 countries have signed cooperation agreements with China under the framework.  These countries and organizations have all recognized the immense opportunities offered by the initiative, which seeks to connect Asia with Europe and Africa and promote common development and shared prosperity.  The initiative has already reaped early harvests despite the sluggish global economic recovery, flagging international trade and a major backlash against globalization. As such, Japan's intention to defame the China-proposed initiative this time is doomed to fail.   By unfairly putting an expansionist tag on the initiative, Japan is cutting itself off from the opportunities which the majority of countries have perceived in it. And it will have little effect in slowing the momentum with which the initiative is being rolled out since those that have less of a bias against China recognize it is a platform for nourishing inclusive growth.  However, due to its strained ties with China as a result of their territorial dispute and its concerns about having lost status because of China's growing influence in the region, Japan has been ramping up its efforts to oppose China in regional and international issues.   Japan already has a trilateral strategic dialogue with Australia and the US, and one with India and the US, so by seeking to revive the old momentum for the so-called quad, it has also revealed its intention to try and hinder the efforts of China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to ease tensions in the South China Sea, which have recently made significant progress with the agreement on a framework for a Code of Conduct in the waters.  Tokyo should not try and push its own zero-sum agenda. Such a mentality, a legacy left over from the Cold War era, goes against the trend of the times which favors interconnected growth and shared prosperity.          "
China will open further in new era to benefit all,10/26/2017,"                              Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivers a speech when meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Oct 25, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    In the report he delivered at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, announced that socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era.    It is an era that is not only of tremendous importance to China but also to the world. For it is an era that, as Xi pointed out, is not only full of hope but also full of challenges, which no country alone can tackle. Hence his call for countries to work together to build a community of shared future for all mankind.  Thus, as it strives to achieve its ""Two Centenary Goals"", establishing a moderately prosperous society by 2020 and a great modern socialist nation by 2049, China will continue to open its door to the world and press ahead with reform.  In doing so, it will not only advance its own development, but also acquire greater capabilities to drive global economic growth and promote common development.  Openness brings progress, as Xi noted, and the further opening-up of the country will ensure China's interaction with the rest of the world is positive and encouraging of reciprocity for mutual gains.  In light of this, the world needs to say no to the outdated practice of viewing relations among nations as a zero-sum game, and instead act on the reality that no country alone can address the many challenges facing mankind, and no country can afford to act solely on self-interest.  In the new era, while sticking to its path of peaceful development, a stronger China will contribute more to world peace and development. And it will continue to act on its belief that people benefit most from international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and cooperation.  By sticking together through thick and thin, and making economic globalization open, inclusive and balanced, so that its benefits can be better shared by all, countries in the world can forge solidarity to overcome the common challenges they face and so secure shared development and prosperity.  As the latest Party Congress shows, China is fully confident and capable of ushering in a better future for itself in the new era and making a significant contribution to advance the trends of interconnectedness and interdependence for the betterment of all.               "
CPC shows its confidence in Xi's thought for new era,10/25/2017,"                              Xi Jinping presides over the closing session of the 19th CPC National Congress on Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. LAN HONGGUANG / XINHUA      Besides the examining of the Party's road map for the country and electing a new Central Committee and its Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the 19th Communist Party of China National Congress concluded with a high-profile amendment to its Constitution that is nothing short of historic.  Historic since it features the all-round inscription of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Party's new thinking on governance.  All-round in that it does not simply juxtapose Xi's thought with the CPC's ideological guidelines to date-Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development.  Literally all the phrases defining Xi's perspective on governance-from the CPC's self-regulation to absolute control over the military and ""all undertakings"", to the Belt and Road Initiative and his proposal for countries to build a community of shared future for all mankind-have found their way into the CPC Constitution in the most comprehensive amendment it has seen in decades.  As was obvious from the Tuesday morning vote, this is the result of unanimous intraparty endorsement, a reflection of the proud achievements the Party has accomplished over the past five years. Particularly so because the Party's leadership, with Xi at its core, has sustained the popular belief that the country is on the right development path amid the global economic woes.  Not that this country has been immune to the undesirable. The recognition of an economic new normal, for one, signaled that the era of consecutive double-digit growth was over and gone. Xi's inauguration of the New Era, too, is also based on a cool-headed acknowledgement of the changed, and changing, conditions for the country's pursuit of rejuvenation.  What has made the CPC confident, however, is China continues outperforming most of the rest of the world in spite of all the challenges.  The CPC Constitution's all-round embracing of Xi's thought reflects the high degree of consensus the Party has built around its leadership core. That is a hallmark not only of intraparty unity, but more importantly of the shared conviction that its approach to both development and governance is the correct one.  Given Xi's-and now officially the Party's-aspiration for a community of shared future for all mankind, there is no reason for the country to be ""assertive"" on the global stage as some in the West are speculating. But the CPC certainly will be more steadfast in sticking to its own approach, which it is more ready than ever to share with the rest of the world.         "
CPC leadership has vision for building a better world,10/24/2017,"                              A group of tourists, with their children waving national flags, walks through Tian'anmen Square in Beijing over the weekend. Behind them is the Great Hall of the People, where the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has been meeting since last week to set the course of the country's future. [Photo by Edmond Tang/China Daily]      China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has blazed a new trail for economic and social progress that has not only led the country to its own economic prosperity, but also shown a way in which the rest of the world can overcome the various stumbling blocks that are hindering the progress of both developed and developing countries.  Where you go decides which path you take, and which path you take has a bearing on what you will finally get. The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has been successful for China not least because it works with the country's particular realities.  For the majority of developing countries, the China model can serve as a reminder that the Western political system and capitalism are not imperative for improving the lives of their peoples. They may learn from China that they can stick to their own political systems, their traditional cultures and their own national characteristics, and can sieve and adapt from the prior development experiences of the West, as long as they find the right path to integrate their own advantages with the right choices for economic development and social progress.  The world is in urgent need of collective efforts to secure global development and peace, especially with the world's largest economy resorting to an all-for-itself approach and reneging on its agreements and global responsibilities.  The building of a community of shared future for all mankind that General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed in his report to the 19th National Congress of the CPC on Wednesday offers a vision of where such a collective journey could lead.  To build such a community, the world needs to seek a one-sum game, in which all the parties involved can benefit, rather than a zero-sum one, in which the winners profit at the expense of the losers. With this in mind, cooperation should always come before competition, and compromises are necessary in one form or another.  To create an environment conducive to forging such a community, the world's governing mechanism must be inclusive and accommodating, so that more countries can participate.  China's leadership has a vision for a destination far beyond their own country's future, one that is about the building of a better world for all people rather than any one country's prosperity; this will not be achievable unless the entire world develops in a sustainable manner.  It is little wonder that the 19th CPC National Congress has attracted the world's attention and will have an impact on where the world will go.         "
Abe should match words with deeds,10/24/2017,"                              Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gestures during a press conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 21, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's landslide victory in Japan's lower house election on Sunday has further consolidated support for his ultra-right political agenda and will no doubt embolden him to raise the status of Japan's defense forces, a prospect that will not be regarded as good news in the region.  As is known to all, Abe has been advocating constitutional revisions for years. In 2014, his administration reinterpreted Article 9 to give Japan the right to exercise collective self-defense. One year later, he forced the passage of controversial security-related bills through parliament, allowing expanded overseas roles for Japan's Self-Defense Forces.  Now, Sunday's victory has granted Abe's conservative coalition a two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament. The result comes as no surprise, as the opposition is weak and fragmented, and no match for Abe's ruling coalition, but it means Abe now has the opportunity to try and change the country's ""pacifist"" Constitution.  However, Abe should bear in mind that the Japanese public is strongly opposed to any amendment, as manifested both in polls and in the massive protests over the security bills in 2015. On top of that, any attempt to change the Constitution would also trigger a strong backlash in the region, drawing the ire of neighboring countries including China.  Abe has from time to time articulated the wish to improve bilateral ties with China, the latest example being his expression of hope of achieving an exchange of visits by leaders from both sides.  But as a seasoned politician, he should understand that he holds the key for improving ties in his own hand, as he has single-handedly thrown bilateral ties off balance with his stance and actions.  Rather than simply paying lip service to improving ties, Abe needs to match his words with actions and adopt a proactive policy to restore neighborly relations with China.         "
Focus now on addressing unbalanced development,10/23/2017,"                              The press center of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China holds a news conference on people's livelihood in Beijing, Oct 22, 2017. [Photo by Edmond Tang/China Daily]      With General Secretary Xi Jinping declaring the dawn of a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and redefining the primary contradiction of present-day China in his speech at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the backwardness of social production has officially been rendered a thing of the past.  And, now that the country has become a key supplier of consumer products the world over, from sneakers to personal computers to iPhones; now that domestic industries are increasingly visible at the forefront of new technologies, from big commercial airliners to quantum satellites; now that the government is aspiring to turn the country into a global innovation leader in a dozen years, it does indeed seem anachronistic to continue defining the primary contradiction as being between backward production capacity and people's growing demands. Especially since overcapacity has been the headache for multiple traditional industries.  Thus the new primary contradiction, which identifies the country's fundamental task in the new era as tackling unbalanced, inadequate development, makes sense, because, while retaining the longstanding emphasis on upgrading production capacity, it incorporates the idea of balance.  Balance, as Xi stressed, encompasses both geographical and demographical aspects. Imbalance exists not only between regions, but also between groups and stratums of society.  For while the national economic landscape has by and large taken on a new look over the years, and people's livelihoods have dramatically improved, not all areas and people have benefited equally in the process. And given its role in leading national development, and its unmatched command of public resources, the government is in the best position to address the imbalances that have emerged, especially the imbalances resulting from unfair distribution.  As Sunday's news conference, featuring five central government ministries, made explicit, impressive progress has been made over the past five years: social security guarantees for the underprivileged have improved, education, from kindergartens to colleges, has become more accessible, there is more subsidized housing for low-income citizens, medical reforms have made health services more convenient and affordable.  But there is still a long way to go, and while capacity building will continue to be a theme for national development, it is clear that in line with the CPC's new judgment, the focus now will be making development better balanced.  Thus, as the country shifts the emphasis of development from speed to quality, the central theme of the new era will be honoring Xi's promise to boost people's sense of gain.         "
Economy defies doomsayers,10/20/2017,"                              Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China. [Photo provided to China Daily]    China's economic growth looks set to accelerate this year, the first time in seven years, after it registered a 6.8 percent year-on-year GDP growth in the third quarter. Given that growth trend has been achieved against the backdrop of both domestic structural reforms and the still fragile global economic recovery, it showcases the exceptional resilience of the world's second-largest economy.  China's GDP growth in the first three quarters has been in stark contrast to the scenario depicted by many doomsayers late last year. Even more reassuring, while a variety of economic indicators are showing signs of steady growth, the country has also made much headway in carrying out the tough task of economic restructuring.  Industrial output growth, for example, increased to 6.7 percent in the first three quarters from 6 percent a year ago, with high-tech manufacturing and equipment-making industries, which are the backbone of a country's industrial development, showing brisk performance. The growth in their output was 13.4 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively, 6.7 percentage points and 4.9 percentage points higher than that of overall industrial output.  Another case in point is retail sales growth, which remained strong at 10.4 percent in the January-September period. Although that was unchanged compared with a year ago, online sales increased by 34.2 percent, 8.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, indicating the bigger role played by this new driving force for consumption.  In terms of the supply-side structural reform, China has continued to reduce its leverage levels and the country's investment in environmental protection, public facility management and agriculture all registered much higher growth than overall investment expansion.  Such encouraging fundamentals have been achieved thanks to the government striving for innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development.  As Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said on Wednesday, while expansion of economic scale remains important, top priority must be given to the quality of growth.  It is a focus that will ensure sustainable long-term growth.               "
Effective anti-graft efforts ensure clean governance,10/20/2017,"                                   Given the role it plays in running the country, how the Communist Party of China governs itself is of the utmost importance.  That explains why strictly governing the Party is one of the CPC Central Committee's four fundamental strategies and why the pledge was made to persist with the anti-corruption campaign until it attained sweeping victory over this threat to the Party.  And, as CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping said in his report at the opening of the 19th CPC National Congress on Wednesday, great achievements have been made in honoring that pledge and strictly governing the Party.  Even if one didn't know the number of officials that have been and are being investigated, it is not hard to appreciate how different the Party and government officials' working style is now compared with five years ago. One only has to look at how careful they have become when spending public money.  However, the figures released at Thursday's news conference, where officials from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection talked about the fight against corruption in the past five years, give substance to the Party leadership's claims of progress in getting rid of the Party's bad apples.  More than 8,000 officials at bureau levels and more than 60,000 officials at county level have been given disciplinary penalties. And the fact that 440 officials at or above ministerial level-among whom 43 were members or alternate members of the CPC Central Committee-have either been indicted or are being investigated for abuses of power, demonstrates how resolute the leadership has been in its efforts to stop the rot.  Disciplinary inspections by teams sent by the CPC Central Committee have proved to be an effective tool in uncovering cases of graft and corrupt officials.  Meanwhile, China has been working with the international community to hunt down corruption suspects who have fled overseas and seize their illegal assets. And of the 3,453 fugitives who have returned to face justice, 48 were among the top 100 fugitives listed on an Interpol red notice. This has also brought home the fact that there is no safe haven for those who seek to enrich themselves through graft.  The intra-Party disciplinary, graft prevention and supervision mechanism that is being formed is putting power in a cage and ensuring that Party members do not dare to, and are not able to, benefit from graft.               "
Guidelines that can help build a genuinely global community,10/19/2017,"                              Xi Jinping delivers a report to the 19th CPC National Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Oct 18, 2017. [Photo by Xu Jingxing/chinadaily.com.cn]    In his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on Wednesday, General Secretary Xi Jinping said that China will always try to be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.    He also said that while China will never give up the interest and benefit it deserves to get, it will never pursue its own development at the expense of other countries.  He admonished that no country or individual should expect China to swallow anything that undermines its own interests. He also said that China's defense policy is defensive in nature, and it will never pose a threat to any country, and China will never seek hegemony or follow an expansionist policy no matter how strong the country becomes.  These remarks are not only the guidelines on which China's diplomacy will be based, but also serve to explicitly tell the world what role China has been playing and what role it intends to play.  His remarks are by no means only rhetoric.  Look at the aid in various forms China has offered to countries in need. Look at the diplomatic efforts China has made in helping to settle conflicts and disputes worldwide. Look at the Belt and Road Initiative that is realizing common development with the countries along the ancient Silk Road routes spanning Asia, Africa and Europe.  By getting an increasing number of countries involved in the initiative, China has not only given substance to Xi's words, it has also innovated a development model of cooperation for mutual benefits.  That explains why China has called for countries to build a community of shared destiny for all mankind, which instead of being a zero-sum game in which the gains of one are offset by the losses of others, is a one-sum game in which everyone contributes what they can for the benefits of all.  As Xi said in his report, the Chinese people's dream of a better life is of the same nature as that of people around the world.  And since realizing that global dream requires a peaceful and stable environment worldwide, China remains committed to its independent foreign policy of peace, steadfastedly upholds fairness and justice in international affairs, and opposes any country imposing its will on other countries or interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, gainsaying the practice of the strong bullying the weak.  By so saying and so doing, China not only respects the right of the people of all countries to choose their own path of development, it is also using its growing influence and power in a responsible way and demonstrating its resolve to uphold the equality of all countries in international relations.  China is still a developing country, but it will continue to contribute what it can to the building of a better world and offer new ideas and concepts in pursuit of this goal.  This is because the Chinese leadership well knows that China's peace and prosperity will not be sustainable unless the world is also peaceful and stable.  This explains why China advocates inclusiveness and mutual learning and promotes dialogue among different countries and cultures, and why China will continue to strive to guide countries to make concerted efforts to build a community of shared destiny.  As Xi's speech showed, the world is entering a new era. It is one in which China has the resolve, confidence and capability to be a banner bearer for a new type of relations.  This has ruffled some feathers, and will no doubt continue to ruffle them, but the fact that some still cling desperately to an outdated mindset will not stop the hands of the clock from turning.  Times have changed and in the face of the common non-traditional threats such as climate change and terrorism, the pursuit of a community of shared destiny for all mankind conforms to the trends of the times.  By adhering to the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, China will strive to work with others to realize the common aspiration of the people of all countries for peace, development, cooperation and progress.

Achievements give people confidence in Party's leadership,10/18/2017,"                              Xi Jinping presides over the preparatory meeting for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, Oct 17, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    As delegates of the Communist Party of China meet to examine what the country has been through and accomplished over the past five years, they will also deliberate on the future and what needs to be done.    As the communiqué issued on Saturday after the conclusion of the seventh, and last, plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee indicates, the 19th National Congress is essentially about ascertaining what has been tried and tested over the past five years and how to carry that forward.  And as reflected in many recent surveys gauging Chinese citizens' feelings about the future, what the 2,500-character text conveys is first and foremost confidence the Party's leaders are charting the right course for the country.  In the words of the communiqué, the past five years have been extraordinary years in which the nation has made historic achievements in reform and opening-up, and undergone fundamental changes with many deep-rooted problems and issues that were too difficult to be resolved before now being addressed. Not least corruption, where the unprecedentedly resolute anti-graft campaign has made remarkable headway.  As a result, China stands at a new historical starting point, which is of great and far-reaching significance for the country's development cause and the realization of its two centenary goals.  There are those outside the country that might try to suggest otherwise. China is no stranger to doom-mongering. But from predictions that it will experience an economic hard landing to claims that it faces total collapse, people in this country have heard it all before, and more than once.  Heard it and each time dismissed it, knowing it is such prophecies that have struggled to gain traction and eventually collapsed. For, each time China has faced storms that threaten to blow it off course, its leaders have demonstrated their acumen by steering the country safely through each tempest.  Today, China's economy continues to drive global growth, prompting the International Monetary Fund to raise its expectations, four times already this year. More important, people's lives have improved, not least the lives of many of the country's poorest residents, as 14 million people have been lifted out of poverty each year since 2012.  And as CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping has observed, this nation has never been so close to center stage when it comes to global affairs.  Beyond what IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde cited the other day as the reason the entire world will be watching what unfolds at the congress-the country's role as an economic powerhouse for the global economy-people around the world will also be hoping to gain some insight into how this country intends to wield its growing influence in the coming years.  If fact, the world already knows the country's intentions since Xi has reiterated on many occasions it seeks to forge a community of shared destiny for all humans, and he has made clear the nation's territorial integrity is its bottom line.  No matter whether suspicious outsiders can or are willing to appreciate its vision of a global community living in harmony, the country has garnered the endorsement of many in the international community for its championing of shared and inclusive development and its providing of beneficial public goods such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which in turn have encouraged increased confidence in its approach to global governance.  And throughout Chinese society, there is a broadening consensus that the country, as well as the world, needs strong, efficient leadership. That is what Xi and his colleagues have presented, and what they have received praise for, not only at home but also elsewhere.  By carrying out the great project of Party building and advancing the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, Xi and his colleagues have instilled the belief that they can meet the challenges of the times and so realize the Chinese people's dream of the rejuvenation of the nation.  As the communiqué noted, the past five years have been an extraordinary period in which the Party's efforts to unite and lead the country have produced comprehensive and groundbreaking achievements. This momentum will be sustained over the coming years with the advancing of the Party's new governance concepts, thoughts and strategies.                  "
New diplomatic approach is practical and cosmopolitan,10/17/2017,"                              Red flags on the Tian'anmen Square and atop the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]    An amendment to the constitution of the Communist Party of China incorporating the latest concepts, theories and strategies of the leadership is to be submitted for review to the Party's 19th National Congress, which begins on Wednesday.  Among these developments are its new diplomatic thinking and approach.  Instead of viewing relations as a zero-sum game, the diplomatic ideas and proposals introduced by President Xi Jinping encourage countries to build a community of shared destiny based on win-win cooperation and the pursuit of inclusive and common development.  Xi first proposed countries work together to forge such a community during a visit to Russia in March 2013. Since then, he has expounded on the concept on more than 100 occasions both at home and abroad.  This new vision, based on an insightful grasp of the changing international situation and the trends of the times, embodies Chinese wisdom and its perspectives for reforming and improving the global governance system.  With such a goal, it is natural that China should seek to develop friendly and reciprocal ties with countries around the world, especially those on its periphery, and natural that it should adhere to the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in its relations with other countries.  Thus, despite the territorial disputes that exist between China and some members of the regional organization, relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are in good shape, as shown by their recent agreement on the framework for a code of conduct for the South China Sea, which marks a breakthrough in their efforts to resolve the disputes.  At the same time, China's improved relationship with the Philippines has set a good example for countries on how to properly handle their differences.  No matter how the international situation changes, and despite some still trying to point an accusing finger at China for causing frictions in the region, citing its strained ties with its neighbors Japan and the Republic of Korea, China remains committed to peace and common prosperity.  However, no one should misjudge or underestimate China's resolve to defend its territorial and security interests.  China's vision of a community of shared destiny means it will continue to seek a new type of major-country relations and it will endeavor to establish a fairer global governance system and promote common security.  Its goal is not to replace the existing order but to play a more proactive role in guiding countries toward the realization of its vision for an international community that is not at odds with one another, and instead acts on the awareness that we all live on the same planet that is our shared and only home.               "
US' dangerous attitude to Iran,10/16/2017,"                      US President Donald Trump on Friday officially disavowed the international nuclear deal with Iran, calling it weak and poorly constructed. He has given the US Congress days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions that had been lifted on Iran and said that he may seek to terminate the deal.  Iran responded strongly to his comments, with its foreign minister saying that it has the right to make a decision on its presence in the deal if the United States re-imposes sanctions.  If the US' actions lead to Iran resuming its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, it will plunge the Middle East into an arms race, and make the unstable situation in the region even more chaotic.  It is obvious that US' change in attitude on this question is also further estranging itself from its allies in Europe, as the leaders of Britain, Germany and France declared their backing for the deal and said it is in their shared interest.  The US government is showing no respect to the other signatories in criticizing the deal and is disregarding what the International Atomic Energy Agency has done in keeping an eye on Iran to ensure it abides by the deal.  An increasingly unstable Middle East and estrangement between the US and its European allies will considerably compromise the global efforts to fight international terrorism, which will very likely take advantage of the opportunity to become even more rampant.  Pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran that took 13 years of international efforts to agree on will also greatly damage the reputation of the US. It would also deal a heavy blow to the international community's nuclear non-proliferation efforts and set a bad precedent that would make it even more difficult to peacefully resolve the Korean Peninsula deadlock.  To put it simply, it would make the world more unsafe and more chaotic.         "
Grand vision for connectivity revives the Silk Road spirit,10/16/2017,"                              A group of foreign diplomats and foreign experts working in China visit an exhibition in Beijing on 13,Oct,2017 showcasing China's achievements over the past five years. ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILY    According to a communiqué issued after the Seventh Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which concluded in Beijing on Saturday, the Party's constitution will be amended to represent the new governance concepts, thoughts and strategies of the CPC Central Committee.    Among these is its vision for innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development with the rest of the world.  It is almost 10 years since the onset of the global financial crisis and the world economy continues to reel from its fallout: The growth prospects for many countries remain gloomy, the wealth gaps between the rich and poor are widening, and protectionism and anti-globalization are on the rise.  Against this backdrop, China has become the ballast for global economic stability and a champion of openness and shared prosperity.  It is therefore natural that countries, especially emerging economies and those hit hard by the slowdown, should look to China for ways to escape the doldrums.  One of the solutions China has offered is the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen connectivity in policy, infrastructure, trade and people-to-people exchanges between countries along the ancient Silk Road routes that spanned Asia, Europe and Africa.  This grand vision of global affinity was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, based on the recognition that all countries are interdependent and form a close-knit community of interwoven destinies and interests.  It is an ambitious undertaking that seeks to realize the common aspiration for greater understanding between peoples, the collective yearning for peace and stability and the communal pursuit of the shared dream for a better life.  The Initiative has been well supported since it was rolled out in the last couple of years. So far more than 100 countries and international organizations have embraced the Initiative.  This revival of the Silk Road spirit emphasizes fairness and the sharing of development opportunities, and for that purpose, China is advocating and striving for a global economic governance system that is rules-based, transparent and non-discriminatory, with greater representation for emerging and developing economies.  And since development cannot be advanced without security, China is also advocating that countries work together for common security and make concerted efforts to address the political and social roots of conflicts.  There have been setbacks to economic globalization and regional integration efforts in recent years, but cooperation for peaceful development remains the global trend and endeavor. As a longtime driver and promoter of this trend, China will continue to seek greater cooperation for shared development and global stability.               "
China will continue to make its contribution,10/13/2017,"                              A technician inspects the surface of a stainless steel component at a factory of Shanxi-based Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co, which is staking its future on research and development efforts. [Photo provided to China Daily]      The preparations for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China are in full swing, and the event is drawing the attention of the whole world. Not only because it will herald some new faces among the country's top leaders, but also because it will outline policies to chart China's growth over the coming years.  As proved over the past five years, a stable and prosperous China matters for both the country and the world.  Amid a time of lingering global economic recession, China has remained the world's major economic engine-contributing one-third of global growth-despite its restructuring pains ranging from cutting excess production capacity to containing leverage and asset bubbles.  It is also working together with other countries to promote inclusive and interconnected growth for shared prosperity, contributing its wisdom and practical solutions to help build an open global economy.  It has rolled out a new model for achieving win-win cooperation, the Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to integrate bilateral economic and trade cooperation with multilateral and regional partnerships, and it has established institutional platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Silk Road Fund to help fund greater connectivity.  China has also played a pivotal role in driving regional growth by pushing ahead with proposals to establish the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific as institutional mechanisms to safeguard free trade in the region.  China's success in finding a dynamic development path has also greatly benefited other developing economies by providing relevant experiences and practical assistance.  For instance, its exemption of debts to some African nations as well as its massive investment in the continent-which has strengthened infrastructure and created job opportunities-has helped boost African growth.  As a beneficiary and participant of free trade and globalization, China will continue to champion globalization and play a leading role in advocating and promoting free trade despite the lurch toward protectionism in the West. As President Xi Jinping said at the Davos World Economic Forum in early January, boosting open economies is a remedy for the global sluggishness.  China's willingness to shoulder its responsibilities in response to global challenges was fully demonstrated at last year's G20 summit in Hangzhou. As the host, China widened the participation and worked hard to create consensus. Its efforts resulted in a number of important outcomes that will help improve global governance.  That commitment to addressing global challenges with concerted efforts will undoubtedly be reaffirmed at the upcoming 19th CPC National Congress.         "
Good conditions to finish tasks,10/13/2017,"                              A worker monitors container operation at Zhoushan port in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. [Photo/China Daily]      With the Chinese economy expanding steadily in the first two quarters, the International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for the country's GDP growth for the year to 6.8 percent, up from its prediction of 6.7 percent in April.  The adjustment, which came on Tuesday, coincided with the sanguine view of Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, that the country will certainly meet its growth target for the year, which is ""around 6.5 percent"".  The consensus among mainstream domestic and international analysts will instill confidence that the world's second-largest economy can continue to help anchor the global economic recovery.  That said, the Chinese economy, as the IMF pointed out in its latest World Economic Outlook report, does face some serious challenges, such as potential financial risks caused by the piling up of debts.  But the Chinese authorities are staying sober-minded and are taking pains to tame the scale of debts. For example, the country has reduced the debt ratio of its major industrial enterprises, in terms of asset-liability ratio, by 0.7 of a percentage point in the first eight months compared with a year ago.  Still, it remains an urgent task for China to control financial risks. On the one hand, it needs to better allocate its financial resources to support the growth of the real economy, especially to some key emerging industries, so as to lay a solid ground for future sustainable growth.  On the other hand, it must improve financial oversight to prevent liquidity from flowing into already white-hot sectors, such as the property market, and accelerate corporate reform to squeeze out those insolvent ""zombie enterprises"" to prevent corporate debts from ballooning.  What is reassuring is that the country's stable growth prospects, as the IMF forecast confirms, have created more favorable conditions for carrying out those tasks.         "
People-first development will remain the priority,10/12/2017,"                              Journalists take books and materials in the press conference hall of the Press Center of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 11, 2017. The press center based in the Beijing Media Center Hotel began operations on Wednesday. (Xinhua/Li Xin)      ""Our people look forward to better education, a more stable job, a more satisfactory income… and expect their children to grow up, work and live better,"" Xi Jinping said in his first news conference after he was elected general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in November 2012.  Such plain and down-to-earth words set the priorities for China's development over the past five years, and the policy measures rolled out since then have time and again proved that the Party under Xi's leadership has remained steadfast in its pursuit of a better life for the people. This as he said ""is the goal of our struggle"", and he and the Party have shouldered the responsibility to lead the Chinese people in overcoming the difficulties they encounter on the road to common prosperity.  What has been achieved in that struggle and the progress made in advancing along that road over the last five years will be highlighted at the upcoming 19th National Congress of the CPC, where Xi will also outline the tasks and priorities for the country's endeavors over the next five years.  The precedence given to improving people's livelihoods is reflected in the fact that despite China's slower growth in recent years, the top leadership has consistently made job creation a key task, as shown by the creation of more than 13 million new jobs for urban residents annually and its success in keeping the urban jobless rate below 4 percent.  This has by no means been an easy task for the world's most populous country, particularly at a time when the country has been going all out to promote economic and structural adjustments and reduce overcapacity.  The people-first approach is also evidenced in the long list of achievements that have been made in poverty alleviation. The impoverished population in rural areas has been reduced by 13 million a year from 2013 to 2016, which, together with the top leadership's ambitious, but attainable, goal of pulling all residents out of poverty by 2020, will create a notable poverty alleviation achievement.  Without a people-oriented development philosophy and targeted policy measures, the completion of such a seemingly impossible task would be out of the question.  That no one in the country remains living in poverty will also be the fulfillment of Xi's vow to ensure that ""no single person is left behind on our road to building a moderately prosperous society"".  Fruitful employment creation and effective poverty alleviation efforts, along with healthcare reforms and the rolling out of government-subsidized housing nationwide as part of the effort to implement the top leadership's philosophy that ""housing is for habitation, not for speculation"", uphold Xi's words that development should be for the people and its fruits should be shared by all.

Lam highlights pragmatic solutions,10/11/2017,"                      On Wednesday, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor presented her first policy address since taking office as chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in July, making clear that her focus is on improving people's livelihoods.   The snapshot of the policies she presented clearly showed that she knows what Hong Kong needs to remain competitive and prosperous — good governance, an innovative economy and high-quality talent, as well as practical measures such as tax cuts and more subsidized housing.   Words such as technology and innovation were peppered throughout her speech as urgent requirements if Hong Kong is to reinvent itself for the new era. And with this in mind, the government intends to support eight key areas to help the SAR catch up in the innovation and technology race.  Her address also showed she recognizes that there is no better way to revive Hong Kong's fortunes than by taking full advantage of the opportunities presented by the national development strategies.  So while introducing policies to encourage Hong Kong to become a ""smart city"" and hotbed for technology and innovation, her government will also implement tailor-made policies to help Hong Kong assume an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area.  And in a welcome move to heal the generational divide in the SAR, she said the government will seek to address young people's concerns about education, jobs and home ownership, and encourage their participation in public policy discussions.   Initial reactions to Lam's policy address indicate Hong Kong society appreciates her bid to take a proactive and holistic approach to solving the SAR's problems.          "
Tsai's harmful prevarication,10/11/2017,"                              Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan, April 15, 2015. [Photo/IC]      Even before she delivered her speech to mark the ""national day of the Republic of China"" on Tuesday, it was not difficult to predict what approach Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the ""independence"" advocating administration on the island, would take with regard to cross-Straits relations.  It was thus no surprise that she continued to play her word games, saying Taiwan offered its greatest goodwill to the mainland, and carried on beating about the bush by calling for the continuation of contacts and talks between the island and the mainland, and the setting aside of political differences.  She knows as well as anyone that there is no hope of any breakthrough in cross-Straits relations unless her government explicitly upholds the 1992 Consensus, which requires both sides recognize that there is only one China.  Tsai has refused to acknowledge the one-China principle since taking office. But, at the same time, she is well aware that expressing her will to secede the island from China would be disastrous. Instead, she has prevaricated on cross-Straits relations, and continues to do so.  The mainland will not concede an inch on the one-China principle. Tsai should give up any delusions she might have to the contrary.  It is in the interests of people on both sides of the Straits for Tsai to develop good relations with the mainland by recognizing the one-China principle. Her stubbornness in refusing to do so will only lead to the further deterioration of relations, and betrays that she is putting her own pretensions before the well-being of the residents on the island.         "
Five principles to leverage period of opportunity,10/11/2017,"                      Many Chinese aphorisms urge people to work hard. Few urge them to work smarter, but that, as the country's leadership has made clear, is what is needed now.  Although it is its hard work that has propelled the country's rapid economic growth since the launch of reform and opening-up, and which has seen it become the world's second-largest economy, the dividends from this labor are diminishing, not only because its population is aging, but also because the world is on the cusp of a new industrial revolution, one that requires brains, not brawn.  China was a late participant in the first three industrial revolutions; it is determined to be one of the leaders of the fourth. That is why it is emphasizing a skilled workforce, and why, over the past five years, it has prioritized further opening-up and creating an environment conducive to innovation.  The aim is to make Made in China no longer synonymous with goods produced in the ""world's factory"", but instead an emblem of its ingenuity and inventiveness, and a badge of honor for its competitiveness.  The pursuit of innovation and smart industry is by no means a makeshift move. At its 18th National Congress in 2012, the Communist Party of China made fostering innovation a priority for national development, and two years later the country's leaders called for mass innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit. A comprehensive 10-year action plan was introduced in May that year with the aim of moving China up the value chain.  At the same time, the country has continued to invest heavily in scientific research. Last year, 2.1 percent of its GDP, or 1.54 trillion yuan ($232 billion), was invested in R&D. Only the United States invested more. As a result of such financial inputs, the contribution of science and technology to economic growth has doubled over the past 10 years, and it now accounts for 56.2 percent. It is expected to reach 70 percent by 2020.  Despite all this, there remains a lot to do. The authorities cannot vacillate in their efforts to reduce red tape, protect intellectual property rights and push through reforms to improve the financial sector and research environment.  Also, crucially, as Premier Li Keqiang has said, the authorities must be willing and able to adapt, as the leading edge of the fourth industrial revolution has already proved to be the harbinger of rapid disruptions.  In the proposal for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), the first blueprint for development under Xi Jinping's presidency, the five principles considered necessary to ride this wave of the future were presented-innovation, coordination, green development, opening-up and inclusiveness.  The 19th National Congress of the CPC is expected to reaffirm these as integral to the pursuit of national rejuvenation.         "
Positive changes the defining feature of the past and future,10/10/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping speaks at the National Financial Work Conference in Beijing July 15, 2017.[Photo/Xinhua]      The Chinese Dream, proposed by Xi Jinping when he became general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in late 2012, has been the catchword for the country since then. It will continue to frame the agenda for the nation after the 19th CPC National Congress that begins later this month.  President Xi has emphasized the purpose of government is to protect and improve the lives of the people and the Chinese Dream serves as a clarion call for bringing real benefits to the Chinese people.  The first stage of this dream, building a moderately prosperous society, is to be attained by deepening reform and governing the nation according to the law, which requires strict governance of the Party.  As the other three goals would be impossible to realize without the rectitude of Party members, an anti-corruption campaign has been rigorously implemented, effectively curbing the rampant corruption within the Party and government that had previously accompanied the country's dramatic economic growth.  And in this regard, great achievements have been made. In the past five years, 140 officials at ministerial level or above have been either investigated or indicted, which indicates the central leadership's resolve to make everyone equal before the law and its bid to consolidate the Party's governing capabilities by ensuring the probity of officials.  With such needed change has come the better-than-expected performance of the country's economy over the past five years, much higher than the world's average, despite the headwinds of economic restructuring and the difficult external environment.  Last year, China's gross domestic product reached $11.2 trillion, accounting for 15 percent of the global total, 3 percentage points higher than that of 2012. From 2013 to 2016, China's economy contributed 30 percent to the world's economic growth, more than that of the eurozone, the United States and Japan combined.  That achievement has been the hallmark of resolve demonstrated by the country's leaders over the past five years to advance necessary economic and social reforms that have entered the deep-water stage.  There is a lot more that can be said about the progress that has been made over the past five years. But there is one word that encapsulates what the country and its people have experienced in that time-change.  Some have sought to ignore or belittle that change, but it is there nonetheless. And people here are aware of it, and feel its effects.  Some who benefited from the situation before change, and sought continuation of the existing status quo may have grudges or grievances. Yet, for most people, the change has been undeniably for the better and will be even more so in the near future.         "
Four US-China dialogues already proving their worth,10/9/2017,"                      That the relationship between China and the United States comes under strain from time to time is most often a result of one of them misinterpreting the other's intentions.  That is why the four high-level dialogue mechanisms, which were agreed during President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in April, are both pragmatic and important, as they can help the two sides avoid any misunderstandings by enabling them to properly discuss and manage their differences and disputes.  The last of the first round of dialogues-on law enforcement and cyber security-was held on Friday in Washington, with the two sides agreeing to further cooperate on repatriating suspected criminals, and to work together to combat drug trafficking and strengthen cyber security-outcomes that reflect the call of Xi last month for countries to jointly tackle transnational crimes and cyber security challenges and advance common and comprehensive security.  It is natural that China and the US do not see eye to eye on every issue. But so long as they take each other's major interests into account and keep the channels of communication open, there is no reason why they cannot forge a strong and friendly bilateral relationship.  For instance, one of the reasons the cyber security dialogue was initiated was the hacking attacks on US companies and government agencies, which, despite Beijing's consistent and strong denials of any involvement, Washington alleged were sponsored by China.  These accusations have long been an irritant in bilateral relations. However, the dialogue last week served to clarify the situation and help end the altercation, as both sides pledged to jointly crack down on cyber crimes and continue to implement their consensus on cyber security cooperation, including the agreement that neither side will conduct or support the cyber theft of intellectual property.  Likewise, the pledge of closer cooperation on repatriation will address China's concerns that the US could become a safe haven for corrupt Chinese officials who have fled the country.  It is heartening that such frank exchanges have been the hallmark of the first round of four dialogues between the US and China, since building a truly cooperative partnership between the two sides requires mutual trust and respect, and these can only be established by talking sincerely with one another to dispel misperceptions and suspicions. Addressing their concerns head-on in their talks will enable each to better understand the other's intentions.  And, after all, as President Xi put it, there are a thousand reasons to make the relationship work, and no reason to break it.         "
Reason must prevail during Tillerson's talks,9/29/2017,"                              Secretary of State Rex Tillerson holds a press briefing during the UN General Assembly in New York, US, Sept 20, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Symbolism matters on diplomatic occasions, and it will during the planned visit of US President Donald Trump to China later this year. Plenty of thought is no doubt being devoted to it, and plenty of endeavors will be underway to make sure his visit is successful, even fruitful.  However, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ongoing trip to Beijing must be anything but symbolic.        Rather than being a routine show of mutual goodwill to set the stage for Trump's visit, the guest and his hosts must avail themselves of their meetings to engage in candid communication to straighten at least one thing out-what each can expect from the other to ensure the situation on the Korean Peninsula does not deteriorate and spiral out of control.  Of course trade is important. It may actually be the foremost topic addressed during the meetings, particularly as fear of a potential trade war looms large on both sides of the Pacific. Mutual assurances are indispensable for averting that scenario.  But as long as both parties make room for some give-and-take on trade issues, Tillerson's talks will be of more immediate portent if they can take some of the heat out of the peninsula's inflammable nuclear crisis.  Both Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un appear jumpy these days. And the rest of the world seems to have grown increasingly blasé about this of late, even as the two leaders exchange vows of mutual destruction, few seem ready to believe their words should be taken seriously.  Perhaps; but that does not mean nothing will happen. The escalating exchanges of threats and insults pose an ever growing risk and they increase the chances of a costly miscalculation. That Pyongyang just took Trump's most recent threat to eliminate it as ""declaration of war"" may well show its existential concerns: It is unlikely it will make good on its threat to shoot down US bombers flying in international airspace, unless they threaten its survival.  Reason dictates that despite all the saber-rattling and verbal abuse, every party is well aware that war has to be avoided as the costs would be too great to bear.  The latest UN sanctions need time to begin to bite. On Thursday, China announced it has ordered DPRK enterprises operating on its soil to close within 120 days.  But to ensure that the worst-case outcome does not materialize, while further coordinating their stances on the implementation of the UN sanctions to make sure they work, Beijing and Washington also need to discuss what else they can do to resolve the peninsula crisis peacefully.         "
Discussions between China and US offer opportunities,9/27/2017,"                                             Frequent high-level consultations and dialogues have over the years proved an effective means for China and the United States to communicate and iron out their differences on a number of bilateral and international issues.  Considering that the two countries have different views on many issues, these high-profile contacts have helped facilitate better understanding of each other's intentions and enabled them to avoid any miscalculation or misstep.  Now, with bilateral trade frictions and their divergences over the best way to address the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear weapons program becoming more prominent, there is an urgent need for China and the US to step up such communication to narrow their divergences.  Thus it is both timely and welcome that Vice-Premier Liu Yandong, who is attending a series of cultural activities in the US this week, is scheduled to co-chair the first round of the China-US Social and Cultural Dialogue with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington on Thursday. And that Tillerson is scheduled to begin a three-day visit to Beijing the same day.  Just prior to his visit, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross discussed the pressing bilateral trade issues with Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Tuesday.  With each side having different priorities and issues of concern, there have been intimations of a coming trade war. But frank discussions will have hopefully fostered understanding and accommodation of each other’s position that will enable them to avoid such a harmful scenario.  Tillerson's visit will also enable the two sides to discuss ways to better coordinate their approaches toward Pyongyang's reckless ambition to pursue nuclear and missile capabilities, a pursuit that is pushing the situation on the peninsula toward tipping point.  Although Beijing and Washington have intensified their cooperation on the peninsula issue in recent months, it will of necessity again be to the fore in the discussions between Chinese leaders and Tillerson later this week, since any misjudgment of the situation would likely lead to a miscalculation that would have disastrous consequences.  As important players in attempts to resolve the issue, China and the US need to engineer a convergence in their approaches and jointly send a positive signal to the outside world that they are committed to easing the tensions through peaceful means.  And as long as the two countries bring to their discussions a willingness to foster a spirit of cooperation and talk candidly so as to find common ground, there is no reason why they cannot turn the process of addressing their differences into opportunities to deepen mutual trust and expand bilateral ties.         "
Combating security threats should be a common cause,9/27/2017,"                      In the keynote speech he delivered at the opening of the 86th General Assembly of International Criminal Police Organization held in Beijing on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping praised Interpol for the role it plays in maintaining world security and stability.  The meeting offered an opportunity for China to strengthen its cooperation with the international law enforcement organization, and Xi vowed to continuously extend China's support to the organization so it can play a bigger role in international law enforcement and global security governance.  Since its founding more than 90 years ago, Interpol's role in deepening international law enforcement cooperation and effectively tackling crime worldwide has become increasingly important as organized criminal activities have expanded across borders and nontraditional security threats have become more complex.  As evidence of this, Chinese police handled 2,542 investigative requests from foreign police forces that were transmitted via Interpol last year, up 140 percent from the year before.  In recognition of China's past support for the organization, Chinese Vice-Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei was elected president of the organization at Interpol's 85th General Assembly held in Bali, Indonesia, in November.  Given the global challenge of combating corruption, terrorism, cyber crimes, people trafficking, drug trafficking and money laundering, Xi's pledge of practical support will be of great value to enhance the effectiveness of international law enforcement efforts.  And considering the increasingly interconnected, cross-border and diversified nature of global security issues in the world today, people will understand why Xi stressed in his speech China's willingness to work with other countries and their law enforcement bodies to build a community of shared security.  It is China's belief that greater cooperation and strengthened efforts are also needed to ensure countries have the capability to fulfill that shared responsibility to fight transnational criminal activities and nontraditional security threats.  As Xi said, the diversity of such crimes and threats is becoming ever more prominent and no country is immune to them. Such a perception explains why China has made unremitting efforts to seek security cooperation with other countries and international organizations such as Interpol.  All countries should realize they share a common cause in fighting crime and promoting security, and they should strive to work together for the good of all.         "
Fourth term for Merkel reduces uncertainties,9/26/2017,"                              Christian Democratic Union CDU party leader and German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacts after winning the German general election (Bundestagswahl) in Berlin, Germany, September 24, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      With the world facing a lot of challenges and uncertainties, the re-election of Angela Merkel on Sunday will instill confidence and certainty in not just the European economy, but also global growth.  As the head of government for 12 consecutive years, Merkel has been a leading figure in guiding Germany, and Europe, through a turbulent period when one crisis has been followed by another, and while doing so, she has managed to ensure her country has been able to sustain its role as a locomotive of the global economy.  Although she has challenges to deal with at home, as shown by the rise in support for the AfD, her fourth term in office means a reassuring continuity in Germany's international policies, including its stance toward China.  Having visited China 10 times during her previous tenures, Merkel is well known for her cordial and close working relationships with Chinese leaders. So her re-election is being viewed as a boon for bilateral relations, as it is expected that she will seek to work with the Chinese leadership to inject new vitality into ties that are already in good shape.  The two sides have set a valuable example for ties between countries with different political and cultural backgrounds. Their strategic partnership was lifted to a comprehensive strategic one during President Xi Jinping's first state visit to Germany in 2014, and China became Germany's largest trading partner last year, while the latter has long been China's largest importer in Europe.  The world's second-and fourth-largest economies are also highly complementary and there is much potential still to be tapped. China's economic restructuring and booming market present many opportunities to German enterprises, while Germany's advanced facilities and managerial experience can help with China's ongoing industrial upgrading.  And as an astute and experienced political leader, it is expected that Merkel will oppose trade protectionism raising its ugly head in Germany and the rest of Europe, as well as the blocking of investments from China.  On the international front, China and Germany's resolve to expand their common interests will not only contribute in a favorable way to China-Europe relations, but also to global efforts to build a more just and balanced world, as both countries are staunch supporters of fairer globalization and international cooperation to address global challenges such as climate change.  As such, there is every reason for China and Germany to remain committed to ever deepening bilateral cooperation during Merkel's fourth term.         "
Property price controls boost financial stability,9/25/2017,"                              Visitors check out a property project at a housing fair in Luoyang, Central China's Henan province. [Photo Provided to China Daily]      A number of Chinese cities have extended or rolled out new measures to control property speculation, in a move that will help the country control its debt levels and maintain economic and financial stability.  Chongqing and six provincial capitals, such as Changsha of Hunan province and Shijiazhuang of Hebei province, have renewed their real estate price control measures prohibiting newly bought properties from being resold within a certain number of years, and some lower-tier cities have introduced similar measures to curb speculation.  Over the past decade, the country's property prices have soared despite price control measures. Speculative purchases have created a cycle of ever-escalating prices that has prompted more people to buy. As a result, this has pushed up prices encouraging even more speculative buying. In some major cities, such as Beijing, prices surged more than tenfold in many districts.  What's worse, this has led to potential buyers resorting to means such as cheating to obtain bank loans to buy properties, posing a threat to financial stability.  Thus despite China having a very high savings ratio and its economic fundamentals having improved significantly, and even though the authorities have made strenuous efforts to deleverage the economy since last year, the regulators are right to continue to take preemptive measures to curb the speculation in property so as to prevent the accumulation of financial risks.  The strict controls on speculative homebuying that have been implemented since last year, particularly in major cities where the easy credit has helped fuel soaring prices, have proved effective in curbing speculative purchases. In Beijing, for instance, more than 70 percent of new mortgages in the second quarter were extended to first-time homebuyers.  Still, some second-tier cities and smaller cities have failed to tame home prices, which rose at a two-digit pace in August year-on-year, so the latest sales-control measures are aimed at curbing property speculation in these cities.  But with property prices stabilizing, even falling, in most of major cities, as shown by the latest real estate price data for August, the planned interest rate hikes of the United States and its balance sheet contraction are attracting capital from emerging markets, leading to concerns it might trigger a sell-off of speculative property in China.  Thus the government needs to accelerate its proposed plan to establish a long-term mechanism, involving fiscal, tax, and legislative measures, to ensure the long-term stability of the real estate market as this will also help avert any future financial risks stemming from the property market.

US wrongly targets investment,9/22/2017,"                        As a report by the US Treasury Department confirmed on Wednesday, a growing number of Chinese bids to acquire US companies have fallen prey to US government reviews on the grounds of national security concerns.  The bid by Chinese-backed private equity company Canyon Bridge to buy US chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp was the latest to fall foul of such a claim, with the US president putting a stop to the deal despite the fact that Lattice has not had any business deals with the US military since 2012, according to Ray Bingham, a partner of Canyon Bridge.  The blocking of the deal has rightly aroused concerns about US protectionism and led some to say it is being ""penny wise, but pound foolish"".  It is the legitimate right of the US to properly review trade and investment deals to safeguard its national security, but that right should not be misused as a means to protect its industries, especially cutting-edge ones.  The increasing targeting of China-related investments may help partisan politicians win over unknowledgeable voters, but it disrupts normal business transactions, undermines international investor confidence, and seriously jeopardizes China-US trade and investment relations.  It is thus both shortsighted and self-harming for the US to target Chinese investments in this way, as it only backfires on itself.  Chinese investment in the US, which has been growing rapidly, helps boost the vitality of the US economy, creates jobs and boosts tax revenues.  Chinese-owned companies, for example, now employ more than 140,000 Americans nationwide, nine times as many as in 2009, according to the report by the National Committee on US-China Relations and Rhodium Group.  One company seeking to acquire another is a normal market practice, and a Chinese company's bid to acquire a US company should be treated objectively and fairly, like any other.  Politicizing Chinese investments for short-term interests makes neither economic nor political sense for the US in the long run.         "
Trump ought to know a deal must be honored,9/22/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, Sept 19, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      In his United Nations General Assembly speech on Tuesday, United States President Donald Trump called the Iran nuclear deal ""one of the worst"" agreements ever reached by Washington and ""an embarrassment"" to his country. ""We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,"" he said, renewing speculation that he may soon seek to withdraw the US from the deal.  Yet, since it was signed, Iran has been ""in technical compliance"" with the agreement, as confirmed by the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog.  Pulling the US out of the deal would not only erode the credibility of the US. It would also deal a heavy blow to the international nuclear non-proliferation drive, and set a bad precedent that would surely hamper the ongoing multinational efforts at finding a peaceful solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear deadlock through negotiations.  The 2015 accord to halt Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons is not a ""one-sided transaction"" as Trump claims. It was reached between Iran and a group of nations comprising Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the US after nearly two years of talks.  The deal they agreed drastically limits Iran's uranium stockpile and research and development and places the country's nuclear sites under UN inspection in return for the lifting of many US and European sanctions.  One of Trump's arguments is the ""sunset clause"" in the deal would see Iran resume some enrichment from 2025. But he forgets that diplomacy is an art that involves give and take, and the deal is a bargain that could not have been struck with a win-it-all mindset.  Trump may regard the deal as bad. He may harbor personal animosity toward Teheran. But his personal feelings are no reason for him to end the deal that was painstakingly worked out over the negotiation table.  If Washington dumped the deal that is ""delivering"" on its aims, it would be more than an embarrassment for his country; it would exacerbate Iran's misgivings about the US, send a signal to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that even if it was willing to talk, the US could not be trusted to honor any deal that was reached, and belie the US' self-touted commitment to a rule-based international order.  In his speech, Trump called on all nations to respect the rights of other nations. He should put those words into practice. Other nations have the right to expect the US to honor the agreements it has made. As US president, Trump should respect that right.         "
Timing of Lee's visit proves relations remain resilient,9/21/2017,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Beijing on Sept 20, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      To everyone concerned about the recent vicissitudes in China-Singapore relations, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's ongoing China visit, his first state visit since August 2013, is welcome, and it is being perceived as a sign that the soured bilateral ties are recovering.  After months of unease in their relations, the timing alone-before Lee's planned visit to the United States and the Communist Party of China's upcoming national congress-has bestowed Lee's visit with unusual symbolism, with many reading it as Singapore ""repositioning"" itself and recalibrating its strategic compass.  Singapore may have been seeking to try and weigh and balance relations with big countries, but a number of unpleasant episodes over the past year sowed rare discomfort between Beijing and Singapore. These began with Singapore urging China to accept the Manila-initiated international ""arbitration"" over the South China Sea dispute, which Beijing rejected as being illegal and invalid, and culminated in Lee's eye-catching absence from the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in May.  However, China-Singapore relations are resilient and they are able to weather such vicissitudes, in part due to the special thread of kinship between them-the majority of Singaporeans being of Chinese origin, a bond that determines a natural closeness.  And from a more utilitarian perspective, China is Singapore's largest trade partner and Singapore is China's largest source of foreign investment. Singapore has helped China tremendously in its pursuit of development. The joint venture programs Lee is visiting in Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, are fine examples of their fruitful partnership. And China's pro-globalization development initiatives, the Belt and Road in particular, will prove more than rewarding to Singapore should it choose to join in.  Singapore holds special significance to Chinese diplomacy not only because of its longstanding role as ""middleman"" between China and the West, but also because it is the current official coordinator of China-ASEAN relations, and will assume the presidency of ASEAN next year.  Right before coming to China, Lee said if overall relations are good, a steady stream of economic and trade cooperation projects will naturally ensue.  His visit is certainly helping to revive the two sides' previous strong rapport, and clearing the way for the said stream of mutually beneficial projects.  Yet although not widely reported, the fact is, high-level exchanges between the two sides have never stopped, and that, along with Lee's exchange of vows with his Chinese hosts to deepen political trust and upgrade economic cooperation, prove the foundations of bilateral ties are still sound and solid.

Trump's maiden UN speech full of sound and fury,9/20/2017,"                              United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (left) and US President Donald Trump pose for a photo prior to a high-level UN reform meeting at the UN headquarters in New York, Sept 18, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      United States President Donald Trump, in his maiden speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, was less forthcoming in his praise for the world body than his predecessor Barack Obama, indicating the US under his administration will pursue an all-for-itself approach that runs counter to the cooperative spirit of the world's foremost multilateral platform.  Trump was right that nations cannot remain bystanders given the common threats and challenges the world faces today, but cooperation cannot be shared self-interest, since for his administration that means a shared commitment to what is in the short-term interests of the US, rather than what is in the best long-term interests of all countries.  The pressing challenges the world faces today are not as the US misperceives threats to its hegemony, but rather poverty, epidemics, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and climate change.  What is needed is improved global governance, and the UN should be strengthened so that it can better fulfill its intended role in leading global efforts to address regional and international crises. Finger-pointing such as that indulged in by Trump will not help either of these processes and will only allow crises to ferment dangerously for an even longer time.  Trump called ""rogue nations"" the ""scourge of our planet"" and called on the UN to further isolate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But today's dangerous deadlock has been the result of Pyongyang's and Washington's persistent pursuit of their own interests in disregard of other countries' efforts to persuade the two antagonists to talk. His threat to ""totally destroy"" the DPRK if need be will, therefore, likely worsen the already volatile situation.  More needs to be done to improve the working style of the UN so that it can emerge from the shackles of bureaucracy and low efficiency, and better live up to its role as the defender of world peace and stability and the coordinator of nation-to-nation relations.  And in this time of ""immense promise and great peril"", Trump would have been better reflecting on how the US can more constructively engage with other countries, not just those that are willing to follow its lead. After all, since taking office in January, Trump has only exacerbated the confusion and uncertainty worldwide with his steady stream of contradictory tweets.  And he has withdrawn, or sought to pull out of, multilateral deals his country has signed before. From the Paris climate accord to the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump has demonstrated he is totally unconcerned about the US being good to its word.  Trump should accept that with great power comes great responsibility, and that as the world's sole superpower, the US has the responsibility to work with the rest of the world for the common good. History will show whether it is up to the task.         "
Seoul should recognize it is in same boat as Beijing,9/19/2017,"                              A Lotte Mart in Beijing, Feb 28, 2017. [Photo/China Daily]      The Republic of Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate Lotte Group announced on Friday that it will sell some of its Chinese stores, and could dispose of all of them; a move that is no more than recognition of a fait accompli since Lotte agreed in February to provide land for the installation of the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system in the ROK.  Following that decision, more than 80 percent of its hypermart stores in China have reportedly been closed, which has cost Lotte hundreds of millions of dollars.  Yet China can take no comfort in Lotte's business woes in the country, as the move serves neither side any good. For Lotte to exit the hypermarket business in China means it is abandoning a previously thriving market. Although the company's other businesses in China will continue to operate as before, its hypermarts have accounted for about 30 percent of the company's revenue in China, its largest overseas market. And the closure and sale of its stores means about 20,000 Chinese employed by Lotte will lose their jobs, as well as lost opportunities for hundreds of Chinese suppliers.  Lotte's announcement highlights the extent to which relations between the two countries have soured since former ROK president Park Geun-hye agreed to deploy THAAD on ROK soil.  Today, what prompted Lotte to make the decision to hand over its land to the ROK government to house the missile battery is no longer important. As tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to escalate, it is never too late for the political and business leaders in the ROK to reflect on the lessons to be learned from the Lotte case.  By rolling out the deployment of THAAD despite Beijing's repeated protestations, Seoul has willfully ignored Beijing's concerns due to its fears about Pyongyang's intentions and the pressure applied by Washington in pursuit of its own aims.  Although China has firmly opposed the installation of the THAAD anti-missile system in the ROK from the outset, it is actually in the same boat as the ROK.  There is no need for the relationship to be in the state it is in now, since both countries share the goal of making the region nuclear-free, peaceful and stable.  However, the US flew four F-35B stealth fighter jets and two B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula on Monday, which the ROK's defence ministry said was to ""demonstrate the deterrence capability of the US-South Korea alliance"". Yet Pyongyang is well aware of their military capabilities.  The ROK should reconsider its approach to its own security and instead of relying on the US, it should work to restore relations with China, as together they can work to ease the tensions that continue to dangerously escalate.

"Give sanctions time to bite, and leave door open to talks",9/18/2017,"                              Photo taken on Sept 11, 2017 shows the United Nations Security Council voting on a resolution on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at the UN headquarters in New York. UN Security Council on Monday imposed new sanctions on the DPRK over its latest nuclear test. [Photo/Xinhua]      Every time the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducts a nuclear test or missile launch, it is followed by a chorus of condemnation and a package of UN sanctions. Then everything goes back to ""normal"", with Pyongyang and Washington continuing their brinkmanship and the rest of the world helplessly looking on.  To ensure a peaceful Korean Peninsula that vicious circle must come to an end.  The UN Security Council has issued another strongly worded condemnation following Pyongyang's missile launch on Friday. But such rhetoric never works with the DPRK, whose leadership is seeking an ""equilibrium of real force with the US""-that being to its mind nuclear deterrence.  So the question being asked now is: Will sanctions make a difference?  If sanctions failed to prevent Pyongyang from conducting what it claims was a hydrogen bomb test on September 3, and launching a ballistic missile on Friday, will the latest sanctions bring the leaders in Pyongyang to their senses?  Some have simply accepted they will not, and are either calling for military action or else saying it is time the rest of the world began to learn to co-exist with a nuclear-armed DPRK. But the latter requires the international community forsake its current commitment to denuclearization and accommodate a provocative Pyongyang as a legitimate nuclear power, which looks anything but realistic.  In its latest statement, the UN Security Council displayed the unanimous belief that Pyongyang's nuclear/missile stunts are a threat to regional and global security. Beijing, through its ambassador to the US, stated hours after the missile launch on Friday that China would not accept the DPRK as a legitimate nuclear power.  Considering the unaffordable collateral damage of any military action against the DPRK, as well as the impossibility of dialogue at the moment-especially since Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, who favored engaging Pyongyang, has found dialogue ""impossible""-the most feasible approach is to let sanctions do the trick.  With its Friday missile launch, Pyongyang wanted to give the impression that sanctions will not work. Some people have fallen for that and immediately echoed the suggestion, pointing to the failure of past sanctions to achieve their purpose.  But that past sanctions did not work does not mean they will not. It is too early to claim failure because the latest sanctions have hardly begun to take effect. Giving the sanctions time to bite is the best way to make Pyongyang reconsider.  Priority No 1, therefore, is for the international community to work in unison so that the UN sanctions are implemented in full and work as intended, while leaving the door open to talks.         "
No room for HK separatism,9/18/2017,"                              Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents join a rally outside the Legislative Council complex to show support for the NPC Standing Committee's interpretation of the Basic Law on Nov 13, 2016. [Roy Liu /China Daily]      The Chief Secretary of Hong Kong, Matthew Cheung Kinchung, reiterated on Saturday that any advocacy of separatism, including that undertaken on university campuses, is unacceptable and an abuse of freedom of speech.  That the SAR government steadfastly condemns such activities is readily understandable since they violate the Basic Law, challenge the country's sovereignty, and threaten the special administrative region's fundamental interests.  As proved over the past two decades, the principle of ""one country, two systems"" has been the foundation for the SAR's economic prosperity and social stability, but this innovative framework is being endangered by the incessant endeavors of Hong Kong separatists.  The intent of ""one country, two systems"" was not only to maintain the city's prosperity but also to safeguard the nation's sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests. Advocacy of Hong Kong independence blatantly challenges the bottom line of such vital national interests. It simply will not be tolerated by the central government and the Chinese people, including the great majority of Hong Kong residents.  The attempt to defend the advocating of separatism under the guise of freedom of speech is nothing more than sophistry, and the SAR government is right to say there is no room for discussion on the issue and to endorse the statement jointly issued by the heads of 10 local universities on Friday condemning the raising of banners advocating ""Hong Kong independence"" on campuses as an abuse of free speech.  ""All universities undersigned agree that we do not support Hong Kong independence, which contravenes the Basic Law,"" the statement said.  The subsequent claim by those advocating separatism that this somehow restricts academic freedom was simply more sophistry.  Asked whether the government had put pressure on the universities, Cheung confirmed they acted autonomously and stressed that the message from the university heads was both clear and correct.  And that message is indisputable, as advocacy of separatism in the SAR is both illegal and unconstitutional.         "
Ignoring China's security issue not in ROK's interest,9/14/2017,"                                             With China's weeklong National Day holiday just around the corner, there has been speculation in the Republic of Korea on whether and how much its citizens can benefit from the tourist flow from China.  The October ""golden week"", an annual peak of outbound travel that continuously breaks sales records of related industries at home and in the main destination countries, had been a secure source of revenues for many ROK businesses for many years.  Even last year, when ties between Beijing and Seoul had already been strained by the latter's decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in total disregard of Beijing's security concerns and protests, tourist attractions and shopping venues in the ROK remained packed with Chinese visitors. During that one week, the ROK saw 250,000 visits by Chinese tourists, and many shopping venues registered double-digit growth in sales. So there were the claims that THAAD and souring official ties had no impact on tourist enthusiasm.  This coming National Day holiday, even more - 6 million as an industry study predicts - Chinese citizens are expected to travel abroad. But the ROK may not be among their top 10 most-favored destinations.  Obviously, this has to do with the overall relationship between the two countries, which has deteriorated inversely to the progress of THAAD deployment. Now that the entire THAAD is operational, it would be unrealistic to expect Beijing and Seoul rediscover their previous rapport any time soon. And as government-to-government ties worsen, they will inevitably spill over to undermine ties at the people-to-people level.  It does not take a government degree to stonewall things Korean. Chinese consumers can make their own decisions.  ROK businesses are correct in foreseeing they would miss China's ""golden week"" bus and lowering expectations. In fact, more, longer rainy days may be ahead for them as security concerns deepen the rift between Beijing and Seoul.  On the heels of its talk of embracing US ""strategic assets"" to counter threats from Pyongyang, the ROK military has more recently made public its intention to introduce the SM-3, or RIM-161 Standard Missile 3, a ship-based missile system known as a maritime version of THAAD. With the capability to intercept enemy missiles, even satellites, at higher altitudes, the SM-3 will further disturb the regional security balance and invite strong protests from neighboring countries. Corresponding information sharing with the US and Japan will inspire suspicion that the ROK has finally joined the US missile defense regime.  The ROK military appears fully aware of the damaging potentials. Its decision to go ahead displays an open disregard for China's security concerns, for which it will logically receive reciprocal responses. What their country loses then will certainly not be just Chinese tourist spending.                 "
A step toward ultimate shift to clean energy,9/13/2017,"                                                     Evening rush hour in Beijing. The city plans to cut the amount of cars through legalization. Photos Provided To China Daily    For those who are familiar with China's laws and efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, the document issued by 15 central ministerial departments that says gas mixed with ethanol will be used to fuel vehicles nationwide by 2020 should not come as a surprise, because it will facilitate the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy.    Ethanol mixed with gas, or ethanol gas, is being used in 11 provinces on a trial basis and research to develop better technology in this regard has been going on for years. Which means the decision to use ethanol gas to fuel vehicles across China by 2020 is based on what has already been achieved in developing the technology to produce the needed volume of ethanol and to promote the shift to clean energy.  Besides, studies are supposedly on to prepare a timetable for phasing out the manufacturing and sales of gas-powered vehicles in the future. The phase-out process is likely to be accompanied by a likely increase in the use of electric vehicles, which could take years because electric cars are expensive and there are too few charging points to meet the rising demand.  Before those goals are realized, however, the use of ethanol gas in vehicles could reduce harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.  China has about 200 million registered vehicles, and the greenhouse gases they emit are major contributors to air pollution. And it is to reduce these emissions that the government has been promoting new energy vehicles, by subsidizing their manufacturing costs and issuing favorable sales policies since 2010. That more than 1 million new-energy vehicles had been sold in China by the end of last year, making it the country with the highest number of such cars, speaks volumes of its green efforts.  In the first half of this year, China sold 123,000 electric vehicles, the most in the world and almost twice as many as the 64,000 in the United States, and it was also home to nine of the top 20 selling brands in the world.  The use of ethanol gas to fuel cars, therefore, should be seen as a phase that would pave the way to realizing the grander design of having only eco-friendly vehicles on China's roads. The shift to ethanol gas could also help China in upgrading its clean energy policy to meet the commitments it made at the 2015 Paris climate change conference and set an example for other countries to follow.                  "
Sanctions needed but are not the key to peace on peninsula,9/12/2017,"                                                     Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    The United Nations Security Council's unanimous decision on Monday to impose a new round of, and tougher, sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the international community's unswerving resolve to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program, and protect the nuclear non-proliferation regime.    By cutting the DPRK's overall oil supply by about 30 percent, banning all textile exports and prohibiting all countries from authorizing new work permits for the country's workers, the sanctions will certainly deal a blow to two key sources of finance for Pyongyang and may somewhat jolt its nuclear and missile program. But whether or not they will make the DPRK abandon its nuclear program is open to question.  That before the UN vote the DPRK declared the United States would face ""pain and suffering"", as it would retaliate if any new sanctions were imposed should reflect the Pyongyang's determination to press ahead with its ambitious and contentious nuclear program despite intense international pressure. Perhaps this is where the UN resolution, if taken in its entirety, can help, for it also calls for seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue through diplomatic and political means, taking measures to defuse tensions on the peninsula and making efforts to resume the Six-Party Talks.  If such efforts are indeed made, the DPRK is more likely to abide by the Security Council's resolutions, halt, if not abandon, its nuclear/missile program and return to the negotiation table.  The UN must have realized by now that sanctions alone cannot force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. The key to peace on the peninsula lies in making Pyongyang see the benefits of voluntarily giving up its nuclear program. But to bring Pyongyang even close to that point, the international community has to give some assurances, assurances it will honor: that the DPRK's national security will not be threatened by any country and its urgent development needs will be met.  China threw its weight behind the Security Council because it agrees that measures should be taken against Pyongyang in response to its sixth and strongest nuclear test on Sept 3. And given its support to international efforts to denuclearize the peninsula and safeguard peace and stability in the region, China has called for the comprehensive implementation of the UN resolution.  That Pyongyang should immediately stop its nuclear and missile tests and the opposing parties refrain from making any more provocative moves goes without saying. In the end, however, the DPRK can be convinced of the benefits of abandoning its nuclear pursuit only through talks, not threats and sanctions. And once the international community accepts this fact, it may find the road to peaceful negotiations a lot smoother.                  "
Merkel's offer a ray of hope,9/12/2017,"                              German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland February 7, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    Today even the most sanguine geopolitical analyst would have to concede the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis has reached the most critical, if not the most dangerous, stage. Despite years of international efforts to put a brake on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambitious nuclear program-through the Six-Party Talks or the many rounds of sanctions imposed by the United Nations and some countries-the country's nuclear and missile program seems close to completion.    Given these facts, new ideas and the involvement of new parties are needed to resolve the Korean Peninsula crisis.  It is thus welcome news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is ready to play a diplomatic mediator's role to help break the peninsula deadlock. In an interview with a German newspaper, published on Sunday, Merkel said: ""If our participation in talks is wanted, I will say yes immediately."" Merkel referred to the negotiations that led to Iran curtailing its nuclear program as a ""possible format"" for resolving the DPRK nuclear issue.  A week earlier Switzerland had offered to mediate between the rival parties, and on Friday China asked France to play a ""constructive role"" in helping ease the situation on the peninsula.  Merkel's suggestion echoes the rational voices in the international community that the DPRK nuclear issue should be resolved through peaceful consultations, and that war should never be an option. But for her ""format"" to work, Pyongyang and Washington, the two sides directly involved in the conflict, have to make some compromises.  Neither side has shown any signs of budging from its rigid stance, though. And the ""dual suspension"" proposed by China and Russiathe DPRK suspends its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the United States and the Republic of Korea suspending their joint military drills-seems to have fallen on deaf ears, and the vicious circle of rising tensions and increasing provocations continues.  But since Germany has no direct interest in the conflict, Merkel may be in a better position to help ease Pyongyang's existential worries, which have intensified due to the dramatic changes in the international situation after the end of the Cold War and decades of self-imposed isolation.  Although it is far too early to say whether Merkel's sedate diplomacy would help stabilize the Korean Peninsula, the efforts made by Germany, and other countries, in the pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the DPRK issue will help build mutual trust and reduce the chances of war. Any effort toward that goal is highly commendable.                  "
"Rhetoric, hatred can't help Trump win 'war on terror'",9/11/2017,"                                             Since his days on the campaign trail, defeating terrorism and destroying the Islamic State have been on US President Donald Trump's agenda as an outstanding foreign policy imperative. He attempted to push through a controversial, and widely resisted anti-Muslim travel ban. And he has been working on a new counter-terrorism strategy to put an end to what he deems a Barack Obama-era failure.  Sixteen years after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks prompted then US president George W. Bush to launch the ""war on terror"", the incumbent US president should have emerged a lot more knowledgeable about the mission. Because unless he refuses to face reality, he will realize the United States cannot win the fight alone, the ""war on terror"" alone is not enough to eliminate terrorism, and, most importantly, the US must engage both allies and past foes to complete the mission.  No matter how he evaluates the gains and losses of the Bush and Obama administrations, Trump should have realized by now that the matter is far more complicated than he had anticipated, or is willing to believe.  To be honest, he presented flashes of such realization during his visit to Saudi Arabia in May, as he chose his words carefully while addressing Muslim leaders, avoided using one of his pet terms, ""radical Islamic terrorism"", and stated that the fight against terrorism is not that between different beliefs or civilizations, but that between good and evil. Praising Islam as one of the greatest religions, he spoke the truth that 95 percent of the victims of terrorism have been innocent Muslims, which he had long ignored.  The biggest drawback in Trump's anti-terrorism campaign is the contradiction he is creating for himself. While he seems to have recognized the value of a broad global alliance to combat terrorism, he is simultaneously undermining it by alienating some key potential partners.  While it will take time for the international Muslim community to put aside Trump's previous anti-Muslim rant, his ongoing anti-Iran, anti-Russia moves are clearly counter-productive to building a global anti-terrorism front. His attempt to shift burdens to allies is not helping the cause either.  Moreover, the ""war on terror"" cannot be won on the battlefield. It must have the support of measures aimed at improving human rights, facilitating development, promoting good governance, and cleansing the soil that breeds hatred in communities considered hotbeds of terrorism.

Separatism has no place on or off Hong Kong campuses,9/10/2017,"                                             Separatists in Hong Kong have launched another propaganda campaign on university campuses with “pro-independence” posters and banners at the beginning of the new academic year, a move that has drawn citywide condemnation, from media commentaries to protest rallies.  “Pro-independence” cries through have flared again after a period of relative lull following the disqualification of six radical legislators and the imprisonment of a number of violent protestors and student activists. Which shows the fight against separatism is anything but over and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region needs to do everything to protect its youth against this potentially fatal disease that is linked to separatist forces in other parts of China, especially Taiwan.  The dramatic face-off last week between a mainland student who angrily tore down separatist posters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and local “pro-independence” students has triggered heated debates on and off campuses, reflecting how deep separatist forces have infiltrated most if not all student unions on university campuses, even some secondary schools.  It should surprise no one that the emergence of separatist forces followed the “color revolutions” and “coincided” with the “sunflower student movement” that helped the “pro-independence” Democratic Progressive Party win this year’s election in Taiwan.  Those still not convinced that separatist groups in Hong Kong have close links with their counterparts in Taiwan might have forgotten that a number of prominent radical opposition figures known for their anti-communist mentality have visited Taiwan multiple times in recent years to forge organizational ties with their “soul mates” and discuss ways how to secretly advance their hopeless cause of “independence”.  No matter what excuses they use for their separatist propaganda on SAR university campuses, such as academic independence and free speech, they cannot hide the obvious similarity between their choice of words and those of “Taiwan independence” advocates.  The SAR government has every reason to step up efforts to prevent separatists from spreading their tentacles in the city’s universities, colleges and schools because their actions violate Hong Kong’s Basic Law.  Some people may dismiss separatists’ activists in Hong Kong as negligible, but the SAR government and patriotic forces must not let their guard down for the simple reason that “pro-independence” forces apparently succeeded in brainwashing some youths, including college and middle school students. Which means not only the local administrations but also the educators have much work to do to “exorcise” those youths “possessed” by evil forces.         "
UN action along with talks is the way to solve DPRK issue,9/8/2017,"                              Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    The message was clear. As President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Donald Trump on the phone on Wednesday, China remains ""unswervingly committed to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and preserving the international nuclear nonproliferation regime"".    The message was crucial, too, because it came at a time when the international community is racking its brain over how to respond to Pyongyang's latest, and most serious, nuclear provocation.  The last thing Beijing wants to see is a war-and the subsequent chaos and refugee exodus-which, besides raising security and humanitarian concerns, would exact an unbearable cost on China's Northeast, which is already struggling economically.  That Xi reiterated the belief that a long-term solution lies in dialogue and a ""comprehensive"" approach was only logical. And by highlighting Beijing's commitment to denuclearization and nonproliferation, Xi made it clear a nuclear-armed, saber-rattling Democratic People's Republic of Korea is as unacceptable as a war.  Since the almost unavoidable heavy civilian toll a military approach is widely believed to result in has made forcefully disarming Pyongyang a non-option, non-military means remains the only agreeable way to reason with the DPRK, and draw all the parties to the negotiation table.  China and Russia have proposed an ideal short-term tension-defusing solution: ""dual suspension"", meaning the United States and the Republic of Korea suspend their joint military drills in exchange for the DPRK halting its nuclear and missile adventure. The proposal is important because the concerned parties' deep-rooted mutual distrust, especially Pyongyang's belief in nuclear deterrence, could escalate tensions further leading to the catastrophic, yet avoidable, worstcase scenario-a military conflict.  Strong protests from Beijing and Moscow failed to stop Seoul and Washington from deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK. Four more launchers were installed in the wee hours of Thursday. Now, Seoul and Tokyo are considering introducing more powerful US ""strategic assets"", tactical nuclear weapons included. Should this pattern of escalation perpetuate, the resultant arms race in Northeast Asia could spiral out of control.  Of course, more efforts should be made to discourage Pyongyang from making fresh trouble. But, as China said on Thursday, while the United Nations should take more action against the DPRK, it should also push for dialogue, even the revival of the Six-Party Talks.  Perhaps the failure of even the severest sanctions to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program suggests something the world seems to have missed: until the DPRK is assured there is no threat to its security, it will continue its, at times desperate, attempts to possess nuclear weapons as deterrence against the US. So, if the Six-Party Talks is the means to a long-term solution to the peninsula crisis, addressing the DPRK's security concern could be the start of that process.               "
US deficits prompt Trump to threaten global trade,9/7/2017,"                              Supporters wearing cowboy hats listen as US President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during a visit to Loren Cook Company in Springfield, Missouri, US, August 30, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    US President Donald Trump has raised a major political storm in both the United States and the Republic of Korea, its long-time ally, by threatening to terminate the bilateral free trade agreement. While making the statement, Trump, it appears, was not thinking about narrowing the $17 billion trade deficit the US has with the ROK. Rather, his is a desperate bid to rewrite existing global trade rules in favor of the US.    Ever earlier, Trump has threatened to withdraw from bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements. He has repeatedly threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement and clamored to use trade remedy measures to impose punitive tariffs on imports from major trade partners. He has ordered the Department of Commerce to investigate steel imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the imposition of tariffs on imports for national security reasons. And he has directed the US Trade Representative to launch an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into China's laws, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation.  The US' huge trade deficits are certainly behind Trump's threats to withdraw from free trade agreements. For example, the US had a trade deficit of $17 billion in goods and services combined with the ROK last year despite having a $10.7 billion trade surplus in services.  By issuing such threats, Trump can cater to those white industrial workers in the US who formed a bulk of his electorate in last year's presidential election, but by carrying out such isolationist ideas in practice, the Trump administration could drag the entire world into a trade war. It could even ruin the chances of increasing jobs and incomes in the US, a promise that in all probability won Trump the presidency, because other economies are set to fight back.  The plain economic truth is that global trade improves the wellbeing of people-not necessarily all groups of people, though-in all countries. In the case of the US, globalization might not have been good for the low-end industries, but it has greatly benefited the advanced manufacturing and services sectors.  This should prompt the US administration to make some policy changes so that it can help those traditionally weak industries to improve their competitiveness and flourish in the globalized world. By pursuing the ""America First"" policy and coercing other countries to help the US to rewrite the trade rules in its favor, the Trump administration will only evoke firm opposition from countries, even its allies, which would not be conducive to global trade.

Ineffective sanctions highlight need for talks,9/6/2017,"                              Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    That a new, knottier round of crisis would break out after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sunday was immediately clear, as was the fact it would not end any time soon.    With the dust the nuclear test raised and the verbal volleys of reactions it invited yet to settle down, come reports of Pyongyang preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile, which, needless to say, would further raise the hackles of the United States and Japan, and make Northeast Asia's security yet more uncertain.  What the US thinks about the DPRK found expression in its ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley's remarks. The DPRK leader ""was begging for war"", she said on Monday while urging the UN Security Council to impose the strongest sanctions possible on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear program.  The same day, US President Donald Trump told ROK President Moon Jae-in on the telephone that he would support ""in principle"" Seoul fitting its missiles with heavier warheads as deterrence against Pyongyang, while the ROK said it would clear the installation of four more batteries of the Thermal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile.  Such threats of war are the last thing China wants, not least because a war would end its decades of efforts to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula in devastation, which would serve no parties' interest.  Unfortunately, the other stakeholders seem to feel otherwise, as neither the US nor the DPRK is ready to budge from its position. If this vicious circle of US threats and DPRK provocations continues, the situation one day is bound to reach a tipping point. And if either side exhausts its patience and uses even a conventional weapon, the consequences of what would follow would be catastrophic.  It may already be late but not too late to give negotiations, sincere and serious, another chance. All the stakeholders, except perhaps the DPRK, want to denuclearize the peninsula. And perhaps none, certainly not China, wants a war. Why can't then all the stakeholders use these two factors as key to begin, at least, informal talks?  The US is worried that the DPRK is inching closer to possessing nuclear weapons. But the DPRK has reached that point to counter the perceived threats, including those from the US, to its security. If Pyongyang gets a sincere assurance that its security is no longer threatened, it might, as in the past, see some reason for taking part in talks.  Sanctions have not deterred Pyongyang from its quest, nor have military threats. China has been right about their ineffectiveness, and is almost certainly right about the effectiveness of negotiations.               "
Summit offers road map for building a fairer world order,9/5/2017,"                                    President Xi Jinping and other leaders of BRICS countries pose for a group photo before the Ninth BRICS Summit in Xiamen, in Southeast China's Fujian province, on Monday. The five leaders then took up many issues at the start of the event. WU ZHIYI / CHINA DAILY    On Sept 4, 2016, while addressing the 11th G20 Summit in Hangzhou, President Xi Jinping urged participating global leaders to make the grouping ""an action force, rather than a talking shop"".    On Sunday, at the Business Forum of the 9th BRICS Summit in Xiamen, Xi made the same reference, only this time he said BRICS is not a talking shop, but ""a task force that gets things done"".  The delicate contrast in rhetoric is a thought-provoking hallmark of what China, a relative newcomer to the stage of global governance, is seeking. From Xi's two major speeches before the release of the Xiamen Declaration and dozens of cooperation projects endorsed thereby, as well as ""BRICS Plus"" discussions, there is an explicit Chinese eagerness to maneuver actual changes the world desperately needs in these times of uncertainties.  Obviously, this aspiration is no longer China's alone, as it has been embraced by the other BRICS members as well, and the five emerging economies present in Xiamen under the ""BRICS Plus"" framework. It derives from a broadly felt imperative to address longstanding injustices in global governance, as the current world order is yet to acknowledge, let alone appreciate, the contribution of developing countries. But, as Xi stated, China and its BRICS partners have no intention of overthrowing the world order. They just want it to help make it fairer, democratic.  BRICS countries have their own troubles, at home and among themselves, which once prompted some to say the nascent grouping was losing luster. But despite that, the BRICS countries, thanks partly to intra-BRICS cooperation, have continued to outperform most of the rest of the world economically. What BRICS leaders agreed upon in Xiamen, including both framework documents and specific cooperative programs, can only consolidate such dynamism.  The ""BRICS Plus"" mechanism, which was introduced as a formal component of the annual event at Beijing's proposal, is a logical outreach commensurate with the grouping's ambition to make its own achievements deliver wider benefits. By engaging more emerging economies, which usually share extensive common interests in development-related areas, BRICS can indeed make global impacts, and build a stronger case against the anti-globalization trend in some economies.  At the threshold of a new BRICS decade, the Xiamen summit has come up with an inspiring road map for the member states. Whether BRICS can continue growing as it has done, however, rests heavily on how well its members honor their vow of solidarity.         "
US helping none in DPRK issue,9/5/2017,"                                              Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    US President Donald Trump's reaction to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's sixth nuclear test on Sunday stood out-not for its condemnation but for its twisted approach. Trump took to Twitter to say the DPRK ""is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success"". In his second tweet, he said the Republic of Korea ""is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with"" the DPRK ""will not work, they only understand one thing"".    He then called an emergency meeting of his national security advisers and had his second telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But he did not talk to ROK President Moon Jaein, accusing the ROK of ""appeasement"".  Condemning the DPRK for its nuclear and missile adventure is justified, but Trump is not helping the situation by criticizing the ROK and China. And China has not succeeded in its efforts, because the US has never heeded its advice on how to resolve the DPRK issue.  After the DPRK fired a missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, Trump said, ""all options are on the table"", a euphemism for military action. But his former chief strategist Steve Bannon had told The American Prospect earlier that ""there's no military solution, forget it"". Even US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have talked about the likely catastrophic outcome of military action.  And Moon, reacting to Trump's threat to the DPRK, said: ""No one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without the ROK's agreement.""  Although Pyongyang's latest nuclear test poses a serious challenge to Moon's strategy of inter-Korea dialogue, reconciliation and cooperation, Trump should have realized before criticizing Moon for his ""appeasement"" that sanctions have a worse record than talks.  Asserting that sanctions don't work, Robert Gallucci, chief US negotiator with Pyongyang during the Bill Clinton administration, said that during his contacts with DPRK officials, he realized they were fully aware of the cases of Iraq and Libya, where the US pursued regime change even after those countries had abandoned their attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.  That is something the US should focus on to ease the tensions not only on the Korean Peninsula, but also between Washington and Pyongyang.         "
What next after nuclear test?,9/4/2017,"                              Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea tested its sixth, and most powerful, thermonuclear device on Sunday despite all the warnings, sanctions and vows of ""extreme pressures"" to the contrary. Whether or not it was a hydrogen bomb with the destructive potential Pyongyang claims, the latest nuclear test indicates it has taken a big step in its pursuit of nuclear prowess.    The latest development, along with its previous claims of making progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and mid-and long-range ballistic missile technologies, if true, may indeed give Pyongyang the means to carry out its threats of launching doomsday attacks on enemy targets. Given Pyongyang's readiness to put to use each and every of its newly acquired capabilities against perceived enemies, this is a particularly dangerous move in its tactic of using nuclear and missile tests to draw attention to its demands.  Like on each past occasion, we have heard condemnations, warnings, threats of additional sanctions, and again, the talk of military options. But the same old question remains: how far can the stakeholders go in taking meaningful actions to rein in the DPRK's brinkmanship?  Year after year after year, the international community has been burdened by the contradiction between its shared interest in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and its inability to truly stand together when it comes to making efforts to truly make a difference. Which explains the vicious circle of escalation. We have looked on while the intervals between the DPRK's provocations have kept narrowing-it fired an alleged mid-range ballistic missile, over Japan, last week.  Judging from the trajectory of the DPRK's nuclear and missile adventure, Sunday's test will obviously not be its last show of defiance. For too long, stakeholding countries' rhetoric on their commitment to denuclearization has been offset by mutual distrust and finger-pointing among themselves, leaving ample space for the DPRK to continue its dangerous nuclear and missile programs.  It's high time, therefore, that the DPRK realized the devastating consequences of using that space to further its missile/nuclear programs and the stakeholders considered Pyongyang's genuine needs, especially food and national security, because whatever nonpublic concerns they may have, all the stakeholders share one genuine, and growing, concern: the threat those programs pose to them, the region and beyond. If they do not work together to check the DPRK now, they will find it increasingly difficult to do so as time passes by, because Pyongyang will not stop doing what it believes is safe to do.

[Photo/XINHUA]    BRICS should promote trade liberalization and an open world economy, and its member states-Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa-must explore ways to innovate economically. This, in gist, was the message of President Xi Jinping at the opening of the Business Forum of the three-day 9th BRICS Summit in Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, on Sunday.    And true to the theme, ""A Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future"", the leaders of the five member states attending the summit are committed to further strengthening their cooperation mechanism and making greater efforts to improve global governance. The five emerging economies will hold in-depth discussions on issues of common concern, including the world economy, global governance, international and regional issues, and national security and development.  The rest of the world is expected to pay close attention to the resolutions of the BRICS leaders to improve their decade-old mechanism, strengthen their cooperation, and better coordinate their development strategies on regional and international issues, because they are aimed at building a better world.  That the BRICS economies contributed more than half of global economic growth, however, is not enough. They should seize the opportunities offered by such global challenges as a sluggish world economic recovery and the trend of anti-globalization in some economies, and use their position as the world economy's strongest engine, to build a fairer global financial and trade system.  As Xi said, the development trend of BRICS remains unchanged despite the challenges its member states are facing, because one of the strongest aspects of BRICS is its global vision, meaning it is committed to bringing benefits to the people in not only the five countries but also the rest of the world.  The BRICS' spirit of openness, solidarity, equality, mutual understanding, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation marks a major departure from the West-led international relations of zero-sum game, and better reflects a multilateral world. As such, it will help build a more balanced and inclusive global economy.  Due to their different political and cultural backgrounds, the cooperation among BRICS members has not always been smooth. But, like Xi said, as long as they put greater faith in cooperation and keep building mutual trust, the road paved by BRICS can only strengthen their coordination and partnerships.  The Xiamen summit, therefore, looks set to usher in another ""golden decade"" for BRICS.                               "

Military adventure could lead Japan into own trap,9/1/2017,"                              Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe speaks at the Japan-US Economic Forum at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel, May 1, 2015, in Los Angeles. [Photo/Agencies]    Japan's Defense Ministry is seeking by far its highest budget for fiscal 2018 beginning next April, which, if approved, will be the sixth consecutive increase in the country's defense expenditure, reflecting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's penchant for military expansion. The proposed 2.5 percent hike will raise the budget to 5.26 trillion yen ($48 billion), which the ministry says is needed to pay for upgraded missile interceptors, six F-35 stealth fighters, four V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and new naval vessels, including a submarine and two compact warships.    A country constitutionally bound to maintain armed forces purely for defensive purposes certainly doesn't need such military equipment for national security, most of which anyway is provided by its military ally, the United States.  Yet Japan, under a bellicose Abe, has been setting one record after another not only in increasing military budgets but also in leading Japan on the dangerous path of militarism. Instead of sincerely reflecting upon Japan's wartime past and atoning for the atrocities the Japanese army committed before and during World War II, Abe has made every effort to revise Japan's pacifist Constitution, so that he can build a strong military.  To justify Abe's military expansion plans, many Japanese media outlets have accused China of posing a threat to Japan. They have used Japan's maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea as an excuse for the hikes in Japan's defense budgets, disregarding the fact that Tokyo was solely responsible for escalating the dispute.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, is high on Japan's blame list, and by test-firing a missile over Japan on Tuesday, Pyongyang seems to have played into the hands of Tokyo. The DPRK deserves the strongest condemnation for its provocative action, but it remains unclear as to how great a threat it poses to Japan. More importantly, countering a potential threat by building a bigger arsenal could lead to counterproductive and even dangerous outcomes, not only for Japan but also for the whole of Northeast Asia.  The current deadlock over the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue shows using military action as an option to resolve it will worsen and complicate the situation further. To salvage the situation, which seems to have reached a tipping point, the parties involved need to exercise strategic patience and establish communication.  But what Japan is doing, instead, could trigger an arms race, throwing the strategic equilibrium in the region off balance, setting alight the tinderbox that the peninsula has become.  Should such a scenario become reality, Japan will find the consequences of its military ambition almost impossible to swallow.               "
Strategic assets' plan will add fuel to peninsula fire,8/31/2017,"                              Democratic People's Republic of Korea launches a long range rocket launched into the air in this file still image taken from KRT video footage, released by Yonhap on February 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]    Reactions to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's latest provocation have followed the age-old script:    Pyongyang insisted it was exercising its legitimate right to ""self-defense"" by firing a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday. For the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan in particular, it was an exceedingly provocative gesture not seen in almost a decade. So much so that Japan activated its J-Alert system in northern areas, conducted drills to test its anti-ballistic missile system PAC-3; ROK President Moon Jae-in personally ordered live fire drills to exhibit his country's ""overwhelming"" fire power, with an officer counter-threatening the DPRK leadership with ""extermination""; and US President Donald Trump repeated his previous warning that ""all options are on the table"".  Despite the widespread condemnations, from the United Nations, Japan, the ROK, the US, China, Russia and other countries, the DPRK appears defiant as ever, threatening to fire more missiles into the Pacific.  The story has been unfolding exactly the same way as on each past occasion, and the outcome seems set to be the same: Pyongyang and its critics continuing wrangling over the chicken or the egg causality dilemma, with the former refusing to give up its nuclear pursuit and the latter remaining hopelessly divided over what to do.  If Pyongyang's latest provocation has exposed the helplessness of the international coalition against its nuclear and missile programs, the worse may be yet to come.  One fundamental reason for the international community's inability to curb the DPRK's dangerous adventure has been the contradictory agendas of those that ostensibly have shared interest in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. If the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is the first wedge driving the fragile coalition apart, another, more damaging one seems on its way as Seoul and Washington reportedly engage in talks on deploying additional ""strategic assets"" on the ROK's soil. Seoul has already confirmed corresponding talks between ROK and US militaries.  Pyongyang's continuous provocations may serve as a catalyst for the potential deployment of additional but controversial and divisive ""strategic assets"". But like THAAD, US strategic weapons can do little to prevent the feared civilian losses when a war with the DPRK breaks out. However, they can seriously undermine the precious, though already weak, global consensus on the denuclearization of the peninsula, as combined with THAAD, they will constitute a potential, substantial threat to Chinese and Russian national security, and inevitably invite strong reactions from both.  When that day comes, Pyongyang's nuclear/missile programs may turn out to be of secondary concern to the world.               "
"Peninsula needs cooperation, not missiles, to restore peace",8/30/2017,"                              Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Hwasong-14 is pictured during its second test-fire in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on July 29, 2017. KCNA via Agencies    Just three days after the abortive launch of a number of unspecified projectiles, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fired what was believed to be a ballistic missile that flew over Japan on Tuesday morning, prompting an emergency phone call between Japanese and US leaders that ended with a vow to put more pressure on Pyongyang.    Whatever be its intended message, Pyongyang's latest provocation is in clear violation of United Nations resolutions, which could put it in a more difficult position.  It will not be easy to reason Pyongyang out of its nuclear and missile programs, especially because the DPRK, of late, has been reiterating it must press ahead with them at all costs. Divergences among stakeholding countries have given the DPRK ample breathing space to continue its nuclear/missile adventure. Pyongyang obviously believes that will not change.  But Pyongyang would commit a grave mistake by refusing to see that each of its new provocations is alienating it further from the international community. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions aimed at nullifying the DPRK's nuclear/missile adventure because it perceives in it a big threat. The latest, Resolution 2371, which imposes the harshest sanctions on the DPRK, indicates a higher level of consensus on that threat.  However, it would be unfair to dump all the blame on Pyongyang alone. Washington, Tokyo and Seoul each has its own fair share in creating what Pyongyang sees as a threat to its very existence.  Beijing has been consistent in calling for due respect for Pyongyang's security concerns, and for the US-Japan-ROK alliance to provoke the DPRK no further. It has rightly called for ""dual suspension""-Pyongyang suspends its nuclear/missile activities while Washington and Seoul suspend their large-scale military drills- to break the deadlock, which none of the three has responded to.  But Beijing's latest warning that tensions on the Korean Peninsula have reached ""tipping point"" should not be taken as one meant just for Washington and its allies-Pyongyang deserves no cover for continuing to throw cold water on the international community's efforts to denuclearize the peninsula.  Considering the longstanding, unchanged script of the protracted drama, the ""tipping point"" may not necessarily materialize any time soon. More likely than not, a short interval of relative ease will follow, until Pyongyang launches another ballistic missile, or conducts another nuclear test.  The international community may remain helpless while Pyongyang steadily strengthens its capabilities, but Pyongyang will find the screw of sanctions tightening- until the threat gets too real, too devastating to be tolerated, or the sanctions too severe to endure.

US ignores its warships pose major threat to other vessels,8/29/2017,"                              Fang Jianping | China Daily     In an apparent bid to quell Western concerns over a series of accidents involving US naval vessels, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the US Pacific Air Forces commander, insisted the US ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea have not suffered a setback and the US military will continue them to combat China's territorial claims.    These remarks expose the US' hegemonic mentality: Never admit you have done something wrong, put the blame on others.  The USS John S. McCain was the latest US vessel to collide-with a tanker off Singapore on Aug 21-in what was the fourth accident involving a US naval warship in the Pacific this year. Media reports said the 10 missing sailors were confirmed dead after their bodies were found on Monday. Together with the collision of the USS Fitzgerald in mid-June, which left seven US sailors dead, the US Navy has lost 17 personnel, compared with the 11 US soldiers killed in Afghanistan so far this year.  Judging by these figures alone, what the US claims to be ""freedom of navigation"" operations for peaceful purposes have become far more dangerous for the US military than fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US should rethink its ""freedom of navigation"" policy for the safety of its military personnel, if not for anything else.  Yet O'Shaughnessy's remarks show the United States prefers to stick to its hegemonic mentality.  The Barack Obama administration ordered several ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea, using the maritime disputes involving China and some Southeast Asian countries as an excuse to interfere in regional affairs. The Donald Trump administration is continuing that practice, perhaps because it perceives the so-called freedom of navigation operations as a major US strategy to check China's influence in the region. But the reckless behavior of US naval vessel commanders have helped people to see through the US' dangerous strategic games.  Instead of defending the so-called freedom of navigation, US naval vessels sailing in the South China Sea have become moving threats to other ships. And their frequent and unannounced presence in the waters should make the international community realize it is the US Navy that is militarizing the waters.  But instead of urging the US to rethink its strategy, some Western journalists have hinted that cyberattacks, orchestrated by China, could have led to the accidents involving the US warships. Are these journalists trying to prevent the US Navy from thoroughly investigating the accidents because they fear that it would reveal the dirty truths?  And if the US believes in such preposterous ideas, its naval vessels will continue to pose a threat to not only other ships but also its own military personnel.               "
India stands to face retribution,8/28/2017,"                              China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday that India should refrain from abusing trade remedy measures, which would disrupt economic cooperation and trade relations between the two countries.[Photo/mofcom.gov.cn]    India has started building a road near Bangong Lake in Ladakh, which, according to Indian media, will facilitate the movement of Indian troops. This suggests India might be preparing for a war with China, or pretending to go to war in the hope of forcing China into making concessions.    Indian troops trespassed into China's territory in the Donglang area more than two months ago to stop Chinese troops from building a road in its own territory, claiming the road would pose a threat to India's security. Why doesn't the Indian government apply the same logic to understand that by building a road near the disputed border area with China, India will pose a threat to its neighbor's national security?  Whether India has the economic and military wherewithal to become a hegemon is still uncertain, but it indeed is behaving like one considering its decision to send its troops into Chinese territory by assuming it is Bhutan's protector and its insistence of keeping them there leading to the more than two-month-long standoff with Chinese troops.  India claims to be acting on behalf of Bhutan, but many in Bhutan feel India's protective embrace has become suffocating, according to a report in The New York Times. Pema Gyamtsho, a leader of the opposition party in Bhutan's National Assembly, was quoted as saying that in the case of a war between India and China, Bhutan would become the meat in the sandwich.  Instead of safeguarding Bhutan's national security, India is actually bullying the tiny country, as Bhutan doesn't seem to have sought India's help. As such, India is taking advantage of Bhutan, in order to assert itself as a regional superpower.  And in doing so, India is punching above its weight, perhaps because it believes China will do whatever it can to avoid a military conflict with India. India's decision-makers may be complacent in the belief that they have made the right decision given China's tolerance and repeated warnings over the past more than two months.  But if India continues to think so, it cannot escape the retribution it deserves for what it has done. It's only a matter of time.            "
Biased Western media get HK judiciary facts wrong,8/28/2017,"                              Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor (second right) and her husband Lam Siu-por (third right) greet the public before the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at Golden Bauhinia Square on Saturday. [Photo/INFORMATION SERVICES DEPARTMENT]    In an attempt to defend Hong Kong's judiciary from vicious, unjust attacks, particularly from the biased Western media, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, reemphasized the vibrancy of the SAR's judicial independence on Saturday.    Without any basis or evidence, some Western media outlets and politicians, including a couple of US Congress members, joined a chorus last week to accuse Beijing of meddling in a Hong Kong court case, in which three young activists were imprisoned.  There is nothing new or unusual about such accusations, as some Western media outlets and politicians are known to harbor hostility toward China. And they hardly let slip an opportunity to soil Beijing's reputation.  But they were barking up the wrong tree when they attacked Hong Kong's judiciary and questioned its independence after the city's Court of Appeal sentenced Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Alex Chow Yong-kang to imprisonment of between six and eight months for offenses related to unlawful assembly.  The imprisonment of the three reflects ""the voice of Beijing, not of justice"", The Guardian said in an editorial. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, in a letter to Financial Times, said the three activists' imprisonment is ""a further example of Beijing tightening its grip on Hong Kong's aspiration to remain a free society"". And a Financial Times' commentator claimed Beijing is ""clearly retreating from the commitments ... to guarantee free speech, press and assembly"" for Hong Kong residents.  But the accusatory voices were silenced by the swift response from the SAR's judiciary, the Bar Association and Law Society of Hong Kong, which issued a rare joint statement condemning the ""unfounded criticism"" by ""some local and international media"". The two legal professional bodies, which together represent all the city's lawyers and have fought for judicial independence, said the judges handled the case strictly based on established legal principles and procedures, and all the defendants were given proper legal representation.  Indeed, the slanderers are guilty of pretending to be unaware of the independence and quality of Hong Kong's judiciary. The city's judicial independence is ranked eighth globally by the World Economic Forum, well ahead of the United States (29th). And the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, which measures people's experience and perception about the rule of law across the world, placed Hong Kong at 16th among 113 jurisdictions on its 2016 list-ahead of ""big democracies"" such as the US (18), France (21) and Italy (35).  Of course, facts will eventually scotch the lies. But that does not spare us the obligation to set the record straight.               "
Hopes of peninsula thaw need kindling with actions,8/25/2017,"                              South Korean President Moon Jae-In speaks during a press conference marking his first 100 days in office at the presidential house in Seoul on August 17, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    ""If winter comes, can spring be far behind?""    For two centuries, that famous line by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley has offered numerous people in despair the hope that the dark hours will pass.  It may also have been on the mind of Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday, when he urged his country's Ministry of Unification to prepare for a thaw in relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Like the freezing chill of winter never halts the footsteps of spring, the more difficult the situation gets, the harder the ROK should try to ease tensions with the DPRK, Moon said. Placing the tense standoff on the Korean Peninsula in the dead of winter, Moon reiterated his belief that a thaw will eventually come.  Great statesmanship no doubt requires some clinging to idealism-the capability to retain and kindle the small flame of hope and to envisage a brighter prospect that lies beyond sight.  The ROK president obviously still has some, considering his undampened enthusiasm for engaging Pyongyang, and his conviction there will be a peaceful conclusion to the DPRK crisis.  Yet unlike the natural inevitability of the cycle of seasons, there is no certainty that bad will turn to good in real-world situations. Depending on the concerned parties' actions or inactions, the current stalemate could go either way.  Despite all the high-decibel threats of mutual destruction and actual saber-rattling, both sides have been careful not to shut the door to dialogue. Both keep signaling willingness to talk, although setting preconditions they know are unlikely to be met.  Perhaps President Moon has been reviewing the past to justify his hopes in a coming spring.  Following a DPRK missile test and suspected nuclear activities in 1998, US special envoy William Perry led a comprehensive process of regional consultation and coordination that once brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. And the joint statement made on 19 September 2005 following the second phase of the Six-Party Talks that year established a basic framework for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  But if those remarkable headways did not suffice to make a lasting difference, President Moon's good wishes hardly will. Moon's adherence to engagement is to be admired. But it will prove meaningless without the support of corresponding moves that truly de-escalate tensions.  While its joint military drills with the US continue irking Pyongyang, the ROK's deployment of the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is alienating other members of the international community trying to denuclearize the peninsula.  Should this pattern persist, the winter President Moon foretells ending may instead prove a long one.               "
ROK can revive ties by reversing THAAD decision,8/24/2017,"                             Protesters hold a rally against the deployment of the US missile defense system in Seoul on Saturday.Yao Qilin / Xinhua      Thursday marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea, an occasion that should have been observed with lots of fanfare and the extending of mutual best wishes.        That such high-profile celebrations are conspicuous by their absence can be attributed to the deployment of the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK, which put a brake on the development of the hard-won strategic cooperative partnership, and then thrust it into reverse.  Despite Beijing's firm opposition to the ROK's deployment of THAAD given its potential damage to the regional strategic balance and China's security interests-as well as the doubts about the system's ability to achieve its stated purpose of defending the ROK should it come under attack from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-the recently installed ROK President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial missile defense system late last month after the DPRK's most recent missile test.  The move dashed the hopes which arose when he took office in May that he would postpone the system's deployment in the ROK pending an environmental review. It was anticipated that this would improve the deteriorating Sino-ROK relations, by giving the two neighbors time to sort out their differences and find a common approach to easing the growing tensions in the region.  For relations shouldn't be like this. In the face of the escalating brinkmanship between the US and the DPRK, Beijing and Seoul are both on the same page in wanting the Korean Peninsula to be nuclear free, and both believe war is not an option. Just last week, Moon said he was considering sending a special envoy to the DPRK for talks in a bid to jump-start diplomacy.  The ROK's security concerns are genuine, but they would be better addressed by not estranging China, and the two countries working closely together to promote peace and stability on the peninsula.  The ROK should not let its fears that it is in the DPRK's cross hairs betray its judgment. Hanging on to the coattails of the US, which has its own aims in the region, merely increases the likelihood of those fears coming true.  Twenty-five years ago, the leaders of China and the ROK, guided by their wisdom, and displaying courage and vision, beat all odds and decades of hostility to forge a friendly relationship that has benefited the two nations tremendously and contributed to peace, security and prosperity in the region.  Seoul should display similar wisdom and vision now.         "
Military efforts alone will not end US' longest war,8/23/2017,"                           While not forgetting to continue lambasting his immediate predecessor for what he did regarding Afghanistan, the sitting US president has actually followed in his predecessor's footprints by choosing to boost the United States' military presence there.  This, as he conceded, goes against his original instinct to pull out. And his vow on the campaign trail, when he said the US' presence in Afghanistan was sheer ""nonsense"".  Yet Donald Trump eating his own words may not be that bad in this instance. That the US president has opted to defy his own instincts and embrace a move he would have vehemently refused to make earlier in his presidency is a precious bow to reason. This, along with the recent ousting of Steve Bannon, whose controversial orientations sowed too much tension on too many fronts, gives the impression that Trump is learning the ropes. At least he is coming to terms with the cruel reality in Afghanistan that Obama was concerned about, and the dire consequences of ""a hasty withdrawal"".  Although George W. Bush, who launched the ""war on terror"" in retaliation for the terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, declared ""mission accomplished"" two years later, the war is still far from over, not least in Afghanistan.  Trump's latest idea of seeking Afghan, Indian, NATO and Pakistani assistance in fulfilling the US' goals there is a rare awareness of the limitations of US capabilities and the value of international partnerships. Only it will be quite another thing to get Pakistan's cooperation via the unprecedented pressure he promised, or to convince NATO allies to send more troops, and India to help economically.  Even if he manages to assemble the international coalition he aspires to, Trump may still not succeed where both Bush and Obama failed, because military intervention alone will not do the trick. And he has no intention of going beyond that. ""We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists,"" he said.  While China welcomes efforts to improve the security situation in Afghanistan and hopes the US policy will help to achieve that and promote stability, it has steadfastly called for national reconciliation and development to be advanced at the same time.  Overwhelming US military prowess may stop terrorist resurgence and deny terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction. However, even if it is against President Trump's wishes, unless the US presence in Afghanistan proves conducive to the war-torn country's process of nation building and addressing the problems of anarchy, poverty and factional strife, the day may never come when Washington can assuredly claim the war is won.

No laments if presidency Bannon fought for is over,8/21/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump (L-R), joined by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisor Steve Bannon, Communications Director Sean Spicer and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, speaks by phone with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, US on January 28, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      There are many reasons for concerned Americans and the rest of the world to heave sighs of relief at Steve Bannon's departure from the White House.        His removal is conducive to both curing the ideological rift at home and appeasing international anxiety over the United States' policy orientations.  Bannon was the man who helped Donald Trump get into the White House, although President Trump has been reluctant to give him full credit.  He was allegedly behind many of the controversial policies introduced by Trump, from the anti-Muslim travel ban to the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.  He was deemed the mastermind of the Trump administration's populist, nationalist policy framework, which has put the US at odds with even its allies.  And in China, Bannon is notorious for his pre-White House clamor about a war with China in the South China Sea, as well as the latest call for the US to be ""maniacally focused"" on an ""economic war with China"", which he said is ""everything"" to him.  But his going will hardly be the ""turning point"" some optimists want to see in US foreign policies, especially its China policies. Firing Bannon may just be a political sacrifice that had to be made in the face of a dissatisfied home audience. Aside from some remarks that were at most embarrassing to Trump, there is no sign the two have parted ways on the fundamental issue of direction.  It is an ironic coincidence that the same day Bannon got the axe, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declared a probe was being launched into Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of a 1974 law.  Whether or not the announcement was a farewell gift for Bannon the self-labeled ""economic nationalist"", as some have speculated, it should at least be a reminder that the dark clouds of a potential trade war are not going anywhere even with the hawkish Bannon gone.  Since the opening shot has been fired, our best hope of averting the trade war Bannon has been after is US investigators and the negotiators of both countries demonstrate reason and transcend prejudices. Because there will be no winner in the kind of tit-for-tat battle he covets.  The messy state of affairs facing the Trump administration, at home and abroad, is telling proof of the failure of the radical approach Bannon adopted on real-world issues. There is nothing to lament if the Trump presidency Bannon had fought for is over. The US needs a different Trump presidency. So does the rest of the world.         "
"Beijing, Manila show the way to sea of tranquility",8/18/2017,"                                     Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, accompanied by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, is greeted at Beijing Capital International Airport at the start of his fourday state visit on Oct 18, 2016. HE XIAOHUI / FOR CHINA DAILY         One needs to look no further back than a couple of years ago, when China and the Philippines were deeply mired in distrust and rancor, to appreciate how territorial disputes improperly handled can become a major source of antagonism between countries.  But likewise, looking back over the last nine months or so and tracing the improvement in their relations, it is evident that territorial disputes, if handled with care, do not have to be an obstacle to friendly ties and mutually beneficial cooperation.  Of course, what has reversed the polarity of relations is not simply good fortune but their mutual efforts and concrete actions to realize their shared resolve to escape the dangerous current souring their relations and to work together for a friendly future.  Hence, it is good to see China and the Philippines are seriously mulling energy cooperation in the South China Sea, which was the venue for contention between the two countries until June last year under former Philippine president Benigno Aquino III.  According to Philippine media reports, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said at a news conference in Manila on Wednesday that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has already given the green light to the Philippines jointly exploiting oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea with China.  Moving forward with energy cooperation in the South China Sea, which was also endorsed by Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a trip to Manila last month, sends a positive signal that the two countries have found a way to manage their territorial disputes.  The good momentum in China-Philippines ties caters to the interests of both countries and does a power of good to the region as a whole by setting a good example for other countries on how to properly manage differences. As long as countries adopt a constructive approach, there is no reason why the disputes should threaten peace and stability in the region.  China has long proposed that countries shelve their differences and jointly exploit the resources in the South China Sea. But over the years, China's suggestion has largely fallen on deaf ears while a few countries have competed with each other to drill for oil and gas in disputed areas, which has only served to ratchet up tensions.  The deepened cooperation between China and the Philippines not only paves the way for a final settlement of their disputes but also opens the door to establishing the South China Sea as a sea of peace, a sea of friendship and a sea of cooperation.

Agreement sign of shared resolve to reduce risks,8/17/2017,"                              A $100 banknote is placed next to 100 yuan banknotes in this October 16, 2010 file picture illustration taken in Beijing. [Photo/Agencies]    The agreement signed in Beijing on Tuesday to improve communication, relations and exchanges between the militaries of China and the United States is a significant effort to manage the differences between them and avoid miscalculations.    Since Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who signed the agreement with his Chinese counterpart Fang Fenghui, said that both militaries have many issues on which they don't necessarily share the same perspective, such an agreement is clearly necessary.  While it is natural for China and the US to have differences in many areas, there is no reason their differences should stand in the way of efforts to develop better bilateral ties unless one side keeps pushing the envelope to find the other's bottom line, and thus risk crossing it.  Which is something the US military has been doing with its so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea since former US president Barack Obama initiated his strategy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific.  China does not hinder freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and it has no intention of doing so. Nor does it harbor the ambition to bully any country with its military might. Which explains why China seeks to resolve its territorial disputes in the South China Sea through direct negotiations with the countries concerned, and why time and again it has proposed shelving the disputes and jointly exploring and exploiting the resources in the South China Sea with its neighbors.  But its peaceful intentions do not mean China will tolerate the intrusion of foreign warships into its waters in the name of freedom of navigation, something China regards as a lack of respect for its core interests. Which is why it is adopting countermeasures. It would be against its interests for China to accept such a military intrusion as normal or acquiesce to the deception that it is in defense of freedom of navigation.  Given the fact that China-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world, whether both militaries can avoid misunderstandings is of utmost importance not just to themselves but also the world.  That is why the agreement is to be welcomed as it may facilitate better communication and increase trust between the two militaries so they can avert a miscalculation.  It is now imperative that both sides make efforts to build the planned communication mechanism for their joint staff departments on the basis of the agreement so they can better deliver on their shared commitment to reduce risks.

Abe still driving wedge between Japan and China,8/16/2017,"                              Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gestures during a press conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 21, 2016. [Agencies]    Over the past five years, the world has waited and hoped for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to acknowledge the truth in his perception of history. However, he has constantly let the world down.    He did so again on Tuesday, when, at a national memorial service to mark the 72nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, he once again shied away from Japan's wartime atrocities and failed to mention that he had ""reflected"" on his country's past aggression that brought untold suffering to Asian countries such as China and the Republic of Korea. Neither did he pledge his country will not engage in war again.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese during their occupation of Asian countries are irrefutable. Much as they would like to bury them, the historical truths are well evidenced and documented. Any attempt by Japanese leaders to whitewash or even deny that part of history is an open defiance to peace-loving people around the world.  If Abe continues to pretend that Japan's past aggression never happened, he will only reinforce his image as a politician willing stoop to any level, no matter how low, to realize his ambitions for Japan to play a bigger role in regional and world affairs.  The deceitful paramnesia displayed by Abe and like-minded Japanese makes a mockery of this aspiration, and it is simply helping to cultivate a national image that is at odds with their assertions that Japan is a peace-loving country.  Abe and his right-wing followers in Japan know well their repeated denial of historical truths have reopened wounds that had begun to heal. Their unwillingness to face up to the truths of history has soured Japan's relations with China and the ROK, and is pulling Japan further apart from them.  It is no exaggeration to say the past five years have been among the darkest days in Sino-Japanese ties since the two established formal diplomatic ties.  And Abe is painting the picture even darker by stubbornly refusing to listen to reason and adamantly leading Japan in the wrong direction.  Abe has nothing to lose by changing tack and helping Japan lay down the burden of history; indeed, his country has much to gain as he would create the opportunity to reset Sino-Japanese ties.  The door for putting China-Japan relations back onto a normal track remains open, Japan has to reflect sincerely upon history and face up to its past.                  "
Sickness in US society will not be easy to cure,8/15/2017,"                              Members of white nationalists clash against a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, US, August 12, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    For a long time, people in the United States took pride in the belief that one of the things that made their nation great was a system that was designed to encourage principled disagreements so that people could achieve consensus through reasoned debate.    ""I disapprove of what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it,"" as French philosopher Voltaire put it.  Yet their faith in that system seems to have wavered in recent years amid the widening social, racial and political divides in the country.  Divides that fester with animosity, as shown by the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, when a man plowed a car into a crowd of people protesting against a rally by white supremacists, killing one person and injuring 19, and bloody street brawls erupted injuring more.  While violence, bigotry and hatred in any form must be condemned, it is also imperative to identify the root cause of all these problems because they show something is wrong with US society.  Some people in the US have pointed an accusing finger at President Donald Trump, who they say is to blame for what they believe is his incitement of intolerance for his own political gains, citing his anti-immigrant and misogynist campaign rhetoric as proof.  That is why Trump has been widely criticized for his failure to explicitly condemn the white supremacists for their part in the weekend violence, unlike Vice-President Mike Pence, who stated bluntly that he had no tolerance for white supremacists or neo-Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan.  Yet it would be oversimplifying the facts to attribute all the social problems in the US to a single person or certain groups. US society was polarized before Trump took office.  This is a society where 1 percent of the people have nearly 40 percent of the national wealth, prompting the quip that it is ""of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent and for the 1 percent"".  The Virginia violence is just one symptom of a social system that is afflicted with a severe sickness.  People may differ over what has gone wrong in the system, but there is no denying that the strength on which the United States built its success, a widely shared belief in the American dream and what made it great, is no longer there.  There is no easy cure to remedy the wrongs in US society. But to start with, a little soul-searching may be a step in the right direction.               "
India shooting itself in the foot,8/14/2017,"                              A Foreign Ministry photo released shows Indian troops encroaching on Chinese territory. Provided to China Daily     By persistently maintaining the standoff between its troops trespassing in China's territory and the Chinese troops stationed there, what does India want, a war with China or something else?    By calling on India to withdraw its troops and warning it time and again about the serious consequences it will face, China has given it an inch but India wants to take a mile, not only by turning a deaf ear to the repeated warnings but also by increasing its military presence along that section of the delimited border.  The Press Trust of India quoted an unnamed government official as saying that the ""caution level"" among the troops has also been raised. It is hard to escape the conclusion that it is making preparations for a military clash with China.  In another development, the Indian government announced on Wednesday that it will impose anti-dumping duties on 93 products imported from China, which can only be regarded as another provocation by India.  China does not want a war with India; it does not want conflict of any kind with its neighbor. That explains why China has employed the utmost restraint by repeatedly asking India to withdraw its troops and warning it about the serious consequences should a military conflict take place.  It is wrong and stupid of India to consider China's restraint as a sign of weakness and taking it for granted. By doing so, India is walking further down a dangerous path, which will take it anywhere but a destination with both diplomatic and substantial gains.  India should come to its senses and understand that there is a limit to China's restraint. It would be a grave miscalculation to expect China to give in and make concessions at the expense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.  India will only shoot itself in the foot if it persists with its stubborn refusal to pull its troops out of Chinese territory, and it will only shame itself by coercing China to take whatever action it is necessary to drive the trespassing troops out of Chinese territory.  India should pull its troops out before it is too late.            "
Trump asking too much from Beijing on peninsula issue,8/14/2017,"                              Sino-US trade / China Daily    US President Donald Trump will reportedly sign an executive memorandum on Monday authorizing the US trade representative to determine whether to investigate the allegedly ""unfair"" Chinese trade practices, which could pave the way for punitive tariffs on Chinese exports.    But it is of critical strategic significance that his administration demonstrates reason and avoids making a rash decision it will soon regret.  Given Trump's transactional approach to foreign affairs, it is impossible to look at the matter without taking into account his increasing disappointment at what he deems as China's failure to bring into line the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. His idea of exploiting trade as a bargaining chip in dealings with China dates back to the campaign trail.  But instead of advancing the United States' interests, politicizing trade will only acerbate the country's economic woes, and poison the overall China-US relationship.  Blaming China for ""unfair"" trade is unfair in the first place. The trade imbalance, regular fodder for China-bashing on Capitol Hill, is, to a great extent, self-inflicted, an outcome of the US' political restrictions on exports to China. Yet this essential aspect is conspicuously absent in the US' narrative. The list of US gains in trade with China can grow or shrink, depending on how trade issues are handled.  While Trump's prior identity as a businessman may explain his transactional propensity, the deal he seeks demands the impossible of Beijing.  It is unfair for him to consign the burden of dissuading Pyongyang on Beijing; likewise to accuse Beijing of doing ""little"" or ""nothing"".  East Asia expert and former US ambassador to the Republic of Korea Christopher Hill was correct in observing Trump should not ""outsource"" the US' own troubles to China.  As Chinese President Xi Jinping again told Trump on Saturday, Beijing also seeks denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It would not have voted in favor of the latest United Nations resolution against Pyongyang's missile/nuclear adventures if this was not the case. The only difference is, Beijing wants to break the circle of escalation.  By trying to incriminate Beijing as an accomplice in the DPRK's nuclear adventure and blame it for a failure that is essentially a failure of all stakeholders, Trump risks making the serious mistake of splitting up the international coalition that is the means to resolve the issue peacefully.  Hopefully Trump will find another path. Things will become even more difficult if Beijing and Washington are pitted against each other.               "
No grounds for India to claim it is aiding Bhutan,8/11/2017,"                              A pedestrian using a smartphone walks past stores selling mobile phones and accessories at the Nehru Place IT Market in New Delhi, India, May 30, 2017. [Photo/VCG]    Nearly two months after India sent its troops across the Sikkim section of the border with China into the Donglang area, triggering a standoff between Chinese and Indian soldiers, New Delhi has continued to drag its feet over pulling its trespassing troops back onto Indian soil despite the repeated protests and warnings Beijing has made.    One of the excuses India has given for its troops crossing the long delimited border is that Donglang is a territory contested by China and Bhutan, and it is standing up for its small ally against what it claims is China's bullying of Bhutan.  The logic is ridiculous, even dangerous as the premise for action, since it sets a bad precedent of a regional power sending troops onto foreign soil in the name of protecting a third party's sovereignty.  Actually, as friendly neighboring countries, China and Bhutan-though they are yet to establish diplomatic relations because of India's interventions-have agreed to solve their border disputes through talks and consultations.  So far 24 rounds of border negotiations have been held and there are ample reasons to believe they will yield results if India stops throwing wrenches in the works.  Although Bhutan is yet to make a public statement, understandably given India's involvement, in a development that may come as a slap on the face of India, Bhutan has conveyed to Beijing through non-diplomatic channels that the area of the standoff is not its territory, the Press Trust of India reported on Tuesday, quoting Wang Wenli, deputy head of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  Instead of mending its ways and withdrawing its troops immediately from Chinese territory as Beijing has repeatedly urged, India seems to be preparing for the ""long haul"". It is repairing its roads to the rear of the standoff, stocking up on supplies and massing a large number of armed personnel, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  The adventurous trespassing by India can be attributed to its sense of insecurity given the friendly relations between China and Pakistan, but such concerns do not justify its rising chauvinism, which means it sees its small neighbor Bhutan as a vassal state rather than a sovereign and independent nation.  China has a strong will to solve the problem peacefully, but India keeps paying lip service to that by refusing to withdraw its trespassing troops. India should be fully aware of the consequences if it persists with its reckless behavior.               "
"Instead of hurling threats, US and DPRK should talk",8/9/2017,"                                                     FILE PHOTO: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference after talks with Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs at the State Department in Washington, US, June 21, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    First it was United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stating Washington's willingness to talk with Pyongyang, if the latter halts its missile stunts.    Then US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against making ""any more threats"" to his country, which he promised ""will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"".   Neither seems to have worked, though. Pyongyang's attitude, which Tillerson deems critical to the US engaging in dialogue, remains defiant.  Responding to Tillerson's offer, DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Manila that his country ""under no circumstances"" will put its nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles on the negotiating table. And on Wednesday, the Korean People's Army announced it is ""carefully examining"" an operational plan for ""enveloping fire"" around the US military bases at Guam with its newly-acquired missile capabilities.  The latest round of saber-rattling between Pyongyang and Washington is particularly ominous because, although both parties sent ""mixed messages"" and hinted at a degree of flexibility, both set impossible preconditions.   So while it is good that neither has slammed the door shut on potential talks, it looks increasingly like a ploy to sabotage that prospect.   Pyongyang has justified its plan for missile strikes on Guam with Washington's ""reckless military provocation"", while the latter has employed the same pretext for refusing dialogue. Over time, this mutual finger-pointing has pulled both into a spiral of escalating distrust and hostility, which is the biggest obstacle to resolving the crisis.  The US' approach to the standoff has been counterproductive because it has simply escalated the threat from Pyongyang's nuclear/missile programs.  While some of Pyongyang's claims of technological breakthroughs no doubt need to be taken with a grain of salt, it has been making steady progress despite the strict international scrutiny and sanctions.  And now, Pyongyang has intercontinental ballistic missiles and reportedly a miniaturized nuclear warhead. From this point on, the threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang cannot be taken lightly.   United Nations Resolution 2371, which authorizes additional, potentially damaging sanctions against the DPRK's military adventures, is a timely response, and it is widely anticipated they will finally bite. But sanctions alone may not easily bring Pyongyang to its senses and the Beijing-proposed ""dual suspension"" approach, a freeze on the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile tests in exchange for a cessation of the large-scale military drills conducted by the US and the Republic of Korea, fair as it is, needs a starting point.   While making sure the UN sanctions are fully, honestly implemented, stakeholders must also make meaningful endeavors to persuade the US and the DPRK to take a step back from the brink.                  "
Japan's shameless about-face,8/9/2017,"                              Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends a news conference after reshuffling his cabinet, at his official residence in Tokyo, Japan, August 3, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    What Japan's defense white paper, which was released on Tuesday, says about China is an about-face to what Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Monday.    Kono said Japan attaches importance to China, and the two countries can make important contributions to revitalizing Asia and promoting world peace by working hand-in-hand. Japan's defense white paper, on the other hand, portrayed a threatening China seeking to expand its military influence and territorial claims.  It is true Japan attaches importance to China, but in a malicious manner.  While China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations made headway by concluding the framework for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, Japan along with the United States and Australia jointly released a statement pointing an accusing finger at China for the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.  Although it, as an outsider, has nothing to do with the South China Sea disputes, Japan spares no efforts in trying to stir up trouble and hinder China and the other territorial claimants in the waters from resolving their disputes through dialogues.  By seizing every opportunity to paint China as a ""military threat"" in the region, especially to Japan, the Abe administration hopes to be able to push though changes to the country's pacifist Constitution and play a bigger role as an accomplice of the US in the latter's efforts to undermine China's influence in the region, in order to serve Tokyo's ambitions for regional leadership.  Japan's upending of China's policy of seeking dialogue to resolve the disputes flies in the face of the progress China has made with the ASEAN member states on the issue of the South China Sea, the improvement of relations with the Philippines being a case in point.  Japan should stop being double-faced, which will do it no good and only betray the fact that it is the real troublemaker in the region and thus the real threat to regional and world peace.  As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said to Kono on Monday, China hopes Japan matches its words with actions and translates its positive stance about improving ties with China into tangible policies and actions.                  "
New Delhi should come to its senses while it has time,8/8/2017,"                                             As the standoff in Donglang between Chinese and Indian border troops enters its seventh week, the window for a peaceful solution is closing.   The countdown to a clash between the two forces has begun, and the clock is ticking away the time to what seems to be an inevitable conclusion.  But it doesn't have to be so. Beijing has time and again sent the message that to avoid conflict all India needs to do is withdraw all its troops from an area that based on historical treaties, historically expressed agreements and long-exercised control both have long agreed is Chinese territory.   The Ministry of Defense has warned India not to harbor any illusions and underestimate the resolve of the People's Liberation Army to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. There is a ""bottom line"" to the restraint shown by China to India's trespass, as a ministry spokesman said.   Anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear will have got the message. Yet New Delhi refuses to come to its senses and pull its troops back to its own side of the border.   Different from the previous standoffs that happened at parts of the border contested by both countries, the military deployment by India this time, which even in its own words is on foreign soil — India says Donglang is territory disputed by China and Bhutan — has sabotaged long-standing agreements and understandings the two sides have worked hard to build over the years.   India's justifications for this — its own security concerns and its support for Bhutan — do not stand up to scrutiny, as made clear by the position paper released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and do not excuse its illegal act.   India's audacity in challenging China's sovereignty may come from its own sense of inferiority and insecurity in the face of China's rapid rise to prominence in the region, but betting on Beijing backing away from a fight because of its desire for a peaceful neighborhood is a risk, as it ignores the fact that the foundation for that is countries respecting China's territorial integrity.   India's trespassing is changing the long and legally established status quo in the area and is thus an act that China has no option but to resist.  Yet being at loggerheads serves neither side any good, and a violent clash is still avoidable, even at this late stage.   He who stirs up trouble should end it, as a Chinese proverb goes. India should withdraw its troops while the clock is still ticking. It will only have itself to blame if its stubborn refusal to heed the voice of reason leads to consequences it regrets.         "
Vietnam out of step with rest of ASEAN,8/8/2017,"                              North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prak Sokhon, Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, Brunei Darrussalam's Foreign Minister Lim Jock Seng, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi link arms during the Gala Dinner of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AMM) and Related Meetings in Manila, Philippines, August 6, 2017.[Photo/Agencies]    At their meeting in Manila on Sunday, the foreign ministers of China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations spoke highly of the achievements made in China-ASEAN ties over the past 15 years and agreed to push their cooperation to an even higher level.    They also expressed satisfaction over the framework for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and agreed to make joint efforts so that their negotiations on a code of behavior in the waters can be started within the year.  As a hard-won result achieved through the joint efforts of the two sides to reach an agreement, the document mirrors the shared commitment to build peace and stability in the waters demonstrated by China and the ASEAN countries recently.  It seems, however, that Vietnam almost put a spanner in the works by attempting to push its own agenda during the meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers.  According to media reports, Hanoi struck a less harmonious note by hypocritically trying to insert tough language criticizing China's island building in the South China Sea, something Vietnam did first, resulting in a delay to the issuing of their joint statement on Saturday.  But with none of the other ASEAN members being like-minded, Vietnam's proposed phrases were not included in the communiqué released on Sunday.  As one of the 10 members, Vietnam should well know that it is by emphasizing consensus that ASEAN has become a major force in promoting integration and maintaining peace and stability in the region. Vietnam's attempt to sow seeds of discord does a disservice to itself, the other members and the region.  Since last year, tensions in the South China Sea have been ratcheted down due to the dedicated efforts of China and ASEAN to resolve their differences through dialogue, and both sides have been seeking to expand and deepen their cooperation.  With the situation in the South China Sea having ""stabilized remarkably"", as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted on Sunday, Vietnam should look to the future and focus on the bigger picture.  By readjusting its approach and attitude, and sincerely joining hands with the other ASEAN members to consolidate the positive progress made in ASEAN-China ties over the past year, Vietnam can help raise China-ASEAN relations to a new level.  China and ASEAN celebrate the 15th anniversary of their strategic partnership next year. By strengthening the synergy of their development plans and focusing on the Asian values of reciprocity, solidarity and good neighborliness, they can lead the process of regional integration and fully demonstrate its value.                  "
"Sanctions needed, talks essential",8/7/2017,"                      The United Nations' response to latest provocations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-its intercontinental ballistic missile launches on July 3 and 27-has been prompt, with the UN Security Council unanimously approving tough, new sanctions on Pyongyang.  UN resolution 2371, with the expected condemnation ""in the strongest terms"", bans coal and other exports from the DPRK totaling upwards of $1 billion, as well as new joint ventures with the DPRK and additional foreign investment in existing ones.  The sanctions will bite deep. A$1 billion cut in DPRK export revenues means Pyongyang will possibly lose one-third of what it earned last year.  But no matter how tough the sanctions are, on their own they will never be enough to achieve a lasting settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue. Nor will the use of force, as some are proposing, resolve the issue; indeed it will only make the situation worse.  What is needed is for all parties involved to come back to the negotiation table to hammer out a deal that can finally bring peace and stability to the potentially volatile region.  That is why the call in the UN resolution for the long-shelved Six-Party Talks to be restarted should be both lauded and supported by the international community.  Given what has happened in the previous talks involving the DPRK, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia, it would be naive to expect the talks once restarted to achieve anything substantial in a short period of time. But it should be borne in mind that it was amid previous dialogues among the six that progress was made on the issue, and it was only since the talks stopped that the situation has threatened to get out of hand.  For the resumption of the Six-Party Talks, China proposes that the DPRK suspend its nuclear and missile program and the United States its military drills, which is the most realistic and reasonable way to decrease tensions and pave the way for all parties to return to the negotiation table.  As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, sanctions are not the ultimate purpose but rather a means to bring all the parties concerned back to talks so they can realize the ultimate aim of resolving the peninsula issue for good.

China and ASEAN show they will not be impeded,8/7/2017,"                                                     North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prak Sokhon, Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, Brunei Darrussalam's Foreign Minister Lim Jock Seng, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi link arms during the Gala Dinner of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AMM) and Related Meetings in Manila, Philippines, August 6, 2017.[Photo/Agencies]      In a significant step toward building peace and stability in the South China Sea and the region at large, the foreign ministers of China and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed the framework for a Code of Conduct in the waters in Manila on Sunday.   It once again underscores the strong political will of China and the ASEAN countries to work together to maintain stability in the South China Sea and sustain the positive momentum they have established in their relations.  The drawing up of a framework outline for the proposed code of behavior designed to prevent clashes in the South China Sea has been a significant achievement. And as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out in Manila, the agreement on the framework has laid a solid foundation for substantive consultations on the Code of Conduct.   With their joint efforts to reach agreement, China and the members of ASEAN have also sent a strong message to the international community that they are fully capable of handling issues of common concern in the region without any interference from a third party.  For while China and ASEAN are looking to the future and seeking new prospects from working together for peace, stability, and prosperity, some countries outside the region seem intent on stirring up trouble and stoking tensions in the South China Sea.   This year, US President Donald Trump has continued the controversial practice of his predecessor and sent warships to the waters under the duplicitous pretext that such a show of force is to safeguard the freedom of navigation of commercial shipping.  The United States likes to accuse Beijing of trying to militarize the South China Sea, but it is the US and its close allies that are doing that: The United Kingdom being the latest to jump on the freedom of navigation bandwagon by proposing to send warships to the South China Sea next year.   If these outside forces really cared about freedom of navigation they would be supporting China and ASEAN’s efforts to promote peace and stability in the region rather than trying to undermine them.   To give substance to their words, they should join hands with China and ASEAN to safeguard and build on the hard-won positive momentum so that the South China Sea is a seaway for peace, friendship and cooperation.                  "
India must not misread patience as weakness,8/4/2017,"                              Major General Zhou Shangping (left), Senior Colonel Lu Yu and Senior Colonel Zhang Chengwen of the PLA Ground Force to brief reporters on July 24. Zou Hong/China Daily      It is good that Beijing has turned down New Delhi's request for negotiation to resolve the standoff in Donglang. Accepting it would have made a simple matter complicated, or even worse, changed the nature of it.  It is better that it try to clarify the truths of the matter-past and present-as well as the Chinese stance, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has done by issuing a fact sheet, because whatever moves Beijing chooses to make next, or is pressed to make, it should first set the record straight.  The fact sheet makes clear the essential truth that Indian troops have violated Chinese sovereignty by crossing an undisputed stretch of border and they refuse to withdraw despite repeated Chinese protests, requests and warnings.  For outsiders with inadequate information about the matter, it provides an understanding of why China has refused to negotiate.  And for New Delhi strategists hoping to ride the wave of recent Western anti-China propaganda that seeks to create an image of an ""assertive"" Beijing, this should be a wake-up call.  Since there is no dispute at the Sikkim section of the China-India border, as the 15-page document clarifies, unconditional withdrawal of the transgressing Indian soldiers is mandatory; nonnegotiable.  New Delhi may be betting on Beijing's preoccupation with ensuring stability for the upcoming BRICS Summit in Xiamen, East China's Fujian province.  China needs stability both at home and on its periphery for its development, but China will not sacrifice its territorial integrity for it. As has been said by many on many occasions, never underestimate the country's determination when it comes to safeguarding its sovereignty.  It is true that there is no tangible sign of a major military buildup on the Chinese side of the border, and that the standoff has been unusually restrained.  And it is also true that Beijing is not in the mood for a fight. On the contrary, China sees the border disputes with India as legacies of a bygone era that should be resolved through constructive engagement. It also appreciates New Delhi's sensitive pride and has tried hard to make its goodwill toward it understood. However, New Delhi should not misread such restraint, for to do so could have dire consequences.  Beijing has been correct in patiently insisting New Delhi withdraw its troops from Chinese territory. It should continue doing so until it is proven useless. A worst-case scenario should be avoided if at all possible.  However, if good manners do not work, in the end, it may be necessary to rethink our approach. Sometimes a head-on blow may work better than a thousand pleas in waking up a dreamer.         "
Tillerson's rational overture,8/3/2017,"                              US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference after talks with Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs at the State Department in Washington, US, June 21, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      As if to cover up their own helplessness on the issue, some countries have demonstrated a renewed penchant for pointing an accusing finger at China, alleging that China has not put enough pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to rein in its nuclear weapons program.  As well as provoking a new round of vehement criticism and condemnation from the international community, the test-launch of a second intercontinental ballistic missile by the DPRK on Friday prompted Washington to once again claim Beijing is not exercising the influence it has over Pyongyang.  US President Donald Trump tweeted after the launch that he was ""very disappointed"" with China and Beijing was doing ""nothing"" to curb Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Such accusations are unfair, as they are totally unfounded. China is doing all it can and employing whatever influence it has. It has consistently and fully implemented UN Security Council resolutions, and repeatedly urged the DPRK to respect the collective will of the international community and cease any activities that escalate tensions.  Trump's implication that Beijing is somehow at fault for the US' current unease is simply a reflection of what has been his administration's inaccurate assessment of the situation.  Which is why US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's latest remarks on the issue are so welcome; they suggest the US has adopted a more rational perspective.  At a US State Department briefing on Monday, Tillerson said the US does not blame China for the escalating tensions and the US is willing to sit down and negotiate with the DPRK over its nuclear weapons program in coordination with China.  Tillerson's remarks hopefully signal Washington has adopted a more pragmatic approach to the issue and it is willing to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang in a bid to break the current impasse.  No stakeholder can single-handedly resolve the Korean Peninsula issue. But instead of concerted efforts to defuse the volatile tensions on the peninsula, the finger-pointing has merely highlighted the growing divergences among stakeholders on how to resolve the issue, which has threatened to prompt reckless moves that would exacerbate the already fragile situation.  It is hoped the US will now make concrete moves to translate Tillerson's words into action, and the DPRK will demonstrate its own sincerity to de-escalating tensions.         "
By politicizing trade ties US would harm itself,8/3/2017,"                              A worker looks closely as containers are unloaded in Qingdao Port, Shandong province. [Photo/China Daily]      Reports that US President Donald Trump is considering imposing restrictions on Chinese imports, with an announcement forthcoming as early as this week, are worrying, because the move, if taken, could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies.  The United States' grievances stem from its huge trade deficit with China, which now stands at $368 billion, and what it regards as China's weak protection of intellectual property rights. Section 301 of the US' Trade Act of 1974 allows Trump to impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect US industries from ""unfair practices"" without following the dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization.  That Washington is backpedaling on the joint efforts the two countries have made to narrow their differences on trade will be a blow to the mutual trust that both sides have worked hard to build. It could also compromise the one-year action plan on economic cooperation they agreed at the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington on July 19. The plan for a year of discussions is aimed at building on the positive momentum achieved in the 100-Day Action Plan trade negotiations between the two sides initiated after the summit meeting in April between Trump and President Xi Jinping.  The timing of the proposed move has sparked speculation that Trump is trying to punish China for what he sees as Beijing's failure to help him rein in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear weapons program. But that assumption is unfounded, and politicizing the trade issue in this way risks harming Sino-US relations.  Beijing always insists that trade disputes and frictions, which are inevitable given the size of the two economies, should be resolved through dialogue and consultations. And this is imperative given how complementary and interdependent the two economies are.  If it resorts to a domestic law to address its trade disputes with China, rather than relying on dialogue or the dispute-settlement mechanism of the WTO, the US would belie its claim that it wants to build ""fair, equitable and reciprocal"" trade relations with China. And imposing tariffs and restrictions on Chinese imports would serve the interests of neither side, since China will have no choice but to take retaliatory measures, thus paving the way for a trade war. Both sides should work hard to avoid that damaging eventuality.         "
Peninsula issue requires unity,8/2/2017,"                              US House Speaker Paul Ryan (Front) speaks at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, the United States, on July 25, 2017. The US House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill that will slap tougher sanctions on Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). [Photo/Xinhua]      The best scenario in pursuing denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula-all stakeholders jointly pursuing a peaceful resolution-appears increasingly distant and unachievable. Indeed, there are signs that the fragile solidarity that had appeared to have been forged recently has already crumbled, since the apportioning of blame has resurged after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea test-launched its second intercontinental ballistic missile in a month.  By all measures, Pyongyang's latest progress in intercontinental ballistic missile technology is bad for all parties concerned. Not only is it in clear violation of United Nations resolutions, but it also constitutes a greater threat to peace and stability in the region.  Pyongyang's right to develop nuclear capabilities aside, its constant saber-rattling cannot but be taken as a dangerous threat to all, including China, which feels threatened by the damage Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ambitions may inflict on its immediate neighborhood.  For that reason, although US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration at what he considers Beijing's failure to dissuade Pyongyang from its nuclear adventure, Beijing has every reason to feel unfairly burdened with a task that is obviously beyond it, especially as it has been working diligently to broker a peaceful resolution to the crisis.  Trump is wrong in his assumption that Beijing can single-handedly handle the matter. As Beijing has said, repeatedly, it does not have the kind of ""control"" over Pyongyang that the US president believes it does.  Nor will Beijing accept Trump's allegation that it has done nothing. From Beijing's perspective, it has significantly increased the pressure on Pyongyang by doing everything the strengthened UN sanctions regime requires of it.  The only thing that has proven to be true so far is no country can solve the DPRK problem by itself. The logical conclusion, therefore, is the stakeholders need to work more closely together in order to find a way to guarantee peace on the peninsula.  Unfortunately, Trump's threat to link the issue to trade and mount pressure on China show these two stakeholders are moving further apart rather than coming together.  This lack of unity is a formula for failure and may, instead of a peaceful resolution, lead to a worst-case scenario.         "
Reforms can ensure PLA better fulfills all its duties,8/2/2017,"                              The flag raising ceremony during the military parade at Zhurihe training base in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region Sunday, July 30, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      On the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on its historical contributions, development and the necessity of further reform.  What the PLA has accomplished over the past 90 years can be boiled down to its indispensability to the founding of the People's Republic of China, the irreplaceable role it has played in guaranteeing a peaceful environment for the republic's economic development and social progress and the contributions it has made to maintaining world peace.  Without a strong military, it would have been unimaginable for China to achieve what it has and make the contributions it has to the overall development of the global economy.  And it should go without saying that the country needs a strong and modern military to counter any aggression and to defend its sovereignty and territory integrity.  Just as President Xi said in his speech, Chinese people treasure peace and will never wage a war of aggression, but they will never allow any of its territory to be scraped away, in any form, at any time.  To guarantee it never has to swallow this bitter pill and ensure it can counter any aggression, further reform is needed to make its national defense stronger.  Taiwan still has to be reunified with the motherland, and some secessionists on the island harbor the intention of making it an ""independent"" country, and there are also the threats of terrorism and extremism.  To counter these threats and safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, the military needs further reform so that it is not only ready to fight but also able to win.  A founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of its Security Council, China has also become increasingly involved in the UN's global peacekeeping operations as its capabilities have developed. In recent years, the PLA has undertaken a growing number of peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions, and the number of troops China has contributed to such missions is more than any other Security Council member.  But to do a better job of fulfilling its UN obligations, China needs further reform to modernize its military.  As the PLA celebrates its 90th anniversary, the contributions it has made to a politically stable and economically prosperous China can never be overestimated, and its efforts to better shoulder its international responsibilities should be welcomed.

Local officials need more environmental awareness,8/1/2017,"                              Smoke rises from a chimneys of a steel mill on a hazy day in Fengnan district of Tangshan, Hebei province February 18, 2014.[Photo/Agencies]      The environmental inspection teams sent by the central authorities to oversee the anti-pollution efforts of the local governments in Tianjin and five provinces, including Anhui, Shanxi and Liaoning, have described the situations they found as ""shocking"".  In Tianjin, where petrochemical industries thrive, air pollution worsened in the first quarter of this year, with the intensity of PM2.5-particulate matter with diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometers that can penetrate deep into people's lungs-increasing by 28 percent year-on-year.  In Anhui province, 740,000 square meters of wetland surrounding its biggest lake, Chaohu, have been turned into an industrial waste dump, and the worsening water quality resulted in more than 30 percent of the lake being covered in algae last year.  The inspection teams also found some local officials forged environmental data, and, when pollution problems were exposed, merely gave the violators a slap on the wrist.  The inspectors attributed the problems to the weak environmental awareness of local officials, who don't appreciate its importance and tend to pay lip service to the central government's call for strengthened environmental protection while favoring local economic growth no matter the cost to the environment.  According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the central environmental inspection teams have so far visited 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions since the start of 2016. Fines of 880 million yuan ($129 million) have been imposed and more than 1,000 people detained for cases related to pollution. Tens of thousands of officials have also been held accountable for their inaction or dereliction of duty with regard to environmental protection.  This shows that despite the central leadership's call for green and sustainable development, the environmental situation in many places continues to deteriorate.  The dire and worsening pollution in many parts of the country shows that stricter measures are needed to target violators of the environmental regulations and officials who fail in their duty to protect the environment. However, greater efforts are also needed to upgrade the growth model of local economies, too many of which still rely on traditional polluting industries.  As President Xi Jinping has said, green mountains and clear water are more valuable than mountains of gold and silver. To drive home this message, more heads need to roll, so that local officials take seriously their duty to protect the environment and promote more sustainable development.  To build an ecological civilization, local officials must pursue economic growth that is innovative, coordinated and more environmentally friendly.         "
Xi's profound changes to the PLA on display,7/31/2017,"                              The flag raising ceremony during the military parade at Zhurihe training base in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region Sunday, July 30, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    It was the first time a large-scale parade had been staged as part of commemorations to mark the founding of the People's Liberation Army, which celebrates its 90th birthday on Tuesday.    It was the first time a parade of such scale and importance has been held in the field.  It was the first time President and PLA commander-in-chief Xi Jinping was seen in PLA fatigues on an occasion like this.  It was the first time some of the PLA's new weapons made their media debut.  All these firsts occurred on Sunday at Zhurihe in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, which is the PLA's largest and most sophisticated combined tactics training base.  That the show was staged at the once mysterious Zhurihe, a training base devoted specifically to drills in simulated combat environments, where the PLA's latest weapons along with its latest tactics and methods of operation are tested, was not only further proof that the PLA is embracing greater transparency but also a sign of its greater self-confidence.  China's past experience of being ravaged by foreign powers has cultivated in Xi an acute awareness of the nation's need for a strong, capable military.  Although to some scrutinizing it from a different perspective it may have sent a divergent message, as Xi told the PLA troops on parade on Sunday, the country needs a strong military ""more than ever"" as the world is far from tranquil, and the country's peace needs to be guarded.  And certainly, above all, Sunday's parade was a review of the military reform Xi has masterminded and presided over.  Barely a year after he assumed leadership of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Xi incorporated national defense and military reform into the country's comprehensive reform plans. For the first time in history, national defense and military reform were written into the resolutions of a CPC plenum as an independent section.  Two years later, Xi officially inaugurated the ongoing reforms amid a high-profile anti-corruption campaign within the PLA. An overall plan was announced in July, followed by a 300,000 cut in PLA troops in September and an implementation plan for command system reform in October.  Since then, the PLA has realized a profound change in structure and strategic thinking.  The formations at the Sunday parade were reportedly structured in combat groupings to reflect the PLA's new emphasis on joint operations, echoing Xi's idea that combat effectiveness is the fundamental gauge for the military, and demonstrating that the PLA is getting closer to what Xi envisions as a leaner, more capable, world-class modern military.

Australia should address its anti-China tendencies,7/28/2017,"                              Sydney Opera House in Sydney Nov 11, 2014.[Photo/IC]      When the new school term began in Australia recently, posters appeared on the campuses of some universities warning Chinese students not to enter the university buildings. Such racism should be condemned by the whole of Australian society, and the relevant authorities should do more to guard against the spread of anti-China sentiment in universities.  These racist posters obviously hurt the feelings of not only Chinese students studying in Australia but the entire Chinese community in the country. It is to be hoped the perpetrators can be found and held accountable.  In recent years, Chinese students have contributed hugely to Australia's education sector, as they account for one-third of one of the country's pillar industries, bringing in approximately 20 billion Australian dollars ($16 billion) a year. Chinese students enrolled in Australian universities have the right to enjoy a peaceful and friendly school environment. Australia should also show the outside world that it respects people from other cultures.  Unfortunately, the posters are just the latest in a series of China-smearing incidents that have flared up in Australia over the past few months. Posters mocking Chinese property buyers, whom some Australians believe should be held responsible for fueling rising prices in Australia's property market, were seen in Sydney earlier this month. And in June, an Australian TV program falsely accused China of trying to influence the Australian political system by ""manipulating"" the Chinese community in Australia. To add fuel to the fire, some Australian politicians have talked in an unfriendly manner about China or aired biased and unjust opinions on the territorial disputes involving China and some of its neighbors.  Such a worrying tendency should raise the alarm because, if it remains unchecked, it will undermine the generally good momentum in China-Australia interaction.  Such an ill tendency runs counter to the two governments' efforts to deepen both the scope and the depth of bilateral cooperation. And it does not reflect the ever-increasing interactions of the two economies and their robust people-to-people exchanges.  Generally speaking, China and Australia relations are not plagued by any longstanding issues between them, meaning they should be able to effectively anchor their bilateral ties with friendly cooperation.  Yet, due to the deep-rooted bias harbored by some Australians toward China and the influence of a Cold War mentality, anti-China sentiments do flare up from time to time. It is high time the Australian government countered these undesirable misperceptions that hinder the healthy development of China-Australia ties.         "
Beijing-Manila rapport sets inspiring example,7/27/2017,"                              Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, accompanied by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, is greeted at Beijing Capital International Airport at the start of his fourday state visit on Oct 18, 2016. HE XIAOHUI / FOR CHINA DAILY      There may be no better example of the Chinese diplomatic saying ""Harmony benefits both, while confrontation hurts"" than the China-Philippines relationship.  Just a year ago, when Benigno Aquino III was the Philippine leader, Beijing and Manila were locked in confrontation following the South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines.  Who at that time could have anticipated the ""all-round reversal"" in the two countries' relationship hailed by visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Manila on Tuesday?  As Wang remarked, in a little more than six months, exchanges in ""all fields have been restored in an all-round manner"".  And the rapport is not just rhetoric. Judging from Wang's exchanges with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte as well as his Philippine counterpart, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, it looks likely Beijing and Manila may start serious talks about a 1986 agreement between then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Philippine Vice-President Salvador Laurel for the two countries to jointly exploit resources in the South China Sea.  If that step is finally taken, it will not only be the realization of the 31-year-old proposal, it will also be an inspiring example for all claimant countries of how to handle their disputes in the South China Sea.  As Wang said, shelving disputes and engaging in collaboration is a far better option than taking unilateral actions and becoming stranded in damaging confrontation.  In sharp contrast to when Aquino III was president and the tense standoff he sparked froze trade ties, Duterte's diplomatic pragmatism is laying a solid foundation for constructive ties, which will surely result in tangible rewards.  The Chinese foreign minister is now referring to Manila as ""an indispensable, important partner"" for building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, stating the Belt and Road will be a highlight of their next-step cooperation. The initiative's heavy input in interconnectivity may be a tremendous boost for the infrastructure-hungry Philippine economy.  Vowing China will be ""the most sincere and enduring partner"" of the Philippines for its national development, Wang also promised strong Chinese support for the latter in domestic and international affairs, including its crusade against drugs and terrorism.  The dramatic reversal in the China-Philippine relationship has proved Beijing's proclaimed belief that the claimants in the South China Sea disputes are fully capable of handling their disagreements on their own. Yet attempts by third parties to muddy the waters have never stopped. And it may not be realistic to expect those claimant countries to demonstrate solidarity in the face of powerful outsider intervention and say no to it.  Manila's rapport with Beijing, however, will certainly be conducive to managing the other unresolved disputes in the waters.         "
Focus on stabilizing growth and defusing major risks,7/26/2017,"                              A worker monitors container operation at Zhoushan port in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. [Photo/China Daily]      The most recent data have shown that the momentum of the country's economic development is getting stronger, with the economic indicators for the first half of the year beating expectations and urban employment steadily improving. There has also been further progress in growth rebalancing, with the ratio of consumption to GDP increasing and the service sector's share in the economy continuing to grow.  But despite the good momentum in the first half of this year, the country's leaders are conscious of the need to strike a balance between stabilizing growth and the defusing of major risks, as signaled by the statement released after a meeting of the country's top leadership on Monday.  Although the fundamentals remain sound, prompting the International Monetary Fund to raise its forecast of the country's growth this year from 6.6 percent to 6.7 percent, it was recognized at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee presided over by General Secretary Xi Jinping, that this does not mean the economic and financial risks can be ignored.  The authorities need to remain focused so they do the right things at the right time, as Xi emphasized at a symposium on Friday.  Looking ahead, although policymakers will need to be prepared for a possible economic slowdown in the second half of this year as the cooling of the real estate market takes effect, the meeting has made it clear there will be no let up on reforms, and the continuity and consistency of policies will be maintained to push forward supply-side structural reform and guard against systemic financial risks.  This means measures will be introduced to further cut excess capacity and reduce inventory, as well as ease the corporate debt burden. And, as the statement released after Monday's meeting emphasized, the key to the success of these reforms is effectively handling ""zombie enterprises"", those unprofitable State-owned companies that are burdened with debt, mismanagement and/or overcapacity.  Other pressing tasks include controlling the local government debt problem, channeling more funds into the real economy and keeping a watchful eye on the financial market turbulences to ward off damaging repercussions.  Whether these tasks are successfully handled or not has significant implications for the country's economic transition and future development.  The commitment to reforms and the resolve to take a steadfast approach to economic liberalization demonstrated at the meeting should instill confidence that while maintaining stability is the priority, as Xi stressed, progress will continue to be pursued.

It is never too late for India to mend its way,7/25/2017,"                              The Ministry of Defense holds a news conference in Beijing, July 24, 2017. [Photo/chinadaily.com.cn]      In a strongly worded statement issued on Monday, the Ministry of Defense warned New Delhi not to ""harbor any illusions"" about deriving possible gains from its adventure in sending troops across the demarcated and mutually recognized Sikkim section of the border into Chinese territory.  The People's Liberation Army's determination to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity is resolute, MOD spokesman Wu Qian told a news conference, adding that ""it is easier to shake a mountain than to shake the PLA"".  The warning should not be taken lightly.  The PLA has already taken countermeasures and will increase its targeted deployments and drills, Wu said.  And let there be no doubt, the PLA means what it says. It will not let the nation swallow the bitter pill of having its sovereignty infringed upon. This is the country's bottom line, and the PLA will defend it at all costs.  India should realize that it is solely responsible for any consequences that may arise from the deteriorating situation, because its claims that China building a road in the region is a ""security concern"" by no means justify its troops trespassing across the border into China's territory in order to put a stop to the work.  There are still hopes that the deadlock can be resolved peacefully, which serves both countries' best interests.  India Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently said the two neighbors ""should not let differences become disputes"".  Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is scheduled to pay a visit to Beijing for meetings later this week, during which it is to be hoped he will carry on that slight shift in India's previously bellicose stance.  The two sides need to explore ways to avoid confrontation. It would be damaging to both countries and regional stability if India cannot use its reason and wisdom to avoid the military collision both countries are currently on course for.  If two sides can find a way to prevent the already tense situation at the border from getting out of control and end the deadlock peacefully, it would be in the interests of both as well as the region.  However, to work things out through talks requires India to correct its mistake by withdrawing its troops back to its own side of the border.  This, as Wu emphasized on Monday, is the prerequisite for any meaningful discussions to take place.         "
Withdrawal of its troops is India's best recourse,7/24/2017,"                              Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he addresses the nation from the historic Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations in Delhi, India, August 15, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      The trespassing in Chinese territory by Indian troops has now dragged into a second month. The longer they remain on the Chinese side of the long-demarcated and mutually recognized Sikkim section of the border, the less room there will be for peacefully ending the crisis.  Considering that both sides have reportedly sent more troops into the Donglang area, the face-off between Indian and Chinese troops, if not properly handled, could easily be the fuse that ignites a military clash between the two countries.  Especially as some Indian officials and media are bellicosely proclaiming that India today is different from the India of 1962, implying the country's military muscles have grown since then.  They should be aware that the same applies to China, if not more so.  China has so far exercised the utmost restraint and is still trying to defuse the situation in a peaceful manner. However, this should not be misinterpreted by India as a sign of weakness, as that would likely lead to it making a dangerous miscalculation. It should be aware that China has both the necessary means and the will to safeguard its territorial integrity.  Since the Indian troops have not been withdrawn from the Chinese territory, despite China's repeated urgings, their trespassing bears every emblem of being an incursion. If China's appeals for India to see sense and respect the demarcated border continue to fall on deaf ears then a military response may become inevitable.  This would not only disrupt the good momentum in ties that had seemed to be on the cards after recent bilateral high-level meetings, but also the peaceful environment the two economies need for their development.  Despite their disputes over other parts of the border, the Sikkim section of the China-India boundary has been delimited by treaty, and the Indian government has repeatedly confirmed in writing that it recognizes this part of the boundary. Yet Indian troops entered Chinese territory to obstruct the construction of a road.  Indian claims that the area where China is constructing the road is disputed by Bhutan and it is helping it as obligated by their friendship treaty. However, this is dissembling its real reasons, which stem from its own unfounded sense of insecurity and fear that it is losing out to China in regional influence.  Reports from India, suggest its troops in the Donglang are preparing to stay for the long haul. However, that will not be allowed. It is high time India corrected its wrongdoing and respected the demarcated boundary by withdrawing its troops from Chinese territory.         "
Sino-US trade talks fulfill task of forging consensus,7/21/2017,"                        Although no breakthroughs were announced after the first Comprehensive Economic Dialogue between China and the United States, both sides displayed a strong political will to continue to work together and build on the ""significant progress"" that they had achieved in their preceding talks for the 100-day economic plan.  Some clearly feel disappointed that Wednesday's high-level discussions in Washington did not produce any major outcomes, and such sentiments seem to be fueling a media backlash against China in the US.  Although even before the dialogue began, some US officials and media voiced criticism of China, alleging that it alone is responsible for the problems in Sino-US trade, especially the colossal trade deficit that is in China's favor.  However, such finger-pointing is both unwarranted and counterproductive-China has not single-handedly created the trade surplus.  To address their trade imbalance, the two sides need to continue to work together to find mutually acceptable solutions. Actions that only benefit one side will exacerbate the problems.  As long as the two sides keep having frank exchanges, there will be more possibility of the pair gradually bridging their differences and agreeing on ways to achieve their shared objectives of balance and fairness in their trade relations.  As Vice-Premier Wang Yang rightfully pointed out during the dialogue, the two countries are each other's major trading partner and important source of investment, so cooperation is their only realistic choice.  This has been demonstrated by their respective negotiating teams that have been working on the 100-day economic action plan agreed at the first summit between the leaders of the two countries in April, whose discussions have proved fruitful, both in producing practical outcomes and forging rapport.  There is every reason for the two sides to continue to build on the good momentum that has been attained in these consultations.  In this respect, it is encouraging that the two sides agreed to initiate a one-year action plan for economic cooperation.  Such a down-to-earth approach will guarantee more industry specific moves, which as they accumulate will usher in a healthier bilateral trade structure.  The Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, though not the cure some had hoped for, has reinforced that talks are the right way to remedy the ills in trade relations between the world's two largest economies.  Despite the talks not producing a magic wand with which to immediately make all the differences between the two sides disappear, they have reinforced the shared recognition that their discussions are helping to generate the necessary convergences with which to move forward, and they will continue to produce tangible results.         "
"With a little give and take, dialogue can bear fruit",7/20/2017,"                        There were a number of practical outcomes from the meeting between the US and Chinese presidents in Florida back in April. Among them are a 100-day economic plan for cooperation between the world's two largest economies and the restructuring of their wide-ranging high-level dialogues into four more focused dialogue mechanisms, including one on their economic ties.  As the first round of China-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue commenced in Washington DC on Wednesday, it was encouraging to note that since the two countries initiated their discussions on the 100-day economic plan, they have made headway in narrowing some of the divergences between them. More important, the intensive engagement over the 100 days is said to have helped the respective economic teams build trust.  There are expectations, therefore, that the economic dialogue will make more progress in easing trade frictions and bridging the differences that exist between the two sides.  There are complaints from the US side that the talks progress too slowly. US companies are eager to gain greater access to the Chinese market, and Washington is urging China to open up more quickly and cut its trade surplus with the United States.  Yet to further reduce the trade surplus, China needs to import more from the US, not only beef and beans, but also high technology products. This requires the US to take further steps to clear trade barriers in the form of outdated export controls, a byproduct of the Cold War, rather than unilaterally push China to open its market wider.  China's import of integrated circuits reached $227 billion last year, more than that of crude oil, iron ore and primary plastics combined. Yet only 4 percent of the IC import came from the US due to its export curbs, Vice-Premier Wang Yang said at a forum one day before the dialogue.  Also, if the US could liberalize its export barriers against China to the same level as those applicable to Brazil, the US trade deficit with China would narrow by up to 24 percent, he added, citing an April article by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  According to the US-China Business Council, US exports of goods and services to China will double to $369 billion in the next decade. With this big picture in mind, political and business leaders of both sides should bear in mind they have a shared stake in putting aside their differences and working together for a brighter future for Sino-US economic exchanges.  Whatever the speed of progress in the nitty-gritty details of their to-and-fro, it is essential that the two sides continue to work together to move their cooperation forward in a constructive fashion.

Moon's offer of talks brings hope of an end to impasse,7/19/2017,"                                 South Korean President Moon Jae-in attends a news conference in Berlin, Germany July 5, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    It remains to be seen how Pyongyang will respond to Seoul's formal overture for dialogue. Serious talks, whether on easing animosities along their tense border or on resuming the reunions of families separated by the Korean War in the early 1950s, as Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in proposed on Monday, are long overdue given the antagonism that has escalated and accumulated over the years.    The worsening state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula has brooded a mood of pessimism, so the new ROK leader's professed willingness to engage Pyongyang offers some cause for optimism, albeit slight, since none of similar past overtures for dialogue, even handshakes, produced any meaningful headway in relations.   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be aware that Moon, while extending an olive branch, has never promised to adopt a carrot-only approach. On the contrary, he has openly stated Seoul will continue to apply pressure so that Pyongyang will rethink its pursuit of nuclear and missile capabilities.   Not to mention Tokyo and Washington, Seoul's close allies, are calling for harsher sanctions. Immediately after Moon's offer to talk, Tokyo argued ""this is not a time for dialogue; it's a time for pressure"".   Washington has also stated the conditions for dialogue are far from being satisfied, as White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Monday, ""any type of conditions that would have to be met are clearly far away from where we are now.""   This should come as no surprise, considering the July 6 joint statement the US, Japanese and ROK leaders signed on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, which committed the three to applying ""maximum pressure"" on Pyongyang.   Pyongyang may be angry at what it sees as threatening saber-rattling by the United States, Japan and the ROK. But it should not take that as a reason for not responding or turning down the overture from the ROK. Especially since the window of goodwill may not last forever.   In making the offer, Moon defied pressure both from opponents at home as well as from Washington and Tokyo. An unanswered overture will not only dissuade Moon personally, but also reinforce the case of Washington and Tokyo that his policy of engagement is ill-advised. In that case, Pyongyang will find its room for maneuver has substantially shrunk.   While the vicious circle of escalating tensions has allowed Pyongyang to continue with its nuclear weapons program, the risks stemming from that endeavor have simultaneously grown.   Pyongyang's best course of action now would be to embrace Moon's offer, and get serious about his proposals, including that of cooperation on the 2018 Winter Olympics.                   "
Growth momentum even stronger with reforms,7/18/2017,"                             Early this year, China watchers expressed concerns that the country's economy might start to weaken in the second quarter. However, the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics show such concerns were unfounded, and the world's second-largest economy remains resilient.    The economy expanded by 6.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the same as in the first quarter, according to the figures released by the NBS on Monday. Even more encouraging, key indicators, such as industrial output and consumption, reveal that improvements are being made in adjusting the country's economic structure.  Investment in high-tech industries, for example, increased by 21.5 percent, 12.9 percentage points higher than overall investment growth, while retail sales of consumer goods grew 10.4 percent year-on-year, up from 10 percent in the first quarter. And the service sector, which already accounts for 54.1 percent of the overall economy, expanded 7.7 percent year-on-year in the first half of the year. According to the NBS, domestic consumption now accounts for 63.4 percent of GDP growth, which highlights the progress China is making in its bid to make innovation and domestic demand the drivers of economic growth.  Considering that this performance has been achieved against the backdrop of efforts to reduce excess production capacity and cut corporate debt levels, the figures are not only impressive, but also suggest the country has managed to successfully strike a balance in its bid to promote economic growth and restructuring.  Looking to the future, China will continue to press ahead with its tasks of reducing excessive production capacity, cutting real estate stocks, and lowering corporate debt levels, while further strengthening its environmental protection and water conservancy efforts.  Although policymakers will need to remain alert to the possibility of slower growth in the third quarter, there can be little doubt that the country is on course to achieve its pre-set GDP growth target of ""around 6.5 percent"" for the year.  With its growth target attainable, and the economy maintaining stable and coordinated development, the leadership has more room to push ahead with economic restructuring and reforms. Financial reform, for example, is on the cards, after the country consolidated its financial regulatory power at the newly-concluded National Financial Work Conference, which ended on Saturday.  And further headway in advancing the necessary reforms will in turn make the Chinese economy more efficient, competitive and sustainable in the coming years.                  "
Guarding against risks for a sound financial sector,7/17/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping speaks at the National Financial Work Conference in Beijing July 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    The two-day  National Financial Work Conference, which ended in Beijing on Saturday, made containing financial risks one of the country's top priorities.    The meeting, presided over by President Xi Jinping, was held against the backdrop of growing enterprise debt, an overheating real estate market, and overcapacity in such sectors as low-end manufacturing.  The debt of non-financial enterprises in China reached 170 percent of its GDP in 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  And in its 2017 China Financial Stability Report released early this month, China's central bank, People's Bank of China, pointed to ""the risk of bubbles"" emerging in some parts of the country. The report notes that housing loans comprised a quarter of all loans, and accounted for 44.8 percent of all new lending since the start of this year.  All this, as well as the risks in interbank and off-balance sheet business, prompted the central bank to emphasize the need for strengthened financial regulatory capability and better regulatory coordination in its report. Only through guarding against financial risks can a sound and stable financial sector better fulfill its duty and purpose of serving the real economy.  The lack of cooperation among the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission was to blame for some of the problems and potential risks in the financial sector and many believe it has also encouraged regulatory arbitrage and fueled the growth of risky financial products.  Thus a committee is to be set up under the State Council aimed at markedly improving coordination among the three agencies and promoting greater sharing of information and plugging gaps in their oversight.  Despite some ringing the alarm bells, the risks in China's financial sector are controllable. Bad bank loans remain at a low level, liquidity in the market is stable, and sound economic growth in the first half of the year means the central bank does not need to continue to expand credit to spur growth, thus providing more leeway for financial reform measures.  And the government will continue to deleverage the economy by implementing a firm and prudent monetary policy, reduce the leverage of State-owned enterprises and local government debt, and crack down on financial irregularities.  As Xi said at the meeting, the government must take the initiative to monitor, warn against and deal with risks in a timely manner. The new committee will help do these.                        "
Rule of law and justice must always prevail,7/15/2017,"                              Residents outside the high court hold placards and shout slogans on Friday to support the disqualification of four lawmakers who did not follow the requirements when they took their oaths to serve on the Legislative Council in October last year. [Photo by ROY LIU/CHINA DAILY]      In a written ruling on Friday, the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region disqualified four opposition members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) on the ground that they deliberately messed up their oaths of office at the swearing-in ceremony last October and therefore violated Article 104 of the Basic Law and Section 21 of Hong Kong's Oaths and Declarations Ordinance.  The ruling concluded court deliberations over a judicial review filed by Leung Chun-ying, then Hong Kong chief executive, and the Department of Justice challenging the legitimacy of the four wayward politicians' LegCo membership.  It is a ruling Hong Kong residents had been waiting for since the High Court began hearing the case and yet another proof the rule of law in the SAR is still sound and effective.  The four-Leung Kwok-hung, Lau Siu-lai, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Yiu Chung-yim-now join former lawmakers-elect Sixtus Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching, who were disqualified for the same reason late last year. They all changed the text of the oath of office and/or put on acts of mockery to show they reject the whole idea of taking the oath according to the Basic Law, which is mandatory for all legislators-elect. And the failure to do so means disqualification from LegCo.  The two cases show that certain political figures have no respect for the rule of law and hold a particular grudge against the Basic Law because it is a law of the People's Republic of China, the sovereign state Hong Kong is a part of.  The latest court decision deems Leung, Lau, Law and Yiu disqualified from office the day they messed up with their oaths of office last October, which means they have no right to participate in LegCo business any longer.  However, all four of them, with the support of their fellow legislators, refused to leave the conference room when the chairman of the LegCo finance committee, which was in session at that time, told them to leave after hearing the news about the court ruling. As a result the chairman had to adjourn the meeting till Saturday. That some so-called lawmakers are hell-bent on defying court rulings shows their true color. And one could imagine how much respect these now-disqualified lawmakers have for the legal system.  Apart from the six disqualified legislators, some other LegCo members, too, didn't take the oath of office according to relevant laws. Several others are suspect and may have to face justice in the near future. Some of them had indulged in equally deplorable acts on a previous occasion and got away with it. The court ruling shows no one can violate the law and expect to escape justice.         "
Law has to seek truth in US kidnap case,7/14/2017,"                              People react at the end of the bond hearing for Brendt Christensen outside of the US Courthouse on July 3, 2017 in Urbana, Illinois. [Photo/VCG]      A US federal grand jury indicted Brendt Christensen on a count of kidnapping on Wednesday in connection with the disappearance of Zhang Yingying, a 26-year-old Chinese research student at the University of Illinois, and who was last seen at its Urbana-Champaign campus on June 9.  Christensen will now formally enter a plea to the charge at an arraignment scheduled for July 20.        The penalty for kidnapping is up to life in prison if convicted. And for many in China, it is an open and shut case.  Surveillance video shows Zhang, who was on her way to sign a lease for an apartment, climbing into a vehicle that investigators later identified as Christensen's car.  A search of the car found the passenger's side had been thoroughly cleaned.  And a search of Christensen's cellphone found he had visited a website that included threads on ""perfect abduction fantasy"" and ""planning a kidnapping"".  However, an indictment is merely an accusation.  Although people may have decided in their own minds that Christensen is guilty based on the reports they have avidly been following, he has not confessed to any crime nor has he been proven guilty in a court of law. That means, as the US Attorney's Office in Urbana reminded people, the law must presume him innocent.  Since the one-page indictment on Wednesday did not offer any new details beyond what the FBI and prosecutors had already revealed in an affidavit and court hearings, the whereabouts of Zhang, and whether she is alive or not, remain unknown.  However, a criminal complaint filed before Christensen was arrested on June 30, shows that although there have been many reported sightings of Zhang, law enforcement officials believe she is dead.  The uncertainty surrounding her fate, and people's clinging to the hope that she will still be found alive and well, has provoked an outpouring of anger among her compatriots directed at the investigators, who have been unable to determine what happened to Zhang after she got into Christensen's car.  It is to be hoped the investigation can be pursued until the mystery is solved, not only for the peace of mind of her parents, but also to show the law seeks justice for the victims of crimes who are not US citizens.  Zhang, from Nanping in East China's Fujian province, came to the university in late April as part of a one-year research appointment in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences.  Meanwhile, since the United States is home to the largest number of Chinese students studying abroad-about 330,000 last year, according to the US Student and Exchange Visitor Program-yet many of them are naive to the possible dangers they may encounter.  Zhang's case should prompt the authorities in both countries to enhance Chinese students' safety awareness when they go to study overseas.         "
China-Thailand rail deal will also benefit region,7/13/2017,"                              People walk at Hua Lamphong Station in Bangkok, Thailand, Sept 21, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]    There's no gain without pain, as the saying goes, and that's certainly been true of the China-Thailand high-speed railway, which has found its way strewn with obstacles before the first phase finally got the green light to go ahead on Tuesday.    After years of delay, Thailand's Cabinet finally approved $5.2 billion in funds to build a 252-kilometer railway that will cut the travel time between the Thai capital and its northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima from the nearly six hours it takes now to less than one and a half hours when it is completed in 2021.  According to the deal, Thai companies will be responsible for construction of the railway, due to start in September, while Chinese enterprises will design it, advise on its construction and provide technology and technical training, among other things.  With a maximum speed of 250 km per hour, the railway will help facilitate Thailand's trade and investment, and attract more tourists. More important, it will help restore the confidence of foreign investors after years of political turmoil in the country. The Thai economy has already rebounded after a decade of slowdown, with growth expected to reach 3.4 percent this year, but the railway project will further propel that good momentum.  The second phase of the project will see the railway extend from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai, across the Mekong River from Vientiane, capital of Laos, paving the way for a railway from Kunming, capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province, to Bangkok, and finally to Singapore.  The two sides first agreed to build the railway in Thailand as early as in 2010. That it has taken so long for the project to finally be put on track, after Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha invoked an executive order last month to clear the legal and political hurdles standing in the way, speaks of the need for China to better communicate the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative to all members of society in countries along the new Silk Road routes.  There were disagreements on costs, loan interest rates and labor rules, but failure to kick-start the infrastructure project earlier was mainly due to the concerns among Thais about how much ordinary people would benefit from the railway.  However, both countries believe that their and the region's economic development potential will be further boosted by the railway, which will serve to promote the construction of a trans-Asian high-speed railway network.  And it shows that China and countries in the region are willing to join hands to create a favorable trade and investment environment from which all can benefit.               "
Seizure of Mosul far from final triumph over terrorism,7/12/2017,"                              Iraqi soldiers attend a celebration for liberation of Mosul in Mosul, Iraq, July 10, 2017. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Monday formally declared Mosul liberated from Islamic State (IS) militant group after nine months of fierce fighting to dislodge the extremist militants from their last major stronghold in Iraq. [Photo/Xinhua]    On Sunday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory in the fight to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State, after a nearly nine-month battle to retake the city, which was captured by the terrorist group three years ago.    After Mosul, Raqqa in Syria is the last major stronghold of the IS terrorists in the Middle East, and there is growing optimism that forces in Syria will soon regain control of that city.  But while these developments signal significant progress is being made in the international efforts to combat the extremist organization, there can be no room for complacency. IS may have lost Mosul and soon lose Raqqa, but it still controls areas in both countries in which it can regroup. Some of the jihadists may also flee to other countries, where they will pose a severe security threat.  Countries around the world, especially those that have been the victims of terrorist attacks before, should step up security measures to preempt revenge attacks by IS sympathizers and be on high alert to dispersed IS fighters trying to enter them.  Indeed, there is still a long way to go before the world can claim final victory against IS. Even when the group does finally fall, the world will need to be prepared for what will happen next, as internationally the threat of terrorism, although diminished, will still exist.  Iraq and Syria will have to restore stability and address the social and political divisions that have fueled the rise of IS, and countries outside the region need to reflect on the intervention that caused the chaos in which IS was able to take root.  After waging a war that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, the United States failed to foster an inclusive government in Iraq. As a result, the country plunged into factional war and chaos. Meanwhile, turmoil and anarchy have reigned in Syria since Western countries tried to instigate regime change in the country.  The IS group thrived by seizing the opportunity that the chaos presented in these two countries. Its success prompted other terrorist groups to pledge allegiance to it, extending its influence beyond the region, and it has posed the biggest security threat to the world in recent years.  As well as stability in region, the international community needs to forge closer security cooperation to win the fight against IS and other terrorist groups. It also needs to find a way to counter the jihadist ideology that has attracted young Muslims in many countries who have been left on the fringes of society.               "
Heritage sites at risk from over exploitation,7/11/2017,"                              Photo taken on Dec 1, 2016 shows a wild yak in Hoh Xil of Northwest China's Qinghai province. The 41th session of the World Heritage Committee on July 7, 2017 decided to put China's Qinghai Hoh Xil on the prestigious World Heritage List as a natural site. [Photo/Xinhua]    With the inclusion of Gulangyu Island, called Kulangsu in the local dialect and known for its well-preserved historical buildings, and Hol Xil, a plateau famous for its natural beauty and biodiversity, China now has 52 sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, which was established to safeguard unique and irreplaceable cultural and natural sites around the world.    The decisions, announced on the weekend, should not only be seen as another reason for the Chinese people to take pride in their history and culture, but also a reason to take pride in the conservation efforts that enabled these two sites to meet the selection criteria. Their inclusion means only Italy, with 53, has more sites on the list.  This feat has not been easy, given that China only became a signatory to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1985, and each country is allowed to nominate only two sites each year.  Behind the successful bids to get the 52 sites inscribed on the list have been strenuous government efforts to protect the nation's natural, historical and cultural heritages, which have been under threat during the country's rapid development.  Take Hol Xil for example, the government established a nature reserve on the plateau in Qinghai province in 1997, in order to protect its fragile ecosystem and combat the rampant poaching of the endangered Tibetan antelope, whose numbers have recovered from 15,000 in 1998 to 60,000 today.  Yet unfortunately, many sites in China already inscribed on UNESCO's heritage list are facing increasing threats from commercialism and lack of adequate protection as local officials see them only as a major source of tourism revenues.  To accommodate the influx of tourists, hotels and infrastructure facilities are being built in some sites, many with safety hazards and at the cost of the local people's traditional lifestyles. Fires in 2013 and 2014, for example, caused irreversible damage to the old town of Lijiang, a cultural site in Yunnan province.  China's increasing number of heritage sites makes it imperative that the country improve its preservation capabilities, in terms of heritage site management and its legal framework, to better protect its rich natural and cultural resources.  Yet a country's World Heritage sites, which exhibit the best of its natural beauty, human values and cultural traditions, belong to all humankind, and it is the responsibility of not only the government, but every citizen to ensure they can be enjoyed by future generations.

India should not expect China to compromise,7/10/2017,"                              Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he addresses the nation from the historic Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations in Delhi, India, August 15, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]    Ever since India sent its troops across the Sikkim section of the border into Donglang area of China on June 18, sparking a tense face-off between soldiers of the two countries, no progress has been made in dissolving the tensions.    One of the arguments that India has used to justify its troops illegally crossing the delimited Sikkim section of the China-India boundary, which is mutually recognized by the two sides, is that it claims the area where China is constructing a road belongs to Bhutan, with whom it has a friendship treaty.  However, although the boundary is yet to be demarcated officially, China and Bhutan have a basic consensus on the boundary alignment, and China has been strictly observing this. Its road building activities do not breach any agreement with the country or undermine the status quo.  Indeed, it is India that is making an issue of Donglang, so as to hold back the China-Bhutan boundary negotiations. And it is the illegal crossing of Indian troops into China's territory that has changed the status quo.  Another of India's arguments is that the Chinese road construction carries ""serious security implications"" for it. India fears that if China completes the road, it could facilitate a possible Chinese attack on the narrow strip of land that connects India's northeast states with its mainland.  This is ridiculous. And no country can pursue its security at the cost of another country's sovereignty.  And since, India, the United States and Japan have begun their 10-day Malabar naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal, which are the biggest of their kind so far, and the US approved a $365-million sale of military transport aircraft to India last week and a $2-billion deal for surveillance drones is in the works, it is China that should feel ""security concerns"", given the importance of the Indian Ocean for its trade and oil imports.  So far, China has exercised the utmost restraint and sought to achieve a peaceful solution through diplomatic means, but New Delhi should realize Beijing will not make any compromises when it comes to its territorial integrity.  India should withdraw all of its troops that have crossed the delimited boundary back to its own side, a move that is essentially different from the previous standoffs between the border troops of the two countries in undefined areas. This has undermined the political basis for bilateral relations.  India should respect the provisions in the boundary convention, before the situation deteriorates and leads to more serious consequences.               "
Better world economy needs concerted cooperation,7/7/2017,"                                    President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and President of the European Council Donald Tusk attend a Press conference after a meeting of European Union leaders at the Chancellery on June 29, 2017 in Berlin, Germany. [Photo/VCG]      At the G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou last year, the leaders of major industrialized and developing countries reached a consensus that they would play a leading role in pushing for more inclusive and sustainable global growth, further liberalize trade and investment, and strive to improve global governance.  Now, as the leaders gather in Hamburg, Germany, for their summit on Friday and Saturday, they should be prepared to find practical ways to achieve those objectives, as the world urgently needs effective solutions to many pressing challenges.  Not least the fact that global growth remains obstinately sluggish and unbalanced nine years after the onset of the devastating global financial crisis, with policymakers in developed economies and developing nations alike struggling with growing debt, currency fluctuations, and the adverse effects of capital flows. Even worse, anti-globalization and populist sentiment have become more evident in many countries.  Germany, the host of this year's G20 Summit, is a firm champion of free trade and investment and it has taken the lead in combating the anti-globalization wave in Europe. And as the current chair of the G20, it can seek to guide those attending the meeting to bridge their differences and push forward the implementation of the global agenda as agreed.  China, as the largest developing country and the most important contributor to global growth, is offering Germany its full support in this endeavor. Meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, President Xi Jinping said China appreciates Germany upholding the consensus reached in Hangzhou, and promised China's support so the meeting in Hamburg can achieve positive results.  With the two countries playing an exemplary role in striving to advance the necessary global agenda, it is hoped that other countries will join hands to work out feasible and effective remedies for the world's ills.  The United States, as the world's largest economy and its most important financial power, should not relinquish its responsibility to help ensure the global economy recovers its health. In an interconnected world, protectionism and isolation will not reduce the US' own economic woes, but rather risk its own economic strength and undermine its credibility as the world's leader.  The world is undergoing profound changes and major adjustments. As the premier forum for dialogue, communication and coordination among the world' s major economies, the G20 can lead the way forward by delivering on the consensus agreed in Hangzhou and promoting the trends of multi-polarity, globalization and sustainability.

China-Germany ties a model for cooperation,7/6/2017,"                                    President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan are greeted upon their arrival in Berlin, Germany, July 4, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      President Xi Jinping's on-going state visit to Germany, which coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Germany, is expected to not only lift bilateral ties to a new level, but also help revive the trend of globalization and trade liberalization.  With the world facing growing uncertainties, the cooperation between China and Germany has assumed global significance, as greater interaction between the two countries will give a shot in the arm not only to China's relationship with Europe as a whole, but also the global economy.  Over the years, China and Germany have set up more than 70 dialogue and cooperation mechanisms covering a wide range of fields, and, thanks to their joint efforts, their practical cooperation is now ""robust"", as Xi noted on his arrival, and it plays an exemplary role in boosting Europe's cooperation with China.  Prior to his arrival in Berlin, Xi paid a state visit to Russia, where he met with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. One eye-catching similarity in China's interaction with Russia and Germany in recent years has been the frequency of the high-level contacts and exchanges, which have helped boost trust and cooperation.  And thanks to this, China's relationships with Germany and Russia are in very good shape. Given that Xi is also scheduled to attend the upcoming G20 Summit in Hamburg on Friday and Saturday, his meetings with the leaders of Russia and Germany have provided a good opportunity for China to better coordinate its stance with the two important G20 members, paving the way for the summit to achieve people's hopes for positive outcomes and the injection of fresh impetus into global growth.  As Xi rightfully pointed out at the 2017 World Economic Forum at Davos earlier this year, economic globalization is a double-edged sword. But despite globalization encountering difficulties, countries around the world should work together to counter protectionism and seize every opportunity to promote growth through innovation and structural reforms.  The G20, as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, can forge a shared will to achieve these aims by following through on the consensus achieved last September at the G20 Hangzhou Summit, when participants agreed to make significant contributions to promoting strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive global growth.  In this respect, China and Germany, as the previous and current G20 chair, shoulder the important responsibility of ensuring the Hamburg summit delivers on the vision and spirit of partnership it displayed then.

"India should respect border agreement, withdraw troops",7/5/2017,"                      More than two weeks after India sent troops across the Sikkim border into China to obstruct construction of a road by the People's Liberation Army in the Donglong region, the situation there remains worryingly tense, with a stand-off between soldiers of the two countries still ongoing.   That the situation has not flared out of control is thanks to the great restraint exercised by the Chinese troops. But the tensions resulting from the intrusion will surely grow if there is not a total withdrawal of the Indian troops.   Unlike previous incidents that have occurred along other parts of the 3,500-kilometer border between China and India, the latest incident happened at a section that has long been demarcated by an 1890 historical convention and reaffirmed in documents exchanged between successive Chinese and Indian governments since then.   The transgression by Indian troops therefore violates that convention and the basic norms that guide international relations. China has made it explicitly clear that it is ""unwavering"" in its resolve to uphold its territorial integrity and will take whatever measures it deems necessary to do so.   India may be trying to make a point. It is reportedly worried that the Chinese road construction may represent a significant change in the status quo with serious security implications for India, according to its foreign ministry.   But such worries could have been allayed through dialogue and consultation using the mechanisms that are already in place and which have long helped the two sides maintain peace and tranquility in the region since their short border war in 1962.   Yet instead of calls for talks, what we hear is clamor for war by the Indian military, with its Army Chief General Bipin Rawat declaring recently that India ""was ready for a two-and-a-half front war (China, Pakistan and internal security)"", and its Defense Minister Arun Jaitley saying that the India of 2017 was not the India of 1962.   Perhaps its defeat in that war was too humiliating for some in the Indian military and that is why they are talking belligerently this time.   And doubtlessly such irresponsible acts and rhetoric reflect the ""strategic anxiety"" over China's rise harbored by some Indian politicians and their apprehensions about the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.   Yet as Chinese officials have emphasized on many occasions, the initiative aims to promote economic cooperation and connectivity and has no bearing on sovereignty issues. There is no need for India to be sensitive about the initiative.   The trespassing by the Indian troops runs counter to the Indian government's longstanding and rightful position. It should respect China's territorial integrity and withdraw its troops back across the border.               "
US destroyer's intrusion into Chinese waters unacceptable,7/4/2017,"                              [Photo/Ye Yongxia]      The Foreign Ministry has called the trespassing of a US missile destroyer in China's territorial waters a ""serious political and military provocation"", and the Ministry of National Defense said the move has seriously undermined the strategic mutual trust between the two militaries.  Such a response drives home the message that the United States is solely responsible for raising tensions between the two militaries and casting a shadow over bilateral ties.  In the second ""freedom of navigation"" operation conducted by the US Navy since US President Donald Trump took office, the missile destroyer USS Stethem trespassed in China's territorial waters off the Xisha Islands on Sunday.  Compared with such operations under the previous US administration, the one conducted on Sunday is particularly alarming as it took place in waters where territorial disputes do not exist.  The Xisha Islands are an inherent part of Chinese territory. The Chinese government promulgated the baseline of the territorial sea off the islands in 1996, and the relevant Chinese law has explicit provisions regarding foreign military vessels' entering China's territorial waters.  The US Navy cannot pretend these long established facts do not exist. Its blatant act constitutes a serious infringement on China's sovereignty.  It also threatens to undermine the current hard-won trend of cooperation in the South China Sea, which has resulted in China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations completing the drafting of a framework for a code of conduct.  The latest provocation shows Trump is yet to discard the strategy of stirring up confrontation in the South China Sea adopted by his predecessor. Such a practice is both dangerous and counterproductive because it could easily throw China-US relations off balance and squander the fruitful results achieved so far in advancing bilateral cooperation.  President Xi Jinping and Trump reached an important consensus when they met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April, and since then mutual efforts have been made to forge a constructive partnership.  But against that general rosy picture of bilateral cooperation, there have been increasing undercurrents of late, and these prompted Xi to say in a telephone conversation with Trump on Monday that bilateral ties are being affected by some negative factors.  Xi told Trump that China and the US should stick to the principles of mutual respect and reciprocity, concentrate on cooperation and manage and control their differences. This points the way for both sides to anchor bilateral ties on stable terrain.  After all, without accommodating each other's core interests and major concerns, the foundations for nation-to-nation ties will be anything but solid.         "
It is unwise for Washington to play the Taiwan card,7/3/2017,"                      The past week was nothing but eventful considering the relative peace China-US relations have enjoyed since Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump struck a constructive note for bilateral ties when they met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April.  Over the past few days, Washington has approved a $1.4-billion arms sale to Taiwan and blacklisted a Chinese bank for alleged business ties with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the US Senate Armed Services Committee has approved a bill for US naval vessels to make regular stops at Taiwan ports and help the island develop undersea warfare capabilities.  The moves run counter to the consensus reached by the two presidents on that occasion that the two countries should work together to forge a constructive partnership.  Although the approval of the arms sales to Taiwan agreed last year is the most provocative move the Trump administration has taken thus far, it is actually the latest act of a decades-old routine stemming from the US Defense Authorization Act. It is hardly a novelty in bilateral ties, and is only surprising because of its timing, scale and the technologies involved.  The proposed port visits are another matter, should they gain the approval of Congress and the authorization of the president, the consequences for ties are likely to be extremely serious, because besides sending a misleading message to the secessionist forces in Taiwan, they would constitute a substantial infringement on China's sovereignty.  Washington is well aware that Beijing will not tolerate any external interference in its internal affairs, especially any challenge to the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Something Xi spelled out very clearly during his just-concluded visit to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  At this stage, the moves made last week are nothing more than annoying, and they do not necessarily measure up to a reversal in the US' China policies as some are claiming.  It may be the outcome-oriented Washington is anxious to leverage immediate gains from bilateral collaboration in relation to priority issues on its agenda or a price-hiking ploy prior to negotiations at the upcoming Comprehensive Economic Dialogue. Either way, going overboard in trying to put pressure on Beijing may prove counterproductive, since it will simply prompt a tit-for-tat response from which the US will not emerge unbruised.  Beijing, protesting against the moves, has called on Washington to correct its mistakes so that their cooperation on major issues will not be affected, showing the constructive partnership they have pledged to formulate is still attainable if there is a shared will.

Party rides on dynamism to realize Chinese Dream,7/1/2017,"                      With the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China approaching, all eyes are focused on the country and the Party, because the international community has been wondering how China under the leadership of the Party has maintained sustainable growth despite the weak world economic recovery.  The answer lies in the dynamism and evolution of the Party, which have been on display throughout its history, especially since 2012 when the new Party leadership assumed office.  As the CPC observes the 96th anniversary of its founding on Saturday, it can pride itself for lifting the world's most populous country out of poverty and making it the world's second-largest economy in three decades through reform and opening-up.  The Party with about 89 million members is now committed to building a community of shared destiny, providing the vision for a better future for humankind.  The painful memory of the setbacks, some costly, in the pursuit of national independence and subsequent rejuvenation of the Chinese nation consolidated the Party's belief that only through down-to-earth pragmatism can it make China self-reliant in all spheres.  It is owing to this belief that the Party has never wavered in its goal of leading China on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. By responding well to the people's needs and cultivating efficient and capable officials, the Party has shown tremendous governance stability and efficiency which have helped the country continue on the path of economic and social development despite international uncertainties.  Self-correction is the other source of that stability and efficiency. In this regard, the anti-corruption campaign intensified since 2012 and the strengthening of Party discipline have made the Party stronger.  The continuous development of the theory of socialism has not only infused new vitality into the Party but also attracted many new members. More important, it has allowed the Party leadership with Xi Jinping as its core to give shape to its global vision.  And this global vision is perfectly demonstrated in the China-led Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as it will allow the country to share its wisdom and development dividends with the rest of the world to promote inclusive global economic growth and help build a fairer world order.  China is closer to achieving the great goal of national rejuvenation today than at any other time in history. As long as the CPC stays true to its mission, and puts people first, nothing can stop it from realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.         "
Xi's pledge of full support will help build better Hong Kong,6/30/2017,"                                    President Xi Jinping and first lady Peng Liyuan arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Thursday. Xi is making a three-day visit. EDMOND TANG / FOR CHINA DAILY      President Xi Jinping arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday for a three-day visit to the special administrative region, during which he will take part in celebratory activities to mark the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland and swear in the SAR's new leadership team.  Speaking at the airport on his arrival, Xi said that, as well as bringing the mainland's blessings to Hong Kong, he also came to convey the central government's unwavering support for the SAR's development, and to help the SAR plan for its future.  Beijing's strong support for Hong Kong has been consistent and evident over the past two decades. And before Xi arrived, the central government sent the SAR a valuable gift on Wednesday-further expansion of the 13-year-old Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement to cover nonservice industries on the mainland.  The plan to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area was formally announced earlier this year. And it is expected that a Bond Connect program will also be put into place in the near future.  Such substantial measures show that the central government has Hong Kong's best interests at heart.  And, on a more personal note, Xi said in his remarks on Thursday that Hong Kong always tugs at his heartstrings. The last time he set foot on Hong Kong soil was nine years ago, when he visited the SAR as vice-president. He said he was happy to return and see the changes the city has undergone since then.  But as well as seeing for himself how the city is now, he also looked ahead and pledged to help the SAR plan for the future.  Further integration into the country's overall development strategies is the way forward for the SAR, which has somewhat lost its direction amid the keen competition it has faced in recent years.  The SAR can use its advantages, such as in finance and shipping, as well as the trust it enjoys with investors, to play a vital role in the Belt and Road Initiative.  Seizing the abundant opportunities offered by greater integration with the mainland and its development strategies will serve to enhance the economic development of the SAR and improve the well-being of its residents.  Xi's visit will strengthen Hong Kong's confidence in its future. What anniversary gift could be more precious than that?  It is now Hong Kong's turn to deliver on the goodwill and faith the central government is showing in it.         "
Taiwan leader shows she is out of touch with reality,6/29/2017,"                                 Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan,  April 15, 2015. [Photo/IC]    Slightly more than 13 months in office, the approval rating of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen continues to nosedive, and she faces growing questions about her competency.    It is for the island's own good that its residents are finally waking up to the damage her ""separatist stance"" is doing to the Taiwan economy and are now seeking ways to restore healthy relations with the mainland.   Unfortunately, Tsai and her colleagues who are responsible for this state of affairs and who are in the position to make a difference are still refusing to come to their senses. Instead, they appear even more intent on pressing ahead with what has proven to be so wrong and harmful.   To the rising calls that they reflect on their refusal to uphold the 1992 Consensus, which has proved to be the reliable foundation for cross-Straits rapport, and recognize one China is the precondition for improving ties, Tsai and her team continue to turn a deaf ear.   Not only that, Tsai and a number of her fellow Democratic Progressive Party politicians have expressed the idea that to ""not give in"" is the only way Taiwan can deal with the conundrum they have created.   It is the refusal of Tsai and her party to uphold the one-China principle that has caused the problems, by putting an end to the cross-Straits rapprochement and subsequent ""diplomatic truce"" established by both sides of the Straits when her predecessor Ma Ying-jeou and the Kuomintang were in office.   However, Tsai and her like-minded secessionists are dumping the blame on Beijing - accusing it of squeezing the ""international living space"" for the island, after Panama became the latest country to shift diplomatic recognition to Beijing on June 13.   That accusation is simply unfounded. While their belief that ""as long as Taiwan does not succumb, the mainland will give in"" is out of touch with reality.   As are Tsai's idea to arm the local security forces with self-developed missiles and ""defend"" the island against an ""invasion"" by the mainland, and some die-hard anti-mainland elements' clamor to develop nuclear weapons. Although these could lead to actual conflict and inflict real harm.   By pursuing their fool's paradise with such talk, the ""independence"" seekers on the island are creating a dangerous state of affairs.   The peace and friendly interaction between Taipei and Beijing during the Ma Ying-jeou years showed the 1992 Consensus is the formula for healthy and mutually beneficial relations, and the guarantee for peaceful co-existence. This is something Tsai and her colleagues need to recognize.                   "
Technology and innovation help achieve inclusive growth,6/28/2017,"                              An industrial robot interacts with a participant of the Dalian Summer Davos Annual Meeting at the Dalian International Conference Center in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, June 27, 2017. [Photo by Zhu Xingxin/chinadaily.com.cn]    Artificial intelligence, intelligent robots, e-commerce, big data: These are some of the technological advancements in the ongoing new industrial revolution that are profoundly changing our lives.    As Premier Li Keqiang remarked in his opening speech at the 11th Annual Meeting of the New Champions on Tuesday, farmers in China's remote mountainous areas can now see their specialty products reach urban consumers in just one or two days, and at prices several times higher than if they were sold locally-all thanks to the booming online trading platforms and express delivery networks that have emerged in recent years.  Li used this as an example to highlight how technology and innovation can accelerate more inclusive economic growth, featuring meaningful job creation and sustainable development, a main theme of the three-day meeting, known as the Summer Davos, which is being held in the coastal city of Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province.  Indeed China has a lot to share on how jobs can be created by promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. Over the last four to five years, more than 50 million new jobs, or around 10 million annually, have been created in the country, a remarkable achievement of the government's endeavor to promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation, which, as Li said, has seen 14,000 new enterprises registered each day over the past three years.  By helping foster a rapid development of new industries and business models, such as e-commerce, mobile payments and the building of a sharing economy, technology and innovation are playing a key role in China's bid to upgrade and transition its economy to more sustainable growth. China can share that experience with the political and business leaders from other countries attending the meeting.  The new growth momentum not only created 70 percent of all new jobs in the country last year, it also laid a firm foundation for China to realize its growth target of around 6.5 percent for the year.  Such robust economic performance is a boon to the world economy that is still suffering from insufficient recovery momentum.  And as Li noted in his speech, the Chinese economy will bring more opportunities to the world and continue to be a magnet for foreign investment as it further opens up.  This, together with his pledge to give foreign and Chinese businesses fair and equal treatment, will surely contribute to global inclusive growth if, as he urged, countries seek convergent interests and complement each other's advantages.

Fight against drugs is a shared responsibility,6/27/2017,"                             China Daily cartoon    Despite worldwide actions to combat drug trafficking and use, the problem is relentlessly worsening, with international drug cartels becoming more aggressive in expanding their markets and terrorists funding their activities with the production and sale of traditional narcotics.    The annual International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, which fell on Monday, is intended to highlight the connections between drugs, crime and terrorism, and raise awareness of the severe impacts that illicit drugs have not only on people's health and the well-being of families and communities, but also on peace and stability.  It also served as a timely reminder of the severe challenge China faces in its fight against drugs.  As in previous years, police seizures of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines were destroyed, and convicted drug traffickers executed as a demonstration of the government's determination to build a society free of drug abuse.  Yet despite that resolve, the figures make for grim reading.  As of the end of 2016, China had about 2.5 million registered drug users, an increase of 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to a report released by the National Narcotics Control Commission in March.  And the main victims of drugs are young people who are tempted to try drugs for fun and end up being ensnared by them. Although the number of drug users under 18 almost halved in 2016, largely due to government efforts in raising awareness among students about the dangers of drugs, the majority of new users are aged between 18 and 35. Adept at using the internet, they have created a new challenge as illegal transactions are increasingly conducted in the virtual world, making it even more difficult for police to track down drug dealers.  And China faces a particularly tough challenge in combating drug trafficking as it sits close to two of the world's most notorious drug-producing regions. To its south is the ""Golden Triangle"", which once produced half of the world's opiates and is now famous for its vibrant methamphetamine trade. To the west is the ""Golden Crescent"" which includes Afghanistan, a country that accounts for 85 percent of the world's non-pharmaceutical grade poppy production, according to the World Drug Report 2017 produced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  All this calls for enhanced communication and cooperation between China and its neighbors to combat drug trafficking, and continued efforts to raise the awareness of young people about the risks of drugs, including new psychoactive substances.  It is a shared responsibility of all countries to fight drug related crimes, and a shared responsibility of society to ensure young people can say no to drugs.           "
Down-to-earth endeavors key to poverty alleviation goal,6/25/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping meets with local villagers at Songjiagou New Village, a centralized resettlement site under the approach of alleviating poverty through relocation, in Kelan county of Xinzhou city, North China's Shanxi province, June 21, 2017. Xi had a three-day inspection tour in Shanxi from Wednesday. [Photo/Xinhua]    Setting a deadline for eradicating poverty requires confidence; especially, setting a very short one for eliminating ""abject poverty"".    However, the country has a proud record in poverty alleviation in the past more than three decades, which has given the current Communist Party of China leadership the confidence to set the deadline to eliminate any enduring poverty by 2020,ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2021.   President Xi Jinping's remarks on poverty alleviation on Friday show the CPC leadership is not only confident of achieving that goal, but also well aware of what needs to be done to lift the remaining about 40 million rural villagers out of abject poverty in the next three years.   As Xi pointed out, most of the poverty-stricken villagers now reside in very underdeveloped areas, where the ecological environment is fragile, natural disasters occur frequently, the proportion of destitute rural residents is very high and the local collective economy is weak. As a result, the task ahead is extremely tough and demanding.  It is not just inputs of both financial support and human resources by local governments that will enable these villagers to escape poverty, but also the way such inputs are distributed and used. That explains why targeted poverty alleviation measures have been emphasized.   What is particularly important, as Xi emphasized in his speech, is that the poverty alleviation targets for local governments must be realistic, based on local realities and local conditions. Specifically, the rural poor should no longer have to worry about safe shelter, food and clothing, their children's education and basic healthcare services.  The new emphasis placed on precision — taking the right measures, at the right time, in the right way — will add to the efficiency of specific relief efforts. But the introduction of the strictest report and supervision mechanism that Xi is initiating to prevent corruption and fraud, and his call for an enhanced support system of upgraded infrastructure and improved public services, will make the difference in efforts to ensure those rural residents still struggling to shake off poverty can do so.  A long-term support system is essential in this regard since poverty alleviation achievements in some localities have proven fragile in the past, as there have been cases where people have slid back in poverty due to sudden illness or their efforts to meet the burden of children's education expenses.   Translating Xi's proposals for better support and more effective measures into down-to-earth endeavors at the grassroots level is the guarantee for conquering the stubborn residual poverty in the country.                  "
China-US dialogue displays shared will to work together,6/23/2017,"                              US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis meet with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of the People's Liberation Army's Joint Staff Department prior to the US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue at the State Department in Washington, US, June 21, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      The Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea, terrorism, military-to-military cooperation ... the list goes on.  Any of such topics of bilateral, regional and global concern raised at the table of the maiden China-US Diplomatic and Security Dialogue could have consumed the daylong session. Especially, the Korean Peninsula issue, as the tragic death of Otto Warmbier added fuel to public outrage at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, raising concerns the dialogue might get mired in who is to do what next.  Such worries proved unfounded, however. And the opening installment of the brand-new mechanism of China-US engagement was successful, sustaining the constructive atmosphere from the summit between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in early April, and adding optimism to the three other components-economic, law enforcement and cybersecurity, and social and culture-of the China-US Comprehensive Dialogue.  Beijing and Washington have plenty of thorny, pressing tasks at hand, many of which can't be accomplished without both being involved, and committed simultaneously. That Xi and Trump seem to get along well and China-US relations have so far fared well in the Trump era are reassuring signs that essential lessons about this particular relationship have been learned.  Many longstanding issues keep haunting China-US relations not because Beijing and Washington lack the wisdom, or tools to resolve them, but because they are lacking the mutual trust and political will to work together.  It would certainly be misleading to assume Beijing and Washington will be happy together hereafter, though both pledged goodwill and collaboration. However, considering the arduous job of forging mutual trust, there was nothing more to expect from Wednesday's dialogue. And, at the end of the day, what truly matters is their consensus to manage and control their differences on the basis of mutual respect.  In fairness to both parties, Beijing and Washington have made attempts to jointly handle issues of common concern, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But more often than not, they keep getting ensnared in their differences at critical junctures.  Such a state of affairs may be understandable between a rising power and an incumbent one, which is how China and the US are portrayed in the age-old framework of a big-power struggle.  So the diplomatic pragmatism the Chinese and US leaders have demonstrated so far is welcome as it may usher in more benign interaction that cultivates goodwill via case-specific collaboration. For their interests are not intrinsically contradictory, it is their mutual suspicions that they need to overcome.  The latest dialogue just affirmed their shared will to try and do so.         "
MSCI signals investors have confidence in Chinese market,6/22/2017,"                              Investors look at computer screens showing stock information at a brokerage in Shanghai, August 13, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]      Global stock indexes provider MSCI's announcement on Tuesday that it will include 222 large Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies into its widely followed Emerging Markets Index is a welcome move that caters to the needs of international investors and reflects their rising confidence in the Chinese economy.  Given that MSCI has more than $10 trillion worth of active and passive assets benchmarked against it, with $2 trillion tracking the Emerging Markets Index alone, the inclusion will surely buoy up the bearish Chinese domestic market in the long run.  This has not come easy, as MSCI has excluded Chinese mainland shares for three years in a row, citing China's restrictions on market access and on capital flows in and out of the country.  Yet with a valuation of more than $6 trillion, the Chinese mainland market now accounts for more than 10 percent of capitalization of the global equity market, so excluding domestically-traded A-shares from the index has made it at best incomplete, if not misleading.  The MSCI's decision to finally include them is recognition of the rapid progress China has made in making its stock markets more accessible to foreign investors, something that the index provider previously cited as a major concern.  Besides the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program, China has, since late 2014, launched Stock Connects, that give foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong. Though the quotas available are yet to expand, the Stock Connect program has been a big step forward in improving the accessibility of China's markets, ""a game changer for the market opening of China A-shares,"" as Remy Briand, MSCI managing director and chairman of the MSCI Index Policy Committee, said in the news release announcing their inclusion in its index.  As part of China's moves to make companies more market-oriented and governed by law, new rules have also been put in place to regulate stock trading suspensions, a major issue when hundreds of companies halted their trading during a market crash in 2015.  Such measures have won broad support from international institutional investors.  Yet it is unrealistic to expect the MSCI inclusion will usher in a bull market for China. MSCI expects initial inflows following the inclusion of Chinese shares will be around $17 billion, a negligible amount compared with China's total market capitalization.  To make the Chinese market truly attractive, a lot more needs to be done to improve corporate governance.  The MSCI's inclusion of Chinese shares in its index should be the start of moves in that direction.         "
Reform in financial sector imperative for progress,6/21/2017,"                              A bank clerk tells a customer how to use the mobile banking services at a bank in Nantong, Jiangsu province, Sept 21, 2016. [Photo/VCG]      Healthy financial institutions are a prerequisite for preventing a financial crisis, as central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan rightly pointed out at this year's Lujiazui financial forum in Shanghai on Tuesday.  Zhou made the comment while encouraging broader and longer-term financial opening-up.  The country faces a variety of challenges in its financial sector, so the emphasis on greater government efforts to advance reforms is welcome, as in this way the country will be better able to preempt a crisis stemming from its financial risks.  In the Government Work Report he delivered to the 12th National People's Congress in March, Premier Li Keqiang issued a strongly worded statement cautioning that strict vigilance was needed to guard against the financial risks accumulated through nonperforming loans, bond defaults, shadow banking, internet-based financial services and other instruments.  The financial sector has made many attempts at financial innovation and reform in recent years, such as in the field of internet-based finance. But regrettably, some of the many internet-based financial platforms that rapidly appeared turned out to be ""financial bloodsuckers"" engaged in illegal fundraising.  Also in the wake of the stock market debacles since the summer of 2015, investigations have revealed the murky connections between officials from the regulatory commission and the staff of securities companies, who joined hands to manipulate stock prices to the benefit of a few insiders.  Another major challenge the country faces is its high level of corporate debt. Although some international agencies have warned that China suffers from dangerously high debt levels, the fact is that China's government debts remain affordable. What is worrying is the debt on the corporate side. However, as China is ""deleveraging"" its economy, hopefully the corporate debt risk will gradually be reduced-in the same way that China is resolving the problem of its local government debt.  All these issues are symptoms of the financial sector's ill health, and policymakers must make more efforts to clean up and strengthen management in financial sector to remedy the risks.  One of the major tasks facing the government at present is to accelerate innovation and reform to equip the country's financial institutions with modern corporate governance structures; likewise, the growing number of State-owned financial enterprises with a presence in global financial arena need more modern management to be competitive.  To ensure the resilience and well-being of the financial sector, reform and innovation should not stop, as Wang Zhaoxing, vice-chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, emphasized at Tuesday's forum.

Greater efforts needed to nurture innovation,6/20/2017,"                              Composite photo taken on June 15, 2017 shows a quantum communication ground station in Urumqi, capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. [Photo/Xinhua]      From a quantum communication satellite to methane hydrate gas extraction, a large passenger jet, aircraft carriers, and the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, never have this country's technological breakthroughs been announced with such high frequency in recent memory.  As if to corroborate the country's newfound pride in its innovative prowess, in this year's Global Innovation Index, an annual report on major world economic entities' innovativeness compiled by Cornell University, INSEAD business school and the World Intellectual Property Organization, China climbed three places, from 25th in 2016 to 22nd.  Experts at home have been quick to credit the progress to the government's recent emphasis on innovation-driven growth. And despite the complaints about bureaucratic red tape, low efficiency and the misuse of funds, decades of generous government inputs in technological advancement have paid off.  But it would be misleading to assume government policy orientations can always work magic, especially when it comes to technological innovations. The barely three-year-old highlight on mass innovation, although conducive to an innovation-friendly environment, has come after the inputs that led to the key technological breakthroughs we are reaping now.  Innovativeness entails a lot more than government willingness to spend more on technological progress. While the 2017 innovation index does see improvements in the performance in such fields as mechanisms, human capital and research, infrastructure, and knowledge and technology output, the nation still has a very long list of things to do to cultivate the potential of indigenous innovation. Reforming the obsolete management systems and appraisal mechanisms, and creating a talent-friendly research and development regime are pressing yet continually neglected tasks hindering the progress toward greater innovativeness.  And as President Xi Jinping has said, scientists need to be given more room to decide upon the direction of their research and greater management of research funds and resources, so they can explore and test the hypotheses they put forward.  In fairness to the authorities, we have witnessed increased awareness of intellectual property rights as well as government attempts to offer better protection of research achievements. But inadequate respect and protection remain outstanding obstacles to innovation in this country, which may prevent us from becoming a real innovation powerhouse as we wish, at least in the foreseeable future.  And the cultivation of innovativeness should never be considered a process that begins in research labs. It also calls for an all-round review, and subsequent reform, of our national education, from curriculum design to classroom instruction, from kindergartens to institutions of higher learning, so as to foster inquisitive minds.

Australia's groundswell of bias counterproductive,6/19/2017,"                              Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reacts as he arrives in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia June 15, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    That Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull labeled China a ""frenemy"" at an event last year was leaked by Australia's Fairfax Media on Friday shows some in Australia are intent on trying to disrupt the generally rosy picture of bilateral cooperation by continuing to whip up anti-China sentiment.    In the past few weeks, Australian media have used unfounded evidence and wild speculation to accuse China of trying to expand its political influence in Australia, trying to ""instigate China panic"" as Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye noted earlier last week.  Turnbull himself has joined the chorus of bias against China, and his speech addressing the Shangri-La Forum in Singapore early this month has been cited as proof he is adopting a tougher stance toward China.  Such a worrying trend has naturally aroused concerns in China and prompted doubts about Canberra's sincerity in promoting meaningful interaction with Beijing. If the trend continues, it will no doubt put a brake on the current good momentum in bilateral cooperation, which will only do a disservice to the interests of both sides.  The current groundswell of China-bashing in Australia stems from those Australians still clinging to an outdated zero-sum mentality, those who have bought into the US' strategy to contain China.  Indeed, it is Australia's role in the US' alliance system in the region that has resulted in it suffering from schizophrenia, since it is finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance between its most important ally on the one hand and its biggest trading partner on the other.  The long-time and deep-running US influence in their country means some narrow-minded Australians and biased media do not want to see China's economic influence in Australia rising.  However, Australian politicians and media need to understand developing a constructive and growing relationship with China, and realizing the opportunities of what Australia itself has identified as the Asian century, serves the best interests of their country and contributes to the stability and development of the region at large.  Right now, the wide global support being offered to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative should help dispel any ill-grounded suspicions it may have of Beijing's strategic intentions in the region and beyond.  The Australian leader should show political wisdom and vision by playing his part in building an objective and fair public perception of China in his country, which is the essential foundation for bilateral ties to grow healthily and exert a positive influence on regional peace and development.                  "
China can cope with any US rate hike turbulence,6/16/2017,"                              US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference in Washington DC, June 14, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    The interest rate hike announced by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday has so far failed to produce a major ripple effect in emerging market economies. Policymakers in these countries, however, should continue to remain alert over the accumulative effects of future US interest rate hikes and balance sheet cuts.    The Fed decided to raise the benchmark interest rates to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent on Wednesday and hinted at another rise later this year.  Although stock markets fell in the wake of the Fed's announcement, the falls were generally mild, reflecting that the decision had already been well priced in. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index even rose slightly on Thursday trading.  However, the hike, the third in seven months, together with the hint by Fed chair Janet Yellen that the Fed may begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year, has triggered market expectations that the Fed may speed up the pace of policy normalization, at a rate of three or four hikes a year through 2019.  If that happens, the changing interest rate gaps between the United States and other countries would inevitably lead to significant amounts of international capital flowing out of the developing and emerging market economies and into the US. And the balance sheet cuts by the Fed, if carried out, would have repercussions for the global financial markets, reminiscent of the ""taper tantrum"" in 2013.  Therefore, the worst is yet to come for the world economy if the US keeps the current tempo of financial policy tightening or even accelerates it.  Policymakers in other countries certainly can opt to follow suit to minimize the effect of the US moves on their economy. But many face a dilemma since raising interest rates would jeopardize the corporate sector and cool their economy.  China faces the same problem. But reassuringly, Chinese policymakers acted early to tighten regulation of the financial sector to reduce financial risks and prevent any exigency.  So far, the Chinese economy remains sound, with its first-quarter GDP growth at 6.9 percent, laying a solid foundation for it to achieve its growth target of at least 6.5 percent this year. The May macroeconomic data also showed that industrial production and retail sales have increased steadily and job creation remains solid.  The stable trend of resilient growth means China will, in the worst-case scenario, be capable of combating financial turbulences triggered by abnormal global capital flows as a result of the US' rate hikes and balance sheet cuts.

Collusion of dupes seeks to pursue 'independence',6/15/2017,"                              Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan,on April 15, 2015. [Photo/IC]    About 20 members of Taiwan's ""legislative yuan"" launched on Monday a ""platform"" in Taipei designed to connect ""pro-democracy"" groups in Taiwan with their ""allies"" in Hong Kong in the name of promoting democracy in both places against ""suppression"" by Beijing.    Not surprisingly five men representing the opposition camp in Hong Kong, including three ""pan-democrat"" members of the Legislative Council and two leaders of radical student organizations, were on hand to seal the deal, widely seen as a token of defiance to the overwhelming support for national reunification, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country.  Obviously they did their best to omit any perceivable link to separatist or secessionist ideas in the paperwork for their cross-regional alliance, but people familiar with the political situations in Taiwan and Hong Kong have no problem understanding why they have publicly come together at this juncture.  The Taiwan side in this marriage of convenience is led by the New Power Party, which is as ""pro-independence"" as they come; while the Hong Kong side is well-known for its dubious label of ""localist self-determination"", which of course embraces ""independence"".  The NPP rode the Sunflower Student Movement of March 2014 to prominence while some of its Hong Kong allies are poster boys of the illegal Occupy Central movement, also known as the ""umbrella revolution"". But their media stardom came at the expense of their local societies' overall interests, and both camps have been experiencing waning public support lately as a result of their highly divisive and destructive political stunts.  The biggest victim of their activities has been democracy itself, as evidenced by the mess that is the ""legislative yuan"" in Taiwan and non-stop filibustering by opposition lawmakers in Hong Kong just so they can undermine the SAR government at all costs in total disregard to people's well-being.  People who believed the Sunflower Movement was all about democracy should have realized by now it was designed to put the ""pro-independence"" Democratic Progressive Party in power. The DPP got what it wanted, but Taiwan's economy and ultimately the local society are now suffering in its name.  Hong Kong, fortunately, has avoided a political disaster like Taiwan's, thanks to the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"", but there are groups funded by foreign governments and forces hostile to China trying everything they can to achieve their aim of declaring it at least an independent political entity. They are sacrificing the city's stability and prosperity and residents' well-being for their doomed and selfish cause.               "
Shrinking space for Tsai to flaunt independence,6/14/2017,"                              Panama's Vice-President and Foreign Minister Isabel de Saint Malo, left, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pose with their documents after signing a joint communique on establishing diplomatic relations during a press briefing in Beijing, June 13, 2017. [Photo/VCG]    Panama's decision on Monday to establish formal diplomatic relations with Beijing and switch its recognition from Taiwan is a welcome move that accords with the historical trend and best serves the national interests of both China and the Central American nation.    Panama is the second country to switch its recognition to Beijing since pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party chief Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan leader last year, following a similar move by Sao Tome and Principe in December.  This, in addition to the World Health Organization's rejection of Taiwan representatives attending its annual conference in May, suggests that the principle of one China is now widely accepted by the international community and the space for Taiwan to continue to flaunt its banner of independence is rapidly shrinking.  Taipei has been pointing an accusing finger at Beijing for persuading Panama, a country with a strategic location that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to break its ties with the island.  A sovereign nation with a quarter of its population living in poverty, Panama has the right to choose its own path of development.  Chinese ships are now the second most frequent users of the Panama Canal, the main source of revenue for Panama, and as China has already been the leading provider of merchandise to a free trade zone in the Panamanian city of Colon, it is natural for the two sides to step up efforts to tap their cooperation potential by establishing formal ties.  That a COSCO freighter from the Chinese mainland was the first vessel to pass through the newly expanded canal in June last year was an indication of their strengthening relationship of mutual benefits, which is bound to prosper further now that Panama is welcome to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative.  Taipei has only itself to blame for what it sees as ""suppression"" of its international space.  Tsai, who likes to call herself ""president of Taiwan"", has so far rejected the 1992 Consensus that maintains both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan are part of one China, thus undermining the cornerstone for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.  In response, Beijing is obliged to take moves to counter separatist forces on the island. National reunification is China's core interest that tolerates no challenge.  So long as Tsai continues to drag her feet on accepting the 1992 Consensus, the prospects for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits will remain dim.               "
Singapore should not be diverted from right course,6/13/2017,"                      Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's visit to China has been another precious step forward in the two countries' joint endeavors to repair their ties that have been bruised by a number of unpleasant episodes concerning the South China Sea.  On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Singaporean counterpart put forward details for the implementation of the inter-governmental memorandum of understanding which the two countries agreed at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May, expressing the two sides' joint intention to build platforms for interconnectivity, financial cooperation and third-party collaboration.  Although an MOU is more akin to a gentlemen's agreement due to the absence of any legal commitment, that in no way diminishes the political significance of the China-Singapore MOU, which underscores the resilience of their ties.  Singapore has long had an important place in contemporary Chinese diplomacy. Yet some of Singapore's recent diplomatic moves seem to have sent misleading signals. That the two governments have again showcased their convergence of will sends a powerful message countering speculation that outsider intervention might have come between them.  Singapore does have legitimate interests that differ from, even at times contradict, China's. But that does not mean it has any reason to help others hurt China's core interests. Only when they approach their differences from a constructive perspective and are sensitive to each other's core concerns will China and Singapore be able to cooperate effectively.  The historical China-Singapore rapport was built on a solid basis of mutual understanding; yet the recent glitches in ties have displayed Singapore's misinterpretations of China's intentions. Things will certainly look uglier than they actually are through the prism of geopolitical rivalry. And will inevitably be so if handled as such.  While many of China's development programs, including the Belt and Road Initiative, can advance with or without Singapore's participation, whether they can work together to promote a peaceful, prosperous neighborhood does matter.  Singapore's constructive potential in regional affairs and relations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it will have the presidency next year, is underlined by the recent agreement between China and ASEAN to enhance their partnership and negotiations on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea.  By working at odds with each other, they would only hinder efforts to promote peace and stability in the region; by working together, they can do wonderful things, as their past relations show.

Guo Wengui will finally be brought to justice,6/12/2017,"                              Pangu Seven Star Hotel, one of Beijing's most extravagant hotels, is housed in the dragon-shaped Pangu Plaza, just next to the Bird's Nest. Photos provided to China Daily    Three former executives of Pangu Investment Co Ltd stood trial in Xigang District People's Court in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, on Friday for fraudulently obtaining loans and foreign exchange using fabricated documents. All of the defendants pleaded guilty to the charges.    These economic crimes, however, are only the tip of the iceberg for the company's actual controlling shareholder Guo Wengui, who fled to the United States in 2014, and is subsequently subject to an Interpol Red Notice.  Guo, who rose from obscurity in the countryside of Liaocheng in East China's Shandong province, is wanted for allegedly accumulating huge amounts of wealth over the past two decades by means of land speculation, insider trading and swindling bank loans.  To pave the way for these activities, he allegedly established an alliance of interests with corrupt senior officials who he bribed with money and women. He has been associated with a number of fallen officials including Ma Jian, former vice-minister of the Ministry of State Security, Zhang Yue, former chief of politics and law of North China's Hebei province, and Xiang Junbo, former chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Guo's business empire was actually enabled by these corrupt officials' trading power for money and rent seeking, as well as their illegal seizure of State and private assets. That also explains why Guo had been seen as being an ""infinitely resourceful"" businessman who could do anything he wanted.  His case has long been regarded as sensitive, and thus eye-catching, because of the large number of senior officials involved.  That most of the officials involved in Guo's case have already been caught and punished has fueled speculation about Guo's fate.  The trial in Dalian, though not a big case given the seriousness of the crimes Guo is suspected of committing, sends a clear message that the judicial authorities have acquired enough evidence in the three years since he fled the country to initiate the trial of Guo.  The court is making public the trial proceedings by updating its official micro blog with words and photos in a real-time manner.  Such courtroom transparency has become the normal practice in cases where there is great public interest. It not only satisfies the public's right to know, but also puts the judicial process under public scrutiny, so as to better ensure judicial justice and fairness.  It was believed that Guo's repatriation would only be a matter of time. Justice may be late, but it will never be absent. All people are equal before the law, no matter how ""resourceful"" they are.               "

These economic crimes, however, are only the tip of the iceberg for the company's actual controlling shareholder Guo Wengui, who fled to the United States in 2014, and is subsequently subject to an Interpol Red Notice.   Guo, who rose from obscurity in the countryside of Liaocheng in East China's Shandong province, is wanted for allegedly accumulating huge amounts of wealth over the past two decades by means of land speculation, insider trading and swindling bank loans.   To pave the way for these activities, he allegedly established an alliance of interests with corrupt senior officials who he bribed with money and women. He has been associated with a number of fallen officials including Ma Jian, former vice-minister of the Ministry of State Security, Zhang Yue, former chief of politics and law of North China's Hebei province, and Xiang Junbo, former chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Guo's business empire was actually enabled by these corrupt officials' trading power for money and rent seeking, as well as their illegal seizure of State and private assets. That also explains why Guo had been seen as being an ""infinitely resourceful"" businessman who could do anything he wanted.  His case has long been regarded as sensitive, and thus eye-catching, because of the large number of senior officials involved.   That most of the officials involved in Guo's case have already been caught and punished has fueled speculation about Guo's fate.   The trial in Dalian, though not a big case given the seriousness of the crimes Guo is suspected of committing, sends a clear message that the judicial authorities have acquired enough evidence in the three years since he fled the country to initiate the trial of Guo.   The court is making public the trial proceedings by updating its official micro blog with words and photos in a real-time manner.   Such courtroom transparency has become the normal practice in cases where there is great public interest. It not only satisfies the public's right to know, but also puts the judicial process under public scrutiny, so as to better ensure judicial justice and fairness.   It was believed that Guo's repatriation would only be a matter of time. Justice may be late, but it will never be absent. All people are equal before the law, no matter how ""resourceful"" they are.         "
Promising signs that peninsula stakeholders might work together,6/8/2017,"                      The Republic of Korea has reportedly suspended the rollout of a controversial US missile defense system on its soil after its President Moon Jae-in ordered an environmental impact assessment.   This is expected to allow more time and room for Seoul to fully weigh the pros and cons of deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense and it is to be hoped it arrives at a more rational decision that accommodates the concerns of all parties involved.  The installment of the THAAD system in the ROK, a decision made during the administration of impeached and ousted president Park Geun-hye, has complicated the already combustible situation on the Korean Peninsula and worsened the ROK's ties with China.  The issue of THAAD has continued to cast a shadow over Sino-ROK relations despite some signs of improvement since Moon entered office last month.  On the campaign trail, Moon supported a THAAD review and vowed to consult China on the issue, which raised hopes THAAD's rollout would be suspended or even reversed.  Last week, Moon consolidated such hopes by ordering an investigation into the clandestine shipment of four more anti-missile launchers for the THAAD battery already installed in the country.   However, the optimism that engendered was dashed when Moon told visiting US Senator Dick Durbin on May 31 that the investigation is not about ""trying to change the existing decision or sending a message to the United States"".  Moon seems to be caught in a difficult situation: By reversing the decision to deploy THAAD, he will displease the United States; by giving the green light to it, he will definitely deal a fatal blow to the ROK's relations with China.  In fact, he can take his lead from the words of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who, speaking during the Shangri-La Forum in Singapore over the weekend, quoted President Xi Jinping, saying ""only if all sides live up to their responsibilities and come together from different directions can the nuclear issue on the peninsula be resolved as quickly as possible.""  Mattis said those words ""must be followed by actions by all of us"".   No doubt, the controversies surrounding THAAD have all stemmed from the nuclear issue on the peninsula. But even though Moon has expressed his willingness to engage with the ROK's neighbor in the north, Seoul cannot defuse the crisis singlehandedly.  The US has stepped up collaboration with China over the issue, which has contributed to easing tensions on the peninsula.  This good momentum should be nurtured because communication and negotiation are the only feasible means for stakeholders to build consensuses and find solutions acceptable to all.         "
US has no cause to be adversarial with China,6/8/2017,"                      As always, the US Department of Defense's 2017 report on military and security developments involving China carries some of the all-too-familiar biased interpretations of China's actions and intentions.  Portraying Chinese moves regarding its South China Sea territories and approach to related disputes as ""coercion"", for instance, it ignores Beijing's endeavors to ease tensions, and its latest consensuses with the Philippines and Vietnam on dispute management and bilateral consultations. The accusation that China supports its modernization via ""cyber theft, targeted foreign direct investment, and exploitation of the access of private Chinese nationals"" to foreign technologies is also included as usual.  But that might well be all that can be said of the concerns China's growing presence elicits. Because although the Department of Defense openly identifies China as one of the US' ""potential adversaries""-along with Russia, Iran and Democratic People's Republic of Korea-in its ""Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Request"", the report appears genuine about the nonaggressive nature of Chinese military progress.  Despite being obvious, though unspoken, worries about the logistics base the Chinese navy is building in Djibouti, and likely new ones elsewhere, it acknowledges: ""A greater overseas naval logistics and basing footprint would better position the PLA to expand its participation in non-combatant evacuation operations, search-and-rescue, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, and sea lines of communication security.""  No country can afford to leave its economic lifelines unprotected. In China's case, these span from the East and South China seas through the Strait of Malacca and Indian Ocean to Africa and Europe. And to every country concerned, China's participation in antipiracy patrols and escort missions in the Gulf of Aden are an essential public service. As the report observes, ""China's expanding international economic interests are increasing demands for the PLAN (PLA Navy) to operate in more distant maritime environments to protect Chinese citizens, investments, and critical sea lines of communication"". And as the inclusive, expansive Belt and Road Initiative proceeds, further overseas security guarantees will be required.  One critical, yet oft-omitted or distorted, aspect of the narrative of Chinese military developments is about purpose. The drafters of the report conclude ""China's leaders remain focused on developing the capabilities to deter or defeat adversary power projection and counter third-party intervention-including by the United States-during a crisis or conflict."" In other words, China's leaders are preoccupied with defense.  Since, as the report concedes, China's ""military modernization program has become more focused on supporting missions beyond China's periphery, including power projection, sea lane security, counter piracy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief"", there is a question to be answered: Why is China considered a potential adversary?

SCO expected to consolidate regional solidarity at summit,6/7/2017,"                              Premier Li Keqiang advocates the establishment of a free-trade zone at the 15th Meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council of Heads of Governments in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on Nov 3, 2016. LIU ZHEN / CHINA NEWS SERVICE    In recent years, the annual summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has grabbed increasing global attention due to its growing influence in regional affairs.    The upcoming meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of State in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, will be no exception as it is expected to give the green light to Pakistan and India becoming members of the organization alongside the founders China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and see the adoption of a convention on anti-extremism.  These crucial steps will further consolidate the organizational and institutional framework of the organization, enabling it to more effectively respond to the challenges confronting the region and the world at large.  Sixteen years ago in Shanghai, the six countries rallied for the first time to address the ""three evil forces"" of terrorism, separatism, and extremism and usher in a better security environment. Since then, the SCO has adopted a series of mechanisms to curtail the penetration of the three evil forces into its member states and helped prevent the unrest in West Asia spreading into Central Asia.  Security collaboration and economic cooperation are the ""two wheels"" of the bloc, with enhanced security coordination to combat terrorism and maintain stability helping to drive the members' economic cooperation.  The rampancy of extremism and frequent terrorist attacks across the world call for greater international consensus and more international collaboration to combat both the symptoms and root causes of the disease.  As a bloc that is increasingly looked upon as a defender of regional peace and stability, the SCO's planned expansion and convention on anti-extremism show it is willing to shoulder this responsibility and step up its efforts to fight all forms of the three evil forces.  With the accession of India and Pakistan, the SCO will cover three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half the world's population, which will not only make it more representative but also give it a stronger voice in forging international cooperation to defeat terrorism.  As President Xi Jinping has pointed it out, the SCO members have created a new model of international security relations, partnership instead of alliance, because they have embraced the principles of mutual trust, reciprocity, equality, consultation, respect for diversity and common development.  After the Astana summit, China will take over the SCO rotating presidency and Beijing is drawing up a work plan covering six major fields, politics, economy, security, humanities, foreign relations and mechanism building, so as to promote even greater solidarity among its members.

For the future of the country education needs further reform,6/6/2017,"                              A Beijing Chenjinglun High School student does exercises while she has breakfast in preparation for the national college entrance exam known as the gaokao, May 15, 2017. The gaokao starts on June 7. [Photo/VCG]      With a mixed feeling of hope, excitement and anxiety, millions of students across the country will sit the national college entrance exams, or gaokao, on Wednesday. What makes this year's exams even more memorable is that it is the 40th anniversary since they were resumed after the end of the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76).        There is hardly any policy in China's modern history that has had such an effect on people's futures as the resumption of the exams. For 11 years before 1977, the institutions of higher learning, all caught up in the political chaos, enrolled students based on recommendations by working units or rural communes.  About 5.7 million candidates, most of them forced out of schools and sent to work in the countryside and factories, took part in the exams in 1977. Although only 270,000 were enrolled that year, the message was sent and received. For the first time in so many years, people started to realize that they could write their own destiny again with mastery of knowledge. The zeal to learn and make up for the lost time among tens of millions of young people started to change the country's landscape of education and ushered in a new spring for science.  In the decades that have followed, the national college entrance exams have been acknowledged by the public as an open and fair platform to select talents, despite their acknowledged shortcomings. The role they have played is irreplaceable. It is probably no exaggeration to say that China would not have achieved its remarkable economic growth without the resumption of the exams, which laid the foundation for China's fast development in science and technology.  Compared with their counterparts 40 years ago, the examinees today face less intense competition thanks to a massive expansion in college enrollment since the late 1990s. Actually, in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, nearly all students can go to college if they apply themselves to their studies.  But that should not breed complacency. Education fairness remains a major problem, as reflected in the unbalanced state education funding in developed and less developed regions, which has prevented education from fulfilling its role as an enabler of social mobility.  And further reform of the education system is needed to change the emphasis from students' scores to the cultivation of the creative, independent and critical thinking that will help the country to redefine its future. That includes the exams, which will make it possible for students to place enough emphasis on their well-rounded development.         "
Dialogue and accommodation will ensure peace and stability,6/5/2017,"                      In recent years, the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore has become a venue for some Western countries to point accusing fingers at China over sensitive regional issues, such as the South China Sea.  This year, thanks to the United States and a few of its regional allies, such groundless accusations continued to be heard at the three-day event, which concluded on Saturday. The repeated indictments against China run counter to the forum's original intention of seeking common ground for regional security issues and promoting security cooperation.  Defense ministers from the US, Japan, France and Australia talked at length about the rules-based world order at the dialogue, with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis taking the lead in accusing China of disregarding the rules in the South China Sea.  Mattis talked as if the US was a role model for observing international rules. But concerns that the US seeks to always get its own way are not unfounded, for while the US often presents itself as a role model for maintaining the world order and observing international rules, it is not shy about setting precedents for putting its own interests above international norms.  US President Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change pact offers the latest example of how the US disregards international agreements to suit its selfish and shortsighted needs.  And rather than being a disruptive force as claimed, there is a growing consensus that China is playing an increasingly important role in upholding peace and stability, as can be seen from the positive outcomes from Premier Li Keqiang's trip to Europe.  China's response to the accusations was expressed by Lieutenant General He Lei, vice-president of the People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Science, who, speaking on the sidelines of the forum, said China is both a defender and observer of international and regional rules.  For example, in the South China Sea disputes, where Mattis and others accused China of throwing its weight around, Beijing has always championed dialogues and consultations as the only feasible way to resolve the differences with the parties concerned.  And about two weeks ago, China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations successfully drafted a framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, paving the way for fully implementing the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.  The challenges of the times, not least the global threat of terrorism, mean that a zero-sum mentality is outdated and countries should instead work together to expand their cooperation.

Trump gives the world more reasons to save our planet,6/2/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump (R) walks with the President of the European Council Donald Tusk in Brussels, Belgium, May 25, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Once in a while there comes a time when just a single action changes for better or for worse the course of the world. The 21st century, during its short span, has experienced quite a few such moves, with one being made by the leader of the richest and strongest country of the world on Thursday.  The consequences of the move can only be guessed as of now. Yet it doesn't take rocket science to fathom that US President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement makes the future of concerted global action against climate change uncertain.  The signs of the times to come were visible at the end of March, when Trump signed the ""Energy Independence Executive Order"" to ""annul"" the Barack Obama administration's legislation on reducing coal, oil and gas production and curbing carbon emissions.   By ordering a review of Obama's Clean Power Plan and slashing the funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump made it almost impossible for the US to honor its international climate commitments, the Paris climate agreement included. Ever since there were murmurs that Trump would pull the US out of the Paris pact.  Announcing his decision, Trump, who has dismissed climate change as a hoax, said: ""The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord"" and would seek to begin new negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction ""on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers ...""  That the US under Obama's leadership and China led by President Xi Jinping played a decisive role in negotiating the Paris agreement is common knowledge. The two countries' announcement of drastically curbing their respective emissions ensured widespread participation in the Paris pact. Which means Trump's move to withdraw the US from the pact could also have severe diplomatic consequences, as other countries, its close allies included, might no longer expect Washington to honor its commitments.  Making China's stance clear even before Trump's announcement, Premier Li Keqiang emphasized on Thursday that Beijing will stick to the commitment to fulfill its Paris pledges during his visit to Berlin.   ""I was elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" Trump asserted in his announcement. To which Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto replied: ""Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow the Paris agreement.""  While in Paris, French President Emmanuel Marcon stated bluntly: ""I tell you firmly tonight: We will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way. Don't be mistaken on climate; there is no plan B because there is no planet B.""  Since Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris pact and thus global climate leadership, joining ""a small handful of nations that reject the future"" as Obama said, the rest of the world, including China, which is committed to realizing Xi's vision of jointly building and protecting our shared home, have come together to express their united resolve to do even more to protect the one planet we've got.            "
China-EU cooperation can counter global uncertainty,6/1/2017,"                      With the world facing multiple uncertainties and new challenges, closer and stronger ties between China and European countries cater not only to their mutual interests but also benefit the world at large.  Premier Li Keqiang's ongoing visit to Germany and Belgium, though planned earlier, came just days after US President Donald Trump's first upsetting-of-the-apple-cart visit to Europe, which prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say that Europe can no longer fully rely on others.  In contrast, during their meeting in Berlin on Wednesday, Li and Merkel time and again emphasized the importance of bilateral ties and vowed to accelerate the synergy of their countries' respective economic strategies.  Such determination to continue to nourish the tree of friendship and enrich and expand pragmatic, reciprocal cooperation will not only contribute to their respective development needs but also help to shore up global confidence that it is not just every country for itself, as Trump keeps implying.  Thanks to their mutual efforts in deepening political trust and expanding all-round cooperation, Sino-German ties have become the most profound and the most reliable nation-to-nation ties among China's relations with European countries.   And as the world's two most predictable and most stable forces, China and Germany are acting as confidence boosters and rallying others to the causes of global economic development and stability.  Sharing broad common interests and similar stances on important regional and international issues, the two are increasingly looked to for leadership in shoring up the open economy, free trade and investment.  And in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world, it is a natural choice for China and the EU to work together to deepen mutual trust, fend off protectionism and unlock the development potential of their relations.  Li is scheduled to meet EU leaders in Brussels on Friday, and the two sides are expected to discuss ways to maintain the good momentum that has been achieved in bilateral cooperation in traditional economic and trade fields while also vigorously promoting greater cooperation in new areas such as infrastructure, finance and the digital economy.  And as the United States is poised to withdraw from the Paris Accord on climate change, which will send the message that it's putting its own interests first and the devil take the hindmost, Li and the EU leaders are expected to issue a joint declaration on combating climate change on Friday, consolidating the consensus of the rest of the international community that common interests take precedence and outweigh any differences.                 "
Kenyan railway new milestone for China-Africa cooperation,6/1/2017,"                              Two female engine drivers gesture before the operations of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) in Mombasa, Kenya, on May 31, 2017. Kenya began operations on the Chinese-built Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) Wednesday. [Photo/Xinhua]      The official launch of the China-funded and built standard gauge railway in Kenya on Wednesday, which links its port city of Mombasa with the capital Nairobi, marks the beginning of a new era for the East African country's industrialization and economic development.  Moreover, it is a pivotal part of China's Belt and Road Initiative that encompasses a grand infrastructure connectivity plan to build a high-speed railway network that will eventually link Kenya with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.  With a designed speed of 120 kilometers per hour for passenger trains and 80 km/h for freight trains, the 480-km railway replaces the narrow-gauge line built more than a century ago during British colonial rule.  Thanks to the $3.8 billion new railway, Kenya's largest infrastructure project since independence, cargo transport costs will be reduced by nearly half compared with the cost of road transport, according to Kenya Railways Corp. This will help bring in foreign investments along the route and facilitate the country's quest to become an industrial, trading and tourism hub in East Africa.  It is predicted the railway will boost Kenya's GDP by 1.5 percentage points annually. Not to mention how much Kenya has already benefited in terms of jobs created and technology gained.  The bonds of friendship between China and Africa in contemporary history have been forged over decades, symbolized by the 1,800-km Tanzania-Zambia Railway built and financed by China in the 1970s in the heat of liberation struggles by African people against Western colonists.  If the two peoples were drawn together by common historical sufferings and similar stage of development then, the current momentum of cooperation is being fueled more by their growing interdependence.  African countries look to China for support to achieve their aspirations in terms of poverty alleviation, economic growth and sustainable development, while China, after decades of miraculous growth, has development experience to share with Africa. Bilateral production capacity cooperation in such fields as manufacturing, electronic appliances and textiles can also benefit African countries.  As President Xi Jinping has stated, China is committed to connecting its development with that of Africa, aligning the interests of the Chinese people with those of African people and combining China's development opportunities with those of Africa.  It is this sense of shared destiny and future that has laid the foundation for the win-win cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit between China and Africa, as reflected in the Kenyan railway project.

"Dialogue suggests China, Japan can find a way out of impasse",5/31/2017,"                      That Beijing and Tokyo both underlined the need to take each other as a potential partner rather than a threat was an important outcome of their just concluded fourth high-level political dialogue.  Amid their seemingly endless impasse, that both sides have taken note of the damaging potential of mutual distrust and aspire to improve bilateral relations represents a step toward breaking the deadlock.  Many are accustomed to attributing the troubled bilateral ties to Japan's inability to adapt to the new reality of a rising China. But Beijing, too, is in the process trying to figure out what is the best approach to its growing impacts on regional and global affairs and the outside perceptions of them. In that sense, how Beijing and Tokyo see and approach each other will to a great extent determine the geopolitical landscape of Northeast Asia, if not the entire Asia-Pacific.  As everybody knows, there is a long shadow of history that prevents the countries from getting really close, especially under the current leadership in Japan which is unwilling to let the past rest in peace. But that does not mean there is no way out.  The generally warm relationship between Beijing and Tokyo since the normalization of diplomatic ties, which existed until a few years ago, is telling proof that there are ways to prevent the specter of the past from haunting ties. Even if the past cannot be completely laid to rest, properly managing divergences may at least release some positive energy to restore some warmth into bilateral ties.  But despite Beijing and Tokyo claiming a shared commitment to regional peace and stability, as well as good global governance, there has been no indication they are willing or able to collaborate.  More often than not, Beijing has found Tokyo working against it, whether that is Tokyo's ongoing endeavors to resurrect the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement or its putting what are regional maritime issues on broader international agendas.  Relations between the two countries are at an important juncture, and experience shows ties can escape the dark shadows of the past with the joint efforts of people with vision in the two countries, and in so doing bring tangible benefits to the two nations and both peoples.  To build on the positive signals that have emerged from Monday's dialogue, the two sides should remind themselves of their original intention for normalizing ties, and pursue the continuous enhancement of bilateral relations based on the four political documents and the four-point agreement reached between them. In this way, the outstanding challenges can be overcome and new opportunities seized.                 "
US navigation game not good for better relations,5/26/2017,"                              File photo of South China Sea. [Photo/Xinhua]      So, again, a US Navy warship conducted a ""freedom of navigation operation"" close to a Chinese reef in the South China Sea. Such navigation in itself is worth no fuss, even if it is a first since Donald Trump assumed the US presidency.  A real ""freedom of navigation operation"" may be harmless. But it will be hardly distinguishable from an innocent passage in the South China Sea. All because freedom of navigation has never been an issue in those waters.  Using such operation as an excuse appears particularly ridiculous as the once tense situation there has conspicuously defused because countries in the region have agreed to resolve their maritime disputes with China through dialogue.  Yet the United States needs to justify its military's presence there, both to continue dominating the crucial strategic waterways and to assure regional allies and partners of its support. No matter how useless it is, the US will have to sustain the ritual. And such voyages no longer raise eyebrows exactly because they are increasingly like a ceremonial, symbolic formality. In the words of Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis, the US Navy operates in the region ""on a daily basis"", ""in accordance with international law"". If that is the case, there is even less to worry about.  But the problem is that the Pentagon even claimed the USS Dewey voyage was aimed at countering China's alleged efforts to limit the freedom of navigation.  Washington claims Beijing may use its defense facilities on its islands in the South China Sea to ""limit movement"". It is another matter that there is not even a hint of Beijing doing that.  Few details about the US vessel's voyage on Wednesday are available, except Western media reports citing anonymous US officials as saying it sailed within 12 nautical miles of China's Meiji Reef. Neither the People's Liberation Army Navy, nor the US Navy has confirmed that. The only thing we know for sure is nothing particular happened. Or there would not have been the current quiet.  Since there is a complete set of protocols in place for the two navies to handle encounters at sea, chances of unwanted conflicts may be slim. But that does not mean such seemingly routine operations will not cast a shadow over broader China-US relations.  Unless there is proof this specific voyage was truly separate from political deliberations, it certainly will have its consequences as an inopportune episode when Beijing and Washington vow to collaborate more closely. Which is not bad, though. It may be a useful reminder to those who are overly optimistic about the prospects of bilateral ties.         "
Shared commitment critical to counter threat of terrorism,5/25/2017,"                              Two women wrapped in thermal blankets stand near the Manchester Arena, where US singer Ariana Grande had been performing, in Manchester, northern England, Britain, May 23, 2017. [Photo/VCG]      Monday's suicide bombing in the British city of Manchester, which killed 22 people, including children, was the most serious terrorist attack in the country since 2005.  The Islamic State, a terrorist group still wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility, while the British police named the attacker as 22-year-old Salman Abedi, born in Manchester to Libyan parents, who died after setting off an improvised explosive device.  That a number of European cities have suffered terrorist attacks in recent years should be a reminder that security can never be emphasized enough. The fact that the deadly bombing in Manchester targeted a concert by the popular US singer Ariana Grande also shows the importance of buttressing up security in large sites and venues.  By attacking such places the instigators intended to trigger panic and anxiety to the greatest extent. More vigilance and greater efforts to enhance public security in places of mass gathering are necessary, not just in Europe but also elsewhere, as no country today is immune from the threat of terrorism.  The international community needs to come up with more effective ways to tackle the immediate threats of terrorists, while also eliminating the soil that breeds terrorist and extremist ideologies.  In recent years, especially after the rise of the IS group in the Middle East, there has been international cooperation in the war against terror both in the region and beyond. But compared with the aim of uprooting terrorism, what has been achieved is not enough.  Some countries fighting the IS group in the Middle East cannot agree with one another on either the targets or the objectives of the war against terror, and the lack of coordination and common goals has given the terrorist group breathing space.  Internationally, countries are also dragging their feet in sharing intelligence and cutting off the financing channels of terrorist groups. Not to mention that little has been done to address the root causes of international terrorism and extremism, such as poverty, social conflicts and inequality.  The spread of terrorist and extremist ideology worldwide and the recurrence of terrorist attacks in some European countries should sound a clarion call that international cooperation urgently needs to be strengthened to tackle both the symptoms and the causes of the disease.  As the war against terrorism and extremism remains an uphill struggle, countries around the world should neither lose confidence nor relent in the efforts to jointly combat the scourge, so as to usher in a world free from the threat of terrorism at the earliest date.

"Joint work by Seoul, Beijing key to peace on peninsula",5/24/2017,"                              Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with Lee Hae-chan, special envoy of the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Moon Jae-in, in Beijing, capital of China, May 18, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Things became so ugly between Beijing and Seoul during the last days of the Park Geun-hye presidency that every sign of warmth evaporated. All because of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system the United States and Republic of Korea militaries rushed into the country amid the political vacuum prior to the general election following Park's impeachment.  Now that the new administration in Seoul has displayed a change of approach to bilateral ties, as well as an awareness of the damaging potential of THAAD, a thaw may be around the corner.  On the heels of a fence-mending trip to Beijing by a ROK presidential envoy, it has been reported that Chinese travel agencies may soon restart ROK-bound group tours.  On Monday in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, responding to a media query, visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Seoul to take advantage of the positive interaction following the envoy's visit, and ""remove the thorn stuck in the throat of bilateral relations"".  There is no bigger thorn than THAAD choking the relationship. Its removal, however, will take a lot more than the porous pretext the previous administration employed for its deployment-that THAAD is indispensable for the ROK's national security.  To what extent the system would be able to defend Seoul from Pyongyang's missiles aside, two things are obvious: THAAD cannot protect Seoul from Pyongyang's overwhelming artillery firepower and it compromises Chinese security.  Deploying THAAD is a no-win decision. Its only proven effect thus far has been estranging Beijing from Seoul, which would otherwise have been able to collaborate well in dealing with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea based on a shared belief that sanctions and dialogue should be pursued simultaneously. Their lack of united efforts has allowed the latter to conduct two more successful missile tests in disregard of international protests and sanctions.  A peaceful resolution to the DPRK's nuclear program would do away with the most-feared threat to the ROK's security and make THAAD redundant. The only sensible way to achieve that is for Beijing and Seoul to coordinate, cooperate and show solidarity.  In so doing, they can end Pyongyang's hopes of exploiting and profiting from their estrangement, and convince Washington that their approach works.  Pyongyang has repeatedly taken advantage of the schisms to continue its nuclear/missile adventure. The impressive progress it has demonstrated through the latest tests is a grim reminder that Beijing and Seoul need unity and shared resolve to solve the Korean Peninsula issue through peaceful means.

Rental regulation can help tame unreasonable housing market,5/23/2017,"                              A man visits a house agent. [Photo/IC]      Since March about 60 major cities have reportedly unveiled 170 measures that set stricter mortgage restrictions and higher down payment requirements to root out market speculation. In the most recent case, Baoding, a city 200 kilometers southwest to Beijing, announced over the weekend that owners of property to be developed on a newly released piece of land will not be allowed to sell it within 10 years.  Such measures to curb soaring house prices have been called the toughest in China's history, and the latest official data seem to prove that such tightening measures have had some effect in cooling the once red-hot market.  Of the 70 major cities surveyed, 30 recorded a lower price increase year-on-year in April, up from 24 in March, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  Yet the fact that investment in property development remained robust in April despite the intensified government controls shows there is no room for complacency.  Based on the property price-to-wage ratio compiled by the International Monetary Fund, housing prices in China's largest cities are already the highest in the world. And given that nearly 45 percent of new bank loans flowed into the housing market in 2016, according to China's central bank, housing market bubbles, fueled by speculative investments, are thought to pose not only one of the biggest risks to China's economic growth but also its financial security, which President Xi Jinping recently identified as a key element of national security.  Thus it is no coincidence that the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development issued a draft regulation on Sunday to standardize the residential rental market and make it an attractive alternative to buying houses, since the lack of a mature rental property market has been one of the reasons why the repeatedly introduced measures to curb speculation have only achieved short-term success.  The measures contained in the draft regulation, such as forbidding landlords from arbitrarily evicting tenants or raising the rent without notifying tenants three months in advance, all offer better protection of tenants' rights in a bid to encourage more people to rent a house instead buying one.  For only when people feel as secure in a rented house as in their own property will the mad scramble to purchase property be tamed.  The draft regulation is thus a welcome step toward achieving the top leadership's stated goal that houses should be ""for people to live in, not for speculation"".         "
Messages mean more than just a ceremonial exchange of goodwill,5/22/2017,"                              Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan,on April 15, 2015. [Photo/IC]      In a congratulatory message to the chairman-elect of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping expressed the hope that both parties will continue to adhere to the 1992 Consensus and resolutely fight against ""Taiwan independence"" .  In his return message, Wu Den-yih said the two parties should keep deepening the consensus on one China and seek to institutionalize cross-Straits peace.  Ceremonial as it looks, this exchange of pledges of commitment to the 1992 Consensus is essential after the recent confusion created by local media about Wu's faith in one China.  As a KMT veteran and seasoned politician, Wu certainly knows the critical importance of the 1992 Consensus in which Taiwan and the mainland agreed there is one China.  The tense standoff that has developed between Taiwan and the mainland since Tsai Ing-wen's administration took office on the island shows what can happen when that consensus is not upheld. Tsai, despite Beijing's repeated calls, has refused to commit to the consensus, which is widely accepted as both a guarantee and precondition for constructive interaction between the two sides.  Beijing has made it crystal clear that all the troubles facing Tsai and bilateral ties originate from her stubborn refusal to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus. Present and past cross-Straits ties prove the only way out of those troubles is to accept the reality there is only one China.  The biggest mistake Tsai has made is demolishing the groundwork the KMT painstakingly laid for cross-Straits relations under the island's former leader Ma Ying-jeou. With the rapport of the Ma-era gone, Tsai has seen one door after another slammed shut on her administration.  Tsai's failure is rooted in her delusion that she was entitled to inherit everything that was present when she took over, ignoring the fact that many of the island's new-found benefits and privileges were contingent on good relations with the mainland. In other words, those are dividends of cross-Straits rapport.  Since Tsai has chosen to turn her back on Beijing, there is no rapport and thus no accompanying dividends.  It remains a big question whether the KMT can successfully accomplish the transformation its leadership has envisioned and regain voter confidence. But the party's commitment to one China is at least a precious check on separatist sentiment on the island.  For that reason, we salute incumbent KMT chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu's dedication to her party's unity as well as one China, and wish Wu, the new party chief, good luck in rebuilding and reinvigorating the KMT.

Draft pact shows progress possible without interference,5/19/2017,"                              Photo taken aboard the US drilling ship JOIDES Resolution shows the sunset scenery of the South China Sea on March 31, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Senior officials from China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations announced on Thursday in Guiyang, Southwest China's Guizhou province, that the two sides have completed the first draft of a framework for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.  This landmark document reflects their shared determination to build the South China Sea into a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship.  Since last year, tensions over the South China Sea disputes have abated remarkably thanks to the restraint and diplomatic efforts of the parties concerned. This has helped usher in a cordial atmosphere for talks on a Code of Conduct, thus paving the way for full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea agreed in 2002.  It is heartening to see the South China Sea issue has been brought back onto the right track of dialogue and consultation after last year's turbulence. One important consensus has been that interference by outside forces will not bring peace and stability, but instead only creates uncertainties and undermines the interests of both China and the ASEAN member states.  The latest breakthrough was made during the 14th Senior Officials' Meeting on the Implementation of the DOC between China and ASEAN.  The 23rd Senior Officials Consultations will convene in Guiyang on Friday, and the first bilateral consultation between China and the Philippines on the South China Sea is also scheduled for Friday in Guiyang.  These interactions and exchanges between China and members of the regional bloc, conducted just a few days after Beijing hosted the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, prove that ASEAN is a top priority in China's good-neighborly diplomacy.  China has always supported ASEAN taking center stage in regional integration and playing a bigger role in international affairs. It has vowed to throw its weight behind ASEAN's commitment to build an economic community and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.  In fact, ASEAN's development strategy can dovetail with China's Belt and Road Initiative in many ways. ASEAN countries are situated where the land and maritime Silk Roads converge, and China sees ASEAN as an important partner in promoting the initiative, which will create huge development opportunities for ASEAN countries to seize.  The China-ASEAN relationship has maintained a healthy trend in recent years and is surging ahead along a fast track of development. The convergence of ASEAN's development plan and China's Belt and Road Initiative, which is based on the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, will inject even more vitality into their reciprocal cooperation.

Latest judicial guideline is not a letup on drunken driving,5/18/2017,"                             [Cai Meng/China Daily]      The Supreme People's Court issued a pilot guideline on the penalties for drunken driving recently, which stipulates that offenses that cause very little harm to society should not be considered crimes, and thus be exempt from the penalties set out for dangerous driving in the Criminal Law.  It is reasonable to argue that all cases of drunken driving should not be treated the same, as the circumstances differ. That is why the new guideline grants judges the discretion to decide whether someone caught driving under the influence of alcohol should be held criminally responsible, taking into account how drunk the driver was, how recklessly he or she was driving and the extent of any damage they may have done.  However, the high court's decision has sparked concern among many, as they interpret it as a softening of the harsh stance taken by the authorities since 2011, when drunken driving was made a crime under the amended Criminal Law and Road Traffic Safety Law.  The rising number of people with a driver's license, combined with a culture that still sees drinking as the lubricant for human relations, fuels fears that a relaxing of that tougher line will reverse the progress that has been made in reducing the number of accidents caused by drivers under the influence of alcohol.  The reduced tolerance for such behavior was widely welcomed by many among the public, who saw it as the only effective way to check some drivers' reckless behavior and make roads safer.  And thanks to the stepped-up clampdown, cases involving drunken driving reportedly dropped 34 percent from 2011 to 2016, and more and more drivers have embraced the maxim ""don't drink and drive"".  The guideline does not mean a more relaxed attitude toward drunken driving-those caught driving under the influence will still receive penalties-but rather a more targeted approach aimed at curbing dangerous driving as a result of alcohol consumption.  For despite the progress that has been made, China is still the country with the highest number of road traffic deaths in the world. It is not just drunken driving that is responsible for this unwelcome distinction, but also drivers' disregard for the traffic rules.  With a short history of private car ownership, many Chinese are yet to cultivate safe driving habits, a task that is impossible to accomplish without strict implementation of the traffic rules. This calls for an all out effort to enhance enforcement of all the road safety rules.         "
Greater global cooperation required to fight cyber crime,5/17/2017,"                              The ransomware virus, dubbed WannaCry, can encrypt all the files on a Windows PC and demands $300 worth of bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency widely used online, to unlock a user's data. [Photo/VCG]      The unprecedented global cyberattack that began on Friday has reportedly infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries and regions, including China, where around 30,000 institutions such as universities and gas stations have fallen victim to the WannaCry ransomware, according to Qihoo 360, a leading Chinese internet security company.  The scale of the attack shows that in an increasingly interconnected world, no country should consider itself safe from cyber threats.  So far no clues have been uncovered as to who was behind the malicious software, which locks users' computer files and demands a ransom payment of $300 to $600 to unlock them. However, the US National Security Agency must shoulder some of the blame, because the computer virus is based on one of the hacking tools that the agency created for its own use, which ended up in the hands of cyber criminals.  That an agency tasked with protecting citizens from cyberattacks was itself so vulnerable to hackers shows how serious the problem is.  However, concerted efforts to tackle cyber crimes have been hindered by the actions of the United States.  For many years cyber security has been one of the major frictions in bilateral relations between China and the US, with Washington often pointing an accusing finger at Beijing, claiming it is engaged in state-sponsored cyber espionage, although it has offered no credible evidence to support its accusation. As a result, Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies have been effectively barred from the US market.  This is hypocritical of the US, to say the least, because no other country has mounted such wide-ranging, costly and long-term surveillance operations in the history of the internet as the NSA's PRISM and other spy programs. Among other things, the latest cyberattack should instill greater urgency in China's efforts to produce its own core technologies, as President Xi Jinping has urged.  It should also prompt the world's two top economies to engage in more meaningful dialogue on cyber security. In fact it is imperative that countries and security agencies around the world work together to better fight cyber crime and other cyber threats as China emphasized in a cyberspace plan of action released in March.  Today, our social and economic activities increasingly rely on the internet, which calls for enhanced coordination and communication around the world to eliminate vulnerabilities and make it more secure.  After all, cyberspace has no borders. Cooperation, rather than confrontation, is the only way out to make the virtual world a safer place for all.         "
Turning the Belt and Road blueprint into reality,5/16/2017,"                                    President Xi Jinping announces the start of the roundtable of the Belt and Road Forum on Monday in Beijing.[Photo by Ma Zhancheng/Xinhua]      It certainly is too early to tell how well the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative will work off the drawing board. For any undertaking of such magnitude, there are always more variables than certainties.  Yet the joint communiqué and list of deliverables the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation produced will surely inspire greater optimism about its prospects.  In the communiqué, the leaders of China and 29 other participating countries expressed a shared commitment to cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, expounding its objectives, principles and measures of cooperation. The 76-item checklist encompasses both memorandums of intent to collaborate and agreements on specific connectivity projects.  If the former testifies to a shared political will to pursue common prosperity amid the severe global economic headwinds, the latter showcases how much China as a country has committed to realizing the blueprint, financially in particular.  President Xi Jinping talked about synergy while addressing the Leaders Roundtable on Monday, once again driving home the message that, although China proposed the initiative, it is not China's solo show.  Many of the current misgivings about China's role in the Belt and Road narrative have to do with the perception that the initiative, featuring China as the advocator and architect, and also its main investor thus far, will end up being China's vehicle for projecting its own influence.  Yet, as Xi reiterated, the initiative was conceived as an open platform by all, of all, for all. Although it has made tremendous financial commitments to a number of infrastructure projects under the initiative, Beijing is more preoccupied with kick-starting the process by doing so. Even with the financial resources at its disposal, the Chinese government cannot afford to buy influence on such a scale, even if it wished to.  Since the initiative is not an aid program, of course China will keep an eye on the economic returns. Only economically viable projects can be sustainable, and they should bring lasting benefits to local residents in the host countries.  Also because of the initiative's nature as a joint development program, the partnerships fostered thereby will have to engage deeper, broader participation from the host countries, so as to make the partnerships more equitable.  The just concluded forum was no doubt a success for what has been accomplished. But it will take strenuous, persistent follow-up efforts to translate the long list of agreements and pledges of intent into real world outcomes.  That will involve communicating and coordinating.         "
ROK's THAAD review welcome,5/15/2017,"                              File photo shows Seoungju residents chant slogans during a protest against the government's decision on deploying a US THAAD anti-missile defense unit in Seongju, in Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2016. The banner reads ""Desperately oppose deploying THAAD"". [Photo/Agencies]      The decision by the ruling Minjoo Party in the Republic of Korea to push for a parliamentary hearing on the controversial deployment of a US missile defense system in the ROK is an important step toward de-escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  It is also a welcome signal sent by the new ROK President Moon Jae-in that he wants to improve ties with China.  As the United States and the ROK accelerated the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the ROK last month, the tense atmosphere on the peninsula worsened and the confrontation between the various parties became more acute.  The deployment of THAAD in the ROK has also soured relations between Beijing and Seoul, because Beijing sees it as an unacceptable move undermining its own security interests. Thus, the decision made by ROK's new ruling party could be a welcome game changer for both the situation on the peninsula and China-ROK ties.  Considering that disputes over the deployment of THAAD in the ROK have resulted in relations between Beijing and Seoul falling to their lowest ebb in years, the political transition in the ROK offers a good opportunity for Seoul to improve ties with Beijing.  A growing number of people in the ROK have also protested against the installation of the US anti-missile system, believing it could imperil the security of their country instead of shoring it up.  It would cater to the concerns of people in the ROK and those in neighboring countries if the ROK parliament were to vote against the deployment of THAAD in the ROK, or at least delay it.  Meanwhile, all parties concerned should demonstrate restraint and show political wisdom and strategic patience so that joint diplomatic efforts could be made to improve the current situation on the peninsula and work toward building lasting peace and stability in the region.

Initiative provides a platform that all may benefit from,5/15/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in the National Convention Center in Beijing on May 14, 2017. [Wu Zhiyi/China Daily]      It seems suspicion is unavoidable for China: One moment it was accused of being a ""free-rider"" for allegedly doing too little; another moment it is being suspected, by the same people, of harboring ulterior motives for trying to fulfill what is expected of it as a ""responsible power"".  President Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the opening of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the most comprehensive elaboration of China's Belt and Road Initiative so far, answered many questions, including those about its intentions.  As was evident through Xi's remarks, the initiative is fundamentally different from the 1940s' Marshall Plan or the European Recovery Program, or today's Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement-indeed any recent regional development projects. It is distinctive in that, unlike most similar designs for cooperation, it has never been intended to be ""members only"".  Although the original idea was conceived with countries along an overland Silk Road Economic Belt and ocean-linked 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in mind, the Belt and Road Initiative, as they are now collectively known, is an open platform of cooperation that every country is welcome to join and benefit from, as Xi stated on Sunday.  If the thinking behind similar initiatives has been prone to being preoccupied with the concept of dominance, Xi stated in explicit terms that China is committed to building partnerships.  Expounding the Chinese vision of modern day Silk Roads of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation and harmony among civilizations, Xi again underlined the Chinese aspiration for a ""new-type"" of international relations, based on and driven by a spirit of sharing, or in his own words a ""community of shared interests"".  To those concerned about a hidden Chinese agenda to fill the ""power vacuum"" the US administration of Donald Trump is allegedly leaving behind, Xi assured his audience the initiative is not meant to ""reinvent the wheel"", and instead focuses on dovetailing with the development strategies of different countries.  For some of different political persuasions, the blueprint Beijing has displayed may look too good to be true. But even from a very short-term, pragmatic perspective, it is worth embracing, for collective efforts are necessary to sustain growth and ensure no one is left behind, and as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has observed, the initiative can facilitate ""more balanced, inclusive and harmonious development"".  Its emphasis on infrastructure connectivity alone may go a long way toward balancing the global economic landscape.  That the forum has convened decision-makers from dozens of countries is a telling vote of confidence in the initiative as a way to pursue ""interconnected development and deliver benefits to all"".         "
Forum a venue for partners to explore further cooperation,5/12/2017,"                                The two-day Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled to start in Beijing on Sunday, will be an ideal occasion for the participants from around the world to not only contribute their views on how to accelerate win-win cooperation, but also to acquire a better understanding of China's intentions in promoting the Belt and Road Initiative.        Concerns, and even suspicion, have arisen over the intentions behind the initiative since it was proposed in 2013, most of which stem from a misperception and misunderstanding of China's strategic motivation.  But it is only natural that with the recovery of the global economy still sluggish, international trade flagging, and globalization facing a backlash, China is willing to share its development wisdom and provide public goods to the world now that it is in a position to do so. China's stepping forward with a vision and means for opening the doors to opportunities for common development should be welcomed, for it comes at a time when combined efforts are needed to achieve interconnected and inclusive growth and shared prosperity.  Since 2013, China has invested more than $50 billion in countries involved in the initiative, and a total of 56 economic and trade cooperation zones have been established, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue for the host economies and creating 180,000 local jobs. These early harvests should consolidate global confidence in the initiative's ability to inject vitality into economies and promote shared development and prosperity.  Indeed more and more countries have come to appreciate the Belt and Road Initiative as they recognize that its hallmarks are openness, inclusiveness and mutual benefit.  That representatives from more than 100 countries will attend the forum in Beijing is evidence that the initiative is not an exclusive membership club but rather an open platform dedicated to extensive consultations, joint contributions and shared benefits.  Both developed and developing economies will take part in the forum and play the roles they want to play. Under the initiative, each participating country, big or small, is an equal partner whatever its economic strength.  Although the initiative has been proposed by China, China does not seek to dominate it. Nor is it using it to vie for global leadership. Instead the initiative is an embodiment of China's view that the world is a close-knit community of shared destiny.  By hosting the forum, it is providing a venue for partners to gather so they can explore new ways to achieve inclusive growth and shared prosperity, which will reinvigorate the global economy and give a shot in the arm to globalization.

New ROK leader may help untie peninsula's Gordian knot,5/11/2017,"                              South Korea's president-elect Moon Jae-in gestures to supporters at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, South Korea, May 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Almost all of a sudden, the apparently imminent danger of a military showdown on the Korean Peninsula seems to have evaporated into thin air.        A government delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea talked with American political experts in Oslo, Norway, on Monday through Tuesday.  Then on Wednesday, the freshly elected Moon Jae-in, who advocates engagement with Pyongyang, was sworn in as the new president of the Republic of Korea.  At least for now, a temporary relaxation in the once inflammable tensions in the area looks credible, thanks to such precious highlights in the bleak geopolitical landscape of Northeast Asia.  Even better, the region has a precious opportunity to heal some of its most damaging recent rifts.  Although Pyongyang keeps clamoring it will conduct its sixth nuclear test ""at any time"", and it is ready to enter a nuclear duel with the United States. Although Washington has distanced itself from the Oslo talks, and ruled out any change to its preoccupation with ""maximum pressures"" on the DPRK. And although it remains to be seen how far Moon can overcome the potential drags at home in Parliament, where his party lacks a majority, when he does reach out to the DPRK.  Given US President Donald Trump's recent indication of his willingness to meet DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, who knows whether or not the informal contact in Oslo will pave the way for more formal, direct engagement?  After all, the White House has left that door open; Pyongyang craves it; Beijing would welcome it; and it would certainly be in Seoul's interests. Coordination with Washington then will be Moon's foremost foreign policy challenge.  Since it is anticipated he will take a milder approach to the DPRK than his predecessor, he will have to first straighten things out with decision-makers in Washington, who until now have favored imposing further isolation and sanctions.  Moon's expressed disfavor toward the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is certainly conducive to his aspiration for repairing his country's strained ties with China. It is hoped that he has the ability to maneuver a meaningful change to the current impasse.  Yet if their shared interest in peacefully denuclearizing the peninsula does lead to constructive interaction among stakeholders, and the threat from across the 38th Parallel diminishes, Moon surely can make a stronger case for removing THAAD.  For if THAAD is meant solely and specifically to address escalating threats from the DPRK, why should it stay if such threats de-escalate?         "
Tsai trying to hijack Taiwan's public health for political aims,5/10/2017,"                              Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan, Wednesday, April 15, 2015. [Photo/IC]      Obviously Tsai Ing-wen was frustrated and found no better way to vent her disappointment at Taiwan's failure to receive an invitation from the World Health Assembly, which will open in Geneva on May 22.        In her 10th tweet on the matter on Monday, the leader of Taiwan tried to justify Taiwan's participation, knowing full well that will not happen.  She is reportedly dispatching a group of 20 to the WHA venue. Yet given the status quo of relations across the Taiwan Straits, it is actually impossible for Tsai's envoys to be admitted into the meeting. Tsai and her colleagues know that, especially after their abortive attempt last year.  Chances are the ""delegation"" they are sending will make a scene, as happened last year, and try everything possible to convey the message that Taiwan ""is being bullied"", and public health on the island is being put in jeopardy.  Such a narrative may resonate with some who sympathize but have no knowledge of the whole story. But at the end of the day, even these sympathizers will realize this is nothing but another episode in Tsai's game of autotomy-she is seeking to hijack public health in Taiwan to serve her political end of winning de facto statehood recognition for the island.  Tsai's argument for Taiwan's participation is misleading because it ignores the essential premise that the World Health Organization meeting is inter-governmental by nature, and that Taiwan is not a sovereign entity.  Taiwan did participate in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2015. But that was under a special arrangement worked out by both sides of the Straits under the 1992 Consensus that both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China. But the island's presence was never unconditional. That it participated in the name of ""Chinese Taipei"" and in the capacity of observer says it all.  Now the condition that allowed that goodwill arrangement does not exist under Tsai, who obstinately refuses to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, there is certainly no legal basis for Tsai's argument. The mainland's position, on the other hand, has the full support of United Nations Assembly resolution 2758 and WHA resolution 25.1.  Tsai's argument is also porous because she is intentionally exaggerating the negative impacts of Taiwan's absence from the WHA. Public health professionals from Taiwan enjoy full access to WHA meetings and activities at the technical level. The WHO can also dispatch experts to the island to provide professional guidance when necessary.  Such exchanges were never an issue even pre-2009. Why should they be now?         "
Macron's French election win bodes well for ties with China,5/9/2017,"                              French President-elect Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech at his campaign headquarters after early results in the second round in the 2017 French presidential election in Paris on Sunday. Lionel Bonaventure / Reuters      The victory of independent centrist Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election run-off on Sunday has allowed those worried about rising right-wing nationalism in Europe to heave a sigh of relief.        With Macron winning just over 66 percent of the votes, it is evident that his message of a strong and progressive Europe struck a chord with voters, even after the populist victories of the leave campaign in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump's election as US president.  His triumph strengthens France's place as one of the central pillars of the European Union, and bodes well for what it stands for: open trade, the free flow of people and cooperation.  Macron's victory, therefore, was also a victory for reason over extremism.  Yet he still faces many challenges ahead. The country has deep economic and social divisions, with a high unemployment rate, especially among the young people. And the abstention rate of around 25 percent, highest this century, and a record share of blank or spoiled ballots by more than 11 percent of the voters, show many felt neither Macron nor his opponent, anti-EU, anti-immigration Marine Le Pen, was speaking for them.  Meanwhile, France is still in a state of emergency following a string of terrorist attacks since 2015 that have killed more than 230 people. All of which mean it will not be easy for Macron to deliver on his message of change, hope, unity and healing.  One source of support could be China.  As President Xi Jinping said in a congratulatory message to the French president-elect immediately after his election win, both nations have significant strategic importance and international influence and share a responsibility for maintaining peace and facilitating development in the world.  Sino-French relations have been developing healthily and steadily in recent years, and there is ample common ground for win-win cooperation between China and France. Not least in the economic arena where Macron has pledged to promote globalization and free trade, for which China has now become the torchbearer.  There is also much space for improvement in their trade relations, which lag significantly behind Sino-German trade.  And as Macron noted previously, China can also be ""an important ally"" to France and Europe in tackling climate change and fighting terrorism.  Working together, as Xi proposed in his message, will ""move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level"". This will benefit not only the two countries and peoples, but also global stability and development.         "
Initiative also seeks to connect different peoples and cultures,5/8/2017,"                                The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation is scheduled to be held in Beijing on May 14 and 15. As well as consolidating the international consensus for sustainable and inclusive development, the China-proposed initiative is forging stronger bonds among participating countries and promoting more mutual understanding between peoples with different cultural backgrounds.        Three years in the making, the initiative has expanded from its original design of being a way to create greater infrastructure connectivity and promote trade and investment, and it now embraces people-to-people and cultural exchanges to forge greater understanding and friendship.  China has signed agreements on cultural exchanges with many of the participating countries and carried out various bilateral cultural activities. It has also inked agreements with 24 countries involved in the initiative for mutual recognition of university degrees and other credentials.  China hopes deepened cooperation with participating countries in such fields as education, culture and tourism will help promote greater inclusiveness and openness, which in turn will provide intrinsic momentum to strengthen international collaboration under the framework of the Belt and Road.  The ancient land and maritime Silk Road routes used to serve as a nexus for international trade and cultural exchanges. Today, the world is in dire need of more communication and better understanding between different cultures, religions and civilizations.  Almost all the problems and crises facing the world today have their roots in a lack of communication and understanding. China's Belt and Road Initiative provides both a new vision and unique solutions for the world to achieve the goals of openness and shared development that are essential to counter the exclusiveness and intolerance that brew distrust and conflict.  The initiative embraces extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, which can help forge a community of shared destiny.  As President Xi Jinping has said on many occasions, the relationship between two countries is based on the affection between the two peoples, and stronger bonds at the people-to-people level can better unite peoples.  At the upcoming international forum, representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to explore ways to promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges.  Interactions along the ancient Silk Road shaped its spirit of commerce, which was not just the trade in commodities but also the impulse of inquiry and the interchange of cultures and ideas. Today, the Belt and Road Initiative embodies that spirit in its pursuit of solidarity and mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit, and its willingness to learn from others.         "
Japan's divisive TPP move seems mission impossible,5/5/2017,"                              Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]      During this week's meeting of the chief negotiators for the 11 countries remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which was held in Toronto, Canada, on Tuesday and Wednesday, it became clear that Japan is keen to take over the helm relinquished by the United States, and it is pushing hard for the deal to be executed on time.  Tokyo's enthusiasm for the much weakened, if not dying, multilateral pact, is clearly politically motivated.  From the very beginning, the US-initiated pact, which was part of the previous administration's pivot to the Asia-Pacific, has borne the hallmarks of political calculation, as China, the world's second-largest economy, was deliberately excluded from what was claimed to be a pure economic arrangement.  And for Japan, which is already locked in a bitter maritime territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea, the TPP has emerged as another way for it to compete with China for influence in the region. So after newly installed US President Donald Trump pulled the plug on the deal, saying it was not in the US' best interests, Japan, fearing China would fill the vacuum left by the US and further expand its sphere of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, has been keen to keep the deal alive.  But, no matter how much Japan tries to breathe new life into the deal, with the withdrawal of the US, the future of the TPP looks bleak.  The 11 remaining Pacific-rim countries that agreed to the US-led deal are not united behind Japan's purpose, with Peru, for instance, having made public the idea of bringing China into the partnership. Not to mention that, without the US, the combined GDP of the remaining members now accounts for only 13 percent of the world's total, which reduces the significance of the pact.  In fact, sooner or later Japan will find it mission impossible to revive the TPP, let alone use it as a tool to contain China.  Nor does its anxiety over its neighbor's rise reflect the mainstream view of China as an important upholder of free trade and globalization.  In the face of the sluggish global economic recovery and growing protectionism, China has been increasingly looked upon as an important force to counter the fragmentation caused by such non-inclusive trade arrangements as the TPP.  Instead of adopting a divisive stance, China remains steadfast in vigorously working for an innovative, interconnected and inclusive regional and global economy, as proved by its advocating of negotiations on the more inclusive Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and its advancing of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Trump's DPRK stance offers Abe a way to achieve his aim,5/4/2017,"                              SHI YU/CHINA DAILY      Calling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader a ""pretty smart cookie"", and displaying amazing readiness to personally meet him, United States President Donald Trump has apparently softened his rhetoric, prompting some to imagine that once unlikely scenario might happen.  Although the White House was quick to roll back, shifting the limelight onto the ""right circumstances"", which spokesperson Sean Spicer said ""are not there right now"", Trump's remark is in line with his new-found determination to find a resolution to the DPRK issue.        Although the once clear-and-present danger of military conflict no longer seems as imminent, with both Pyongyang and Washington demonstrating restraint. It has not disappeared, and the road to denuclearization remains long and tortuous.  Not just because the US and the DPRK remain trapped in a vicious circle. In response to the latest military drill conducted by the US and the Republic of Korea-during which two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers joined forces with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and nuclear-powered submarines-Pyongyang accused Washington of pushing the peninsula to the ""brink of nuclear war"" through ""reckless military provocation"". And we have had earfuls of that following each nuclear or missile test by Pyongyang.  But also because the inevitable toll of any military action on the ROK weighs heavily on all decision-makers, and makes it extremely difficult to justify using force. That may be why the White House has chosen to remain somewhat vague and refrained from drawing a redline, despite its desire to mount maximum pressure.  The most likely outcome, then, is the US and other stakeholders find themselves bogged down in protracted debate over a feasible way to translate their wishes for a peaceful solution into acceptable-to-all actions, while the DPRK continues with its brinkmanship while avoiding crossing what it perceives to be the US' bottom line.  As a result, the DPRK will likely advance its nuclear weapons goals, even accomplish them. That would mean Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe claiming justification for putting to rest his country's war-renouncing Constitution.  Abe has already managed to demolish legal constraints on ""collective self-defense"" without violating Article 9, and lifted the long-standing ban on weapons exports.  On Monday, he reiterated the need to revise the county's Constitution, citing tensions in the region. On the same day, Japan dispatched one of its largest warships to protect a US navy supply vessel.  To borrow a line from Trump, Pyongyang ""will have good missiles"", if the current stalemate persists.  Abe, on the other hand, can ride the waves of confrontation and see his dream come true, without contributing anything substantial to end the stalemate.         "
South China Sea should not block regional cooperation,5/3/2017,"                      A Chinese naval fleet completed a three-day visit to the Philippines on Monday. The first such visit in seven years provides the latest proof of the two countries' resolve to continuously expand bilateral interaction and deepen political mutual trust.  After paying a visit to the Chinese warship docked in his hometown of Davao City, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he is open to the idea of conducting joint military exercises with China. This trust-building gesture is just one of the many examples set by the Philippine leader in his efforts to improve ties with China.  Since taking office in July, Duterte has been seeking to dispel the bad blood in bilateral ties and to usher in a cordial atmosphere so both countries can put behind them their skirmishes over maritime disputes, which were exacerbated during the tenure of his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, and advance their cooperation in a wide range of fields.  Thanks to the efforts of both sides, the relationship between Beijing and Manila is in a much better shape now, and tensions in their South China Sea disputes have subsequently abated.  As this year's chair of the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Philippines, under Duterte, has also played a constructive role in pushing for greater consensus among the members of the bloc to resolve the South China Sea disputes through peaceful negotiations.  The ASEAN summit statement delivered by Duterte on Sunday did not include strong wording about the South China Sea issue, which marked a major departure from the provocative attitudes and deeds of the previous Philippine government.  Beijing and Manila have also agreed to establish two-way consultation on the South China Sea issue. Their first bilateral meeting is scheduled for this month, and diplomats from both countries will discuss issues of common concern and the promotion of maritime and security cooperation.  Meanwhile, China and ASEAN are working hard to complete the drafting of a framework for the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea by midyear. At this important juncture, it would be counterproductive for any party to act in an irresponsible way.  Even with the rosier picture for bilateral ties, it is not surprising that there are still some differences between the two countries. Last month, remarks by the Philippine side on disputed isles in the South China Sea caused unnecessary concern.  Greater communication and engagement would bridge the differences and enable both sides to cherish the hard-won fruits in bilateral ties and pursue more.         "
Don't pit 'One Country' against 'Two Systems',5/2/2017,"                      The legal chief of Beijing's representative office in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has rebuffed insinuations that the central government is trying to ""mainlandize"" Hong Kong.  Speaking at a symposium in the city on Sunday, Wang Zhenmin, director of law at the Central People's Government Liaison Office in the SAR, rejected the notion that Beijing is not adhering to the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and instead asserted it sincerely wants the policy to do well.  His comments come ahead of the 20th anniversary of the territory's return to the motherland, and at a time when certain forces with ulterior motives are trying to mislead the Hong Kong public by claiming ""two systems"" takes precedence over ""one country"".  This is nonsense, as the Basic Law makes clear in its very first article-Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China.  The principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"" was designed in the best interests of Hong Kong as well as of the country as a whole, but as the Basic Law makes clear, even though it enjoys a high degree of autonomy, the SAR is a local administrative region of the People's Republic of China.  ""One Country"" is the basis and precondition for ""Two Systems"", meaning without ""One Country"" there would be no grounds for talking about ""Two Systems"" in Hong Kong. That's because ""Two Systems"" refers to the mainland's socialist system and Hong Kong's capitalist system, which coexist in ""One Country""-the People's Republic of China.  Both Hong Kong and the mainland have been benefiting from their complementary relationship since 1997. With the advent of ""globalization"" it has never been more apparent that Hong Kong's economy must take advantage of being closely linked to that of the mainland, now the second largest in the world. The gathering momentum of the Belt and Road Initiative promises new opportunities for Hong Kong to excel as a hub for financial and other services.  The ""One Country, Two Systems"" is tailor-made for Hong Kong to continue to prosper as part of China without having to change its capitalist system or way of life. The central government will keep its promise and has shown nothing but unreserved support for the SAR whenever necessary. No one with a sensible mind can deny the nature of ""One Country, Two Systems"" or believe the latter can stand without the former.              "
Provocations push tensions to the brink,5/1/2017,"                      Hours after a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear issue, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reportedly test-fired a ballistic missile on Saturday, which exploded after liftoff. Pyongyang's repeated testing of the international community's patience will lead to severe consequences that will increasingly be hard for it to swallow.  Its blatant violation of Security Council resolutions constitutes an act of open defiance to the international community's resolve to denuclearize the peninsula and points to the urgency of tackling both the symptoms and the root cause of the issue.  A vicious circle of provocation and retaliation has reigned in recent months, with Pyongyang pushing its nuclear and missile programs while the United States and the Republic of Korea resorting to massive military exercises and the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in the ROK.  As a result, the degree of distrust and enmity has reached the highest it's been in years between the contested parties on the peninsula. One miscalculation and one misstep would easily push the two sides, separated by the Demilitarized Zone, to the brink of war.  At this stage, both sides should exercise utmost restraint because a head-on clash, even if a limited one, would lead to a costly price that neither side could afford to pay. Before diplomatic means are exhausted, those who have a penchant of trumpeting war rhetoric are being neither responsible to themselves nor others.  Pyongyang should awaken from the fantasy that its pursuit of nuclear capabilities and a missile program will bring it peace and security, as it has left the world community little choices but to tighten nonmilitary measures to rein in its dangerous ambition.  The country should know it is playing a dangerous and counterproductive game of provocation, which can backfire and reduce the chance for diplomatic mediation. In fact, its constant and escalating provocations have eroded the patience of stakeholders on the peninsula to defuse tensions through peaceful means.  Meanwhile, the US and ROK also need to do their part, and stop military threats and deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which is the practical way to mitigate distrust and defuse tensions so as to create the conditions for communication and dialogue.  Yet, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out in the UN Security Council meeting, no matter what happens, we should never waiver in our commitment to the goal of denuclearization.  A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is the basic precondition for its long-term peace and stability, which caters to the interests of all parties as it is the only way to dispel reasonable concerns of all stakeholders, including DPRK and ROK, and this should be the right direction for all parties to strive for.

THAAD only hinders efforts to denuclearize peninsula,4/28/2017,"                              File photo shows Seoungju residents chant slogans during a protest against the government's decision on deploying a US THAAD anti-missile defense unit in Seongju, in Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2016. The banner reads ""Desperately oppose deploying THAAD"". [Photo/Agencies]    The militaries of the United States and the Republic of Korea are accelerating installation of the controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system south of Seoul.    If, as US Pacific Command chief Harry Harris claimed, THAAD is expected to be operational ""in the coming days"", there is little chance of it being suspended because of protests from Beijing and Moscow, even though it comes at a time when Washington and its allies want them to commit more comprehensively and deeply to coordinated moves.  Although the official excuse has been Pyongyang's wayward stuntsmanship and the threat it poses, making THAAD a fait accompli and pre-empting any change of mind from the next administration in Seoul may be a more powerful driver behind the rush to get THAAD up and running in the ROK.  Of course, Beijing and Moscow have valid reasons to protest, because the advanced system upsets the regional strategic balance and its radar undermines Chinese and Russian security interests, even though both the US and the ROK claim otherwise.  And since the deployment of THAAD in the ROK is now seemingly done and dusted, China and Russia have no choice but to respond.  Yet, whatever form that takes, it will not be the end of the story, since the nascent coalition against Pyongyang's nuclear/missile program is likely to be collateral damage from the intransigence of Washington and Seoul.  Beijing and Moscow are in the same boat with Washington and its regional allies on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula thanks to a shared security interest. And in the White House's latest rhetoric on Korean Peninsula denuclearization, China and Russia are referred to as ""partners in the region"", indicating unprecedented eagerness for a united front.  Beijing, however, has been identified as crucial to dissuading the DPRK from continuing along the path it has chosen. So much so that Washington seems to believe that Beijing alone can make a dramatic difference.  Beijing, on its part, has been consistent in adherence to diplomacy and pursuing a nuclear-free peninsula with the united efforts of all stakeholders.  The push to make THAAD operational in the ROK, however, creates a serious distraction for Beijing, because it represents a new security threat to it, one it must now address as a matter of urgency.  Washington and Seoul claim Beijing is misreading the situation and overreacting, but that is because they are not willing to take Beijing's concerns seriously and have not looked at the matter from Beijing's perspective.  Seoul does not seem to care what this means in the long run. But THAAD threatens to permanently change the regional landscape and only adds new dynamics to a situation that was already complex and requiring of careful handling.               "
New carrier does not mean change to defense policy,4/27/2017,"                              China officially launches its second -- and the first domestically developed -- aircraft carrier on Apr 26, 2017, in Dalian, Liaoning province. [Photo/Xinhua]    The launch on Wednesday of China's first totally home-built aircraft carrier marks a major step forward for its military modernization, and highlights the technical progress the country has made over the past several decades.    The carrier, which is expected to enter service in 2020, is the country's second. Its first was bought secondhand and refitted, and is now used for training purposes.  However, it would be wrong, or ill-intentioned, to perceive the new vessel as evidence of the ""China threat"" so beloved of some.  As it has integrated more closely with the rest of the world, the interests that China has beyond its borders have grown commensurately. Building a strong defense capability with a widespread global reach is now necessary to protect China's businesses and the massive interests that arise from them.  Also despite its growing overseas interests, China's top priority remains national rejuvenation and its most important task is still domestic development. Its defense policies are therefore first and foremost aimed at ensuring a peaceful external environment and providing a security guarantee for its own economic development and social progress.  To safeguard its national security, territorial integrity and development interests, China is therefore committed to meeting the strategic requirement of defending offshore waters and protecting the open seas, and building a multi-functional and efficient navy.  Aircraft carriers are the proven way to accomplish these tasks.  If anything, China is late in joining the club of nations that have aircraft carriers. The world's second-largest economy is the last among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council whose navies have carrier groups. Even its Asian neighbors, India and Thailand, have had aircraft carriers in service for several decades.  And China's long-delayed deployment of an aircraft carrier lies in sharp contrast with the increasing role that it is playing in international affairs.  Its navy has joined in multinational anti-piracy patrols off Somalia since 2008, escorting thousands of foreign and Chinese cargo ships through the risky waters. China is also the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, with more than 2,400 peacekeeping personnel in service worldwide.  An advanced navy equipped with aircraft carriers will definitely help the nation better fulfill its international responsibilities.  Criticizing China for adding aircraft carriers to its naval capabilities simply raises the question of why it should be a concern to those questioning an action that is long overdue.               "
US welcome to join Belt and Road Initiative,4/26/2017,"                              Cui Tiankai, ambassador to the US (center), Walt Disney Studios Vice-President Paul Baribault (left) and Chinese documentary director Lu Chuan (second from the left) display a poster for Born in China, a Chinese-American coproduction that takes viewers on an epic journey into the wilds of the country. The film was released in the United States over the weekend.Zhao Huanxin / China Daily    At a forum held in New York on Monday, China's Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai invited Washington to join the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.    In his words, the initiative, aimed at building infrastructure connectivity, and thus boosting free trade and people-to-people exchanges across Asia, Africa and Europe, is not China's ""solo show"". Rather, it will be a ""symphony"" performed by all participating countries, the US included if it chooses to join.  The initiative offers a platform for countries to join hands to cultivate fresh impetus for global growth and explore a more sustainable development path together.  However, the US has been suspicious of the initiative, if not openly antagonistic toward it, since President Xi Jinping first proposed reinvigorating the ancient Silk Road trade routes in 2013, with some in the US claiming it is an attempt by China to challenge the US' global leadership. That is why Washington has refused to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has been established to finance Belt and Road projects.  But such concerns stem from an outdated Cold War view of the world, which tends to pit great powers against each other in a zero-sum game, rather than recognize the plentiful opportunities that exist for win-win cooperation.  The initiative embraces the principles of wide consultation, joint construction and shared benefits, and aims to promote the construction of a fairer global economic governance system. It is open and inclusive, and complements, rather than replaces, the existing international governance mechanisms orchestrated by the US. There is really nothing for the US to take exception to.  Indeed, it has nothing to lose by joining the initiative. Instead, by joining it, the US will be able to secure investment to improve its own outdated infrastructure and reap the benefits of the huge business opportunities that the initiative promises to create.  Meantime, the world faces tremendous challenges such as poverty, terrorism and energy security that cannot be adequately addressed without a China-US partnership that ensures better functioning of the existing international order. The US' participation in the Belt and Road Initiative would enable China and the US to work more closely together to better fulfill their international responsibilities.  Despite their differences, the two countries have already built a resilient relationship featuring extensive cooperation in many areas. If reason prevails, the US should realize that it would be in its own interest to be part of the network of global partnerships that are being formed by the Belt and Road Initiative.               "
Misjudgment of situation biggest risk to peninsula,4/25/2017,"                              A submarine-launched ballistic missile is displayed during a military parade in central Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    If the risks surrounding the Korean Peninsula were perceived to be dangerously high, it was because of the fear that anything could happen at any time in the tense standoff that had developed between Washington and Pyongyang.    But now that the Donald Trump administration has demonstrated impressive patience for diplomacy-despite its announcement of the end to an ""era of strategic patience""-and it is seeking closer engagement with peace-minded China on the matter, the risks would appear to have abated considerably.  However, the situation is still inflammable.  For as the sanctions imposed by the United Nations begin to bite deeper, the possibility that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea might become reckless out of desperation has never been higher.  Not just the immediate stakeholders, but the whole world is holding its breath on Tuesday, the 85th Anniversary of the Korean People's Army, waiting to see whether Pyongyang will conduct another nuclear test, or major missile launch.  Of course a nuclear test, or missile launch, would not constitute the ""full-out war"" Pyongyang has threatened. And, despite its constant threats, Pyongyang would not embark on such a suicidal course unless it was left with no choice.  In contrast to Pyongyang's war rhetoric, Washington appears very much in line with Beijing on pursuing a peaceful resolution, at least for now.  Beijing has remained constant in advocating no-war, no-chaos on the Korean Peninsula. In his latest phone conversation with Trump on Monday, President Xi Jinping once again stated that position, appealing for restraint at this crucial juncture.  Judging from their recent words and deeds, policymakers in Pyongyang have seriously misread the UN sanctions, which are aimed at its nuclear/missile provocations, not its system or leadership. They have unfairly misrepresented Beijing's role in the process, disregarding its preoccupation with peace, humanitarian concerns and non-interference in the DPRK's domestic affairs. And they have greatly underestimated the international community's-not just any individual stakeholder's-political will to denuclearize the peninsula.  They are at once perilously overestimating their own strength and underestimating the hazards they are brewing for themselves.  They need to reassess the situation so they do not make any misjudgments.  Likewise Washington should continue to exercise restraint and pursue a peaceful resolution to the issue.  There have already been enough shows of force and confrontation, it is time for Pyongyang and Washington to take a step back from their previous rhetoric and instead heed the voices of reason calling for peaceful denuclearization of the peninsula.

Move to protect US steelmakers is against norms of world trade,4/24/2017,"                              A worker at a steel company in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, in January 2015. [Photo/China Daily]    Announcing that the United States will investigate whether foreign steel imports harm the country's national security, US President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have sent an unmistakable message to the big US steelmakers that they will protect them.    National security is rightly a top priority for any country, so it would be understandable if the Trump administration was taking the move to close any potential national security loopholes. But it is not.  Trump on Thursday revealed that the move had been taken simply to help bring back manufacturing jobs to the US, one of his key campaign promises.  ""For decades America has lost our jobs and our factories to unfair foreign trade,"" Trump said. ""And one steel mill after another has been shut down, abandoned, and closed. And we're going to reverse that.""  What he did not say is that the US' manufacturing decline does not come from unfair competition from foreign producers, rather, it is a natural outcome of the country's high labor costs and domestic market-driven economic restructuring over the past decades.  It is clear that national security is only an excuse to justify the real aim of blocking foreign products to benefit the domestic steel industry. The probe, which will be led by Ross, could result in recommendations on curbing steel imports that will affect the interests of a number of the US' major trade partners, including China.  Yet reducing imports of foreign steel products will not alter the weak competitiveness of US steelmakers. Instead, if the US does take protectionist measures, then other countries are likely to take justifiable retaliatory actions against US companies that have an advantage over those countries in fields such as finance and high-tech, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war that benefits no one.  Trade is indispensible for healthy and sustainable global growth. When disputes arise, the involved parties should resort to the dispute settlement mechanism under the World Trade Organization. It may not be perfect for settling trade disputes, but it is the best mechanism there is to maintain order in the global trade system.  By proposing an unjustified investigation into steel imports in the guise of safeguarding national security, the US seems to be resorting to unilateralism to solve bilateral and multilateral problems.  Unfortunately, it will be hard for it to revitalize its steel industry and the move is only likely to arouse anger from its trade partners, contributing further instability to global trade and the world economy.

No party can fulfill peninsula peacemission single-handedly,4/21/2017,"                              Soldiers attend a military parade in central Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    Even as US Vice-President Mike Pence reiterated the era of ""strategic patience"" is over. Even as Pyongyang pledges to conduct another nuclear test ""at any time"", and carry out missile tests on ""a weekly, monthly and yearly basis"". The most impressive progress so far regarding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear/missile threats is the United States' latest indication that it, too, prefers a peaceful solution.    China, Russia and the US finally seem to have reached a consensus on the proper approach to a common headache.  Their shared concern brought the three together to endorse the condemnations and sanctions of the United Nations. Divergences in their approaches, however, left loopholes that have undermined the effectiveness of the sanctions.  Whether because of restraint or inability, that the usually provocative Pyongyang did not conduct an anticipated nuclear test last weekend has been followed by considerable easing in the tense standoff once broadly seen as nearing breaking point.  The relative calm that now exists offers a precious window of opportunity for stakeholders serious about perpetuating it. It will not last long.  It is hard to imagine that Pyongyang will forsake its nuclear pursuit, because that is the only leverage, or bargaining chip, it has.  Pyongyang may soon fire another missile, even detonate another nuclear device, if it sees no immediate threat. It can't afford extreme tensions, but neither can it live without them.  The constant growth of the DPRK nuclear threat testifies to the need for solidarity among key stakeholders, China, Russia, the US and Republic of Korea in particular. Their failure to get Pyongyang to toe the line originates in large part from their inability to speak in one voice.  The continuous difficulty in maneuvering major-power unanimity on the wording of a new UN condemnation at the Security Council is indicative of the diverse concerns setting them apart.  Now that even the once tough-talking Donald Trump is onboard for a peaceful solution, and all parties except Pyongyang want a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, the prospect has never been so bright for dissuading Pyongyang without the use of force.  Beijing has demonstrated due enthusiasm for Washington's newfound interest in a diplomatic solution and willingness to work more closely with it. But as the evolution of the state of affairs on the peninsula has shown, no party can fulfill the mission single-handedly.  Washington must be aware of the limitations to Beijing's abilities, and refrain from assuming that the matter can be consigned entirely to Beijing alone.               "
Dots of isolated incidents reveal rising militarist trend,4/20/2017,"                                    Members of a right wing group arrive at the Yasukuni Shrine to pay respects to Japan's war dead in Tokyo, Aug 15, 2013. [Photo/IC]    Viewed in isolation, Japan's decision to allow schools to use Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf as teaching material might not be unacceptable.    After all, the German dictator's notorious autobiography could be studied as part of anti-Nazi education and serious retrospection of Japan's own militarist past.  It has ignited worries, however, because there is no sign that is the intention of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his administration. Instead, it looks more like the latest episode in a prolonged sequence of moves in the opposite direction.  Earlier this month, the Abe Cabinet gave the green light to the use of the 1890 Imperial Rescript on Education in classrooms. While Abe is keen on cultivating patriotic citizenship in present-day Japan, the Imperial Rescript is better known for preaching the core tenets of a militarist education.  Shortly before that, the Japanese Education Ministry chose to incorporate jukendo, or bayonet fighting-another component of militarist education-in the junior high school curriculum.  There are ways to carry out anti-Nazi education without giving prominence to Hitler's toxic writing. There are other ways to cultivate patriotism without reinstating the Imperial Rescript on Education. And there are other ways to promote sportsmanship and strengthen student physique without practicing jukendo.  But the current Japanese administration appears obsessed with that particular period of their country's history. They have even been naming new vessels of Maritime Self-Defense Force after those of the Imperial Japanese Navy.  On March 22, the MDF's latest, largest helicopter frigate came into service, bearing the name Kaga, which was the name of an aircraft carrier in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Four years ago, the MDF launched its newest helicopter destroyer carrying the name Izumo, whose namesake was the flagship of the Japanese fleet that participated in the invasion of China during the war of aggression against China.  Down this path, it may not take long before there is a full reincarnation of the Imperial Japanese Navy-in names at least.  Some seeing the rebirth of a single name from the rather distant past may consider it to be not worth any fuss.  But when all these seemingly trivial dots are joined together, a pattern emerges.  And the ugly collage looks even uglier against the backdrop of the Abe administration's persistent endeavors to whitewash Japanese war atrocities and dismantle its pacifist Constitution.  Abe's diplomacy has distracted many from the rightist tendencies in Japan. But looking aside from what is happening there could prove a costly mistake.         "
Belt and Road forum will add to what initiative entails,4/19/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping delivers a speech to Indonesian lawmakers at the House of Representatives of Indonesia in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Oct 3, 2013. [Photo/Xinhua]    The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which is scheduled for May 14-15 in Beijing, presents the world with a golden opportunity to seek cross-continental development cooperation featuring inclusiveness and openness.    With the theme ""Boosting Cooperation and Realizing Win-Win Development"", the forum will give fresh impetus to collaborative efforts to realize a more balanced, equitable and inclusive development model.  First proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road have won wide support from the international community, and there is now a broad international consensus on quickening the implementation of the initiative.  Representatives from 110 countries, including 28 heads of state and government, will attend next month's gathering, showing that the ""circle of friends"" being forged by the initiative continues to expand.  Although led by China, the connotations of the initiative, originally aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa, have been further enriched and substantiated by other participants, and China hopes the international forum will continue that process.  Participating countries can elaborate on ways to integrate the initiative into their own development strategies; key areas of cooperation in such fields as connectivity, trade and investment, finance and people-to-people exchanges can be identified; and the form of a long-term cooperation mechanism can be explored.  And although initiated by China-proof of its strong sense of responsibility and its willingness to provide a Chinese solution to global development challenges-it is not a ""membership club"", as Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out on Tuesday. Hence, rather than being a geopolitical tool it is perhaps the most inclusive platform for cooperation the world has ever witnessed.  Admittedly, the world does not lack multilateral mechanisms for regional or international cooperation. But, more often than not, they are fragmented and exclusive. And with growing uncertainties and angst about the prospects for the world economy and a backlash against globalization, there is, as Xi has said, a need to revisit and change the current paths of development.  The Belt and Road Initiative offers the means to do just that, by timely opening up a new horizon for the world to achieve common development through win-win cooperation.  Now all countries can take part in the initiative in ways they deem appropriate, and in doing so, share the benefits. For the ambitious initiative is not just empty words, it is an overarching vision that embraces practical projects and measures to promote interconnectivity and sustainable development.

Better than expected growth shows economy has resilience,4/18/2017,"                              A worker at a plant in Xingtai, North China's Hebei province, Jan 25, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    The 6.9 percent economic growth China recorded in the first quarter of this year beat market expectations. Before the figure was released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, many analysts had expected the economy to expand 6.8 percent in the January-March period, the same rate as in the last quarter of 2016.    The slightly improved figure results from many factors, including increased government infrastructure spending, a booming housing market, robust industrial output, a rebound in exports and strong retail sales.  The impressive performance in the first quarter lays a good foundation for the government to achieve this year's annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.  It should also help allay concerns that China's economy might be heading for a hard-landing, as some international analysts have forecast, citing weak external demand, contracting manufacturing activities and surging government debts.  That worry, though far from reality, is understandable given that China has been the engine that has powered the global economy for many years.  However, the doomsayers overlook the resilience of China's economy. As the first quarter's economic performance signals, China's growth remains stable, and its transition away from low-end manufacturing and investment-led expansion to a higher position in the global production chain and domestic consumption as a growth driver, is well on track.  There is still the need to keep a close eye on the situation both at home and abroad, though, as challenges remain from the complicated external environment and domestic structural problems.  For instance, as the government steps in to rein in the property market that shows signs of overheating and tighten bank lending policies, the effect of cheap credit to propel growth will diminish.  And there are hard tasks ahead. The government has to continue cutting overcapacity, reducing inventory, eliminating money-losing ""zombie enterprises"" and encouraging innovation to make the country's economy more sustainable.  So rather than relying on debt-fuelled stimulus, more efforts have to be made to release the dividends of reform and the potential of domestic consumer spending to drive growth.  The 7 percent growth in disposable income in the first quarter, the fastest since the end of 2015, highlights the strong endogenous consumption potential.  The better-than-expected growth provides a good springboard to continue to pursue a growth model that relies on consumption, services and innovation, rather than investment and exports. This will make China's economy even more sustainable, and ensure more balanced and healthy growth that benefits all.               "
"War can be avoided, but further restraint needed",4/17/2017,"                              A submarine-launched ballistic missile is displayed during a military parade in central Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      If ordering the missile strike on Syrian targets, dropping the ""mother of all bombs"" in Afghanistan, and assembling a war-ready armada off the Korean Peninsula were all meant to convey Donald Trump's message that things are different with him in the White House, what happened Saturday might well be Kim Jong-un's way of saying ""message received"".  Either because it chose to resort to a less provocative form of show of defiance, or it is technically not ready, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not carry out the widely anticipated sixth nuclear test. Instead, it launched another projectile, type unidentified, which failed.  Given the DPRK leader's pledge of ""ultra-toughness"" in response to the US' ""toughness"", he had to simultaneously avoid being seen as softening under US pressure and crossing the perceived US redline-conducting a new nuclear test. Firing a missile of some sort was thus a calculated move, and making it without prompting a furious response from Washington surely qualifies as a win to some degree from Kim's perspective.  Trump, too, can claim a win. That the nuclear test did not happen will surely be seen as the pressure working.  That Pyongyang kept tensions from reaching a dramatic climax can in some way be understood as a win for all parties concerned. At least they did not have to make the difficult decisions they would have had to if things had gone the other way.  The best part about the latest bout of Trump-Kim exchanges is both finally demonstrated rare restraint. The Trump administration has not excluded ""engagement"", though the current focus reportedly remains ""maximum pressure"". And Pyongyang's restoration of its foreign affairs committee was hardly coincidence.  That affirms the judgment that war, as imminent as it looked, is not unavoidable.  Neither the DPRK nor the United States wants war, at least not at this point, nor do the Republic of Korea, China and other stakeholders.  But it would be dangerous miscalculation if Pyongyang takes advantage of the relative easing in tensions and presses ahead with its brinkmanship, as it has done over the years. Washington's reported willingness to engage is conditional. And there is a strong, shared political will to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.  Washington did say it does not seek regime change. But that does not mean Pyongyang can indefinitely prolong its development of nuclear weapons.  There is a pressing need to de-escalate tensions and create conditions for diplomatic engagement, even if that is not immediate denuclearization talks.               "
