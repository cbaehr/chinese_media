          ","                          US President Donald Trump and the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un walk together before their working lunch during their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore, June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   As Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un and United States President Donald Trump prepare to meet in Hanoi on Wednesday and Thursday, it is worth reflecting on what has been achieved since Pyongyang and Seoul first broke the ice ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in the Republic of Korea in February last year.  Even the most skeptical would have to admit that the whirlwind series of meetings after that initial thaw in relations — which included two meetings between Kim and President Xi Jinping, and culminated in the historic first meeting between the sitting leaders of the DPRK and US in Singapore in June — was really quite remarkable.  Despite any claims to the contrary, there has been a sea change in the Korean Peninsula situation over the past year.  It is now up to Kim and Trump to keep the good momentum going and make the doomsayers eat their words by producing some end product in Hanoi.  Of course, goodwill will need to be reciprocal for that. Prior to his departure for Hanoi, Trump said he was in no rush and had no pressing schedule for Pyongyang's denuclearization, suggesting a more accommodative position on the more gradual approach that the DPRK has long favored. He has also signaled a possible softening of his stance on sanctions, saying they could be removed if there is meaningful progress on denuclearization.  Kim, on his part, said in his New Year speech that he wanted ""corresponding practical actions"" from the US.  All this has built up expectations that the two leaders will agree on concrete actions that can bridge the deep-rooted animosity and mistrust that have long existed between the two arch enemies.  But the crux of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue remains the security guarantee that Pyongyang seeks and which Washington has refused to give. If that guarantee is forthcoming and the US is willing to assist the DPRK in its efforts to promote economic development, beginning with the lifting of sanctions, there is no reason for Pyongyang not to focus on needed economic development.  It has not been easy for the Korean Peninsula peace process to have got this far, and China has been making great efforts to sustain the momentum that had been threatening to stall. Trump acknowledged this in a tweet on Sunday when he said Xi has ""been very helpful in his support"" of the Hanoi meeting.  China hopes Pyongyang and Washington will seize this opportunity to further promote peace and stability on the peninsula.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   Since last year, after the leaders of the two Koreas first set it in motion, a strong momentum of conciliation and engagement has eased the tensions over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear issue.  True, since last year's historic meeting with DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, US President Donald Trump has been under growing pressure at home, as critics say the meeting produced little of substance. And Kim had just begun to show a little impatience that his signaled change of focus from the development of nuclear weapons to economic development had not been met with accommodative actions from Washington until his request for a second meeting was met.  Dialogue between the two long antagonistic countries is clearly the way to put an end to their acrimony. So the fact that both sides have shown patience and good faith offers some reassurance that their get-together was not just a flash-in-the-pan meeting-of-minds and that fresh impetus can be attained in their upcoming face-to-face talks.  But concrete outcomes from their meeting — due to take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, next week — will be crucial to keep the process of engagement on track and moving forward.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that Trump's remark on Tuesday that he had ""no pressing time schedule"" for results on denuclearization are an acceptance that denuclearization will be a step-by-step, tit-for-tat process rather than a bid to exert pressure on Pyongyang by suggesting Washington can play a longer game.  Admittedly, his prediction that it would be ""very exciting"" suggests that something is in the works, with the possibility of a peace deal being mooted. Which would certainly be a historic achievement, and a very welcome one at that. The use-by date on the armistice that brought a cessation to the fighting on the peninsula in 1953 should have expired long ago with a final peace settlement.  Yet it is also to be hoped that by saying he is in ""no rush"", he does not intend to drag the process out and keep the bad blood simmering so that Washington can continue to claim there is a threat from Pyongyang as justification for its overbearing military presence in the region and for housing its missile defense systems in the Republic of Korea and Japan.  Whatever he might have meant, however, there are expectations that next week's meeting will reward the efforts of the international community, notably the ROK and China, to end the antagonism between the US and the DPRK through conciliation.  Given the complexity of the DPRK nuclear issue, it is unrealistic to anticipate the goal of denuclearization can be met through a couple of high-level meetings. But it is surely not too much to hope the two sides can keep the denuclearization ball visibly moving with some tangible give and take.         "
"Optimistic about Kim-Trump summit","

          ","                          US President Donald Trump meets with DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un on Sentosa Island, Singapore on June 12, 2018. [Photo/IC]   With the second summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump slated for February 27-28, there is hope the two sides will make further headway. But it will not yield a positive outcome if Washington pushes for “permanent, irreversible, verifiable” denuclearization and Pyongyang insists on lifting sanctions.  Since the first meeting, held in June in Singapore, the vaguely worded agreement signed between the two sides for denuclearization was proved abortive despite the statement made in the UN Security Council by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “Chairman Kim committed to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”. Kim fears “Vietnam model” denuclearization seeking a step-by-step quid pro quo.  With this in mind, a trust deficit still lingers between Pyongyang and Washington. On the one hand, the US side seems skeptical of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s seriousness about denuclearization and, on the other hand, Kim doubts the bona fide intention of Trump’s administration for pursuing a tit-for-tat deal. Building mutual trust is believed to be a prerequisite for reaching a fruitful consensus.  It is evident that seeking a package agreement and once-for-all denuclearization in one meeting or two is neither reasonable nor possible. It is unlikely to include all the prerequisites and conditions of denuclearization and Pyongyang’s demands, such as withdrawal of US troops from the Republic of Korea, the lifting of sanctions and guaranteeing the security of the DPRK, in a single package. Thus, a “phased” and “synchronous” approach will be promising.  For instance, the Trump administration seems unwilling to include a quick withdrawal of US troops from ROK in the talks but expects Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal “very quickly”, as he told reporters immediately after the Singapore summit.  In the upcoming summit, the negotiating sides have to chart a clear roadmap to delineate the process of denuclearization and lifting of sanctions as well as the demands and responsibilities of each side.  Regional stakeholders expect a more positive outcome of the summit and want both sides to reach an effective consensus. “For example, for DPRK to agree to international monitors checking and reporting on its nuclear weapons and facilities; and for the US to agree partially lift sanctions,” Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of Korean studies at Renmin University, is cited as saying. He reiterated Beijing’s support for the summit, which is a key step towards regional stability.  Overall, the Hanoi Summit will be productive for two reasons. First, from harsh rhetoric and Trump’s “fire and furry”, the two sides sit face-to-face to resolve the insurmountable issue through negotiations. Such reconciliatory approach will put an end to the cold war and mitigate regional stability.  Second, the two sides are hoped to reach an agreement on denuclearization process, lifting sanctions on DPRK, formal ending to the 1950-53 Korean War, giving security guarantees to the DPRK, and establishing new relations between the US and DPRK. Although it is unlikely to have all these issues in a single package in one meeting or two, this summit will be one more step forward to decreasing the cold war mentality as well as regional instability.  Some political pundits call the Hanoi meeting “make-or-break summit” as they doubt its fruition. However, I believe that the summit will bring US and DPRK closer and create more room for optimism and better relations between the two sides. I emphasize that all the issues will not be finalized in this summit and US President and DPRK’s Chairman have to schedule a next summit for finalization.  Meanwhile, if the issues are too controversial, which may hamper them from reaching a consensus, the two sides have to consider engaging regional stakeholders in the talks. For example, China and Russia played essential role in brokering talks between Seoul and Pyeongyang and can continue their role, if they are demanded, to put their weight behind the talks.  An inclusive negotiation with the participation of regional stakeholders will lead to a more sustainable and trustworthy agreement. Moreover, the international community has to push for an inclusive consensus between the US and ROK on the one side and DPRK on the other side and make sure the agreement is practiced by all sides.

[Photo/Agencies]   It has been confirmed a second summit between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un will take place on Feb 27-28 in Hanoi, Vietnam.  Congratulations to both parties for taking another step toward ending one of the world's most dangerous standoffs and the ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  If the pending summit does end up sustaining the reportedly productive momentum of the preparatory negotiations, it will be remembered for laying solid groundwork for the critical next steps needed for the denuclearization process.  There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense. Which is no doubt why the two parties seem to be diligently working together to present something truly deliverable.  Trump, though he tends to on most things, sounds very optimistic about the upcoming meeting. ""North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse … a different kind of Rocket — an Economic one!"" he tweeted. The change-of-tone twist on an earlier tongue-in-cheek remark suggesting the two sides are at least talking cordially and respectfully to one another.  But while the DPRK economy may indeed take off, it is unlikely to do so without a complete thaw in US-DPRK relations. Only then will Pyongyang be able to concentrate on developing the national economy, without having to worry about external security threats. And such a thaw is unlikely to materialize unless the current state of war is formally put to an end and the shadow of nuclear threats are removed. On these will hinge what Trump and Kim can deliver in Hanoi.  Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for the DPRK, made an important point the other day on his return from ""productive"" preparatory talks in Pyongyang, ""We have some hard work to do with the DPRK between now and then."" Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.  And if the ""set of concrete deliverables"" for the second summit he reportedly discussed with DPRK officials did include Trump's readiness to officially conclude the Korean War, then perhaps we should join Trump in being optimistic about the summit, since that would show the White House is indeed committed to transforming US-DPRK ties and building lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.  So let's extend our best wishes that the preparatory negotiations are both smooth and productive, and the Hanoi summit proves a success. For peace and stability in the region some concrete outcomes would certainly be most welcome.         "
"Defense radar plan puts regional stability at risk: China Daily editorial","

[Photo/Agencies]   In another provocative move that may further complicate regional security and even spark a new arms race among major powers, the United States is reportedly mulling a plan to deploy a new stationary radar — the Homeland Defense Radar — in Japan to help reinforce the US system aimed at intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting US territories.   The US already boasts the world's most advanced land-based anti-ballistic missile system, with missiles deployed in Alaska and California to intercept attacks. Yet in the Missile Defense Review released on Jan 17, US President Donald Trump still expressed the intention to reinforce that system, citing threats of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks by Russia, China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The radar deployment is just part of that plan.  Building unrivaled and unmatched military supremacy for the US has been in Trump's mind ever since he came to office. His professed military buildup ambition includes a dramatic increase in US nuclear stockpiles and building a Space Force to turn space into a war-fighting domain like the land, air and sea. His threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty risks undoing all disarmament efforts the world has witnessed over the past decades.   But the claim these moves are in response to military threats to the US is absurd. No country poses any danger to the world's sole superpower, whose military spending is more than that of all other major countries combined.  But hyping up threats from real and imagined adversaries has been a pretext Washington likes to use to seek uncontested military domination in the world. In 2017 it used the threat of missile attacks from the DPRK to install its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system in the Republic of Korea, breaking the existing military balance in the region.   The situation on the Korean Peninsula has improved markedly since last year. A historic summit was held between Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, with both leaders expressing their commitment to denuclearization and ending decades of hostilities.  Since both countries are working for peace on the peninsula, the radar plan seems out of place, it will only do a disservice to the ongoing detente and trust building and may even derail efforts to make the region nuclear free.   History proves that seeking unilateral and absolute security at the cost of the security of other countries will only trigger an arms race, which in return will cause more instability and make the world a more dangerous rather than a safer place. Washington must abandon its Cold War mentality and stop its aggressive moves for the good of peace and stability in the region.         "

          ","                          US President Donald Trump shakes hands with DPRK's leader Kim Jong-un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island Tuesday, June 12, 2018 in Singapore. [photo/IC]   There is no guarantee that the announced second meeting the top leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will produce anything substantive, or live up to either side's – or the rest of the world's – expectations.  But that should not prevent us from accepting the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un as another step forward. At least in the sense of keeping the denuclearization process alive.  Despite worries that the United States president's eagerness for a ""win"" may undermine US strategic interests, it may be essential for opening up a new phase featuring meaningful interaction.  Trump needs something worth boasting about as he is under pressure from the partial government shutdown over the funding for his wall on the border with Mexico and the ""Russian connection"" investigation. But Kim also needs a positive outcome, as the DPRK's economy continues to suffer under United Nations sanctions, which simultaneously constrain his rapid détente with the Republic of Korea.  Considering that shared eagerness, the question then becomes whether, or to what extent, Trump and Kim can break the current stalemate at their coming summit.  That the US president agreed to a second summit following a face-to-face meeting with the DPRK's top denuclearization negotiator Kim Yong-chol should be a signal he at least has an idea about what the next steps will be. A second summit ending without any tangible outcomes will put himself in an even more awkward position.  But for this meeting to be productive, the two parties will have to demonstrate a shared political will to get real about what they promised last time.  Things may easily return to the apparently circular quarrel over what constitutes meaningful moves, or reciprocity. That is precisely what this summit should strive to tackle. Without breaking that endless circle, denuclearization negotiations will go nowhere.  For the summit to be worthwhile, the two leaders must make serious endeavors to bridge the gap between their governments' stances on how denuclearization should proceed. Washington's desire for swift, independently verifiable, irreversible denuclearization has proven unrealistic. Pyongyang's calls for reciprocity remain unanswered.  Since Pyongyang has gone the extra mile to prove its sincerity, Washington must consider beginning to reciprocate.  Since denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula appears increasingly likely to be a phased process, it would do no harm to any party for that process to start with the formal ending of the nominal state of war.  That is a very low-cost way to attain a feat of potentially historic importance.         "
"Beijing's role in peninsula process unvaryingly positive: China Daily editorial","

          ","                      Kim Jong-un spent his 35th birthday in Beijing. It was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader's first trip abroad in 2019, and he is the first foreign leader Chinese President Xi Jinping has received this year.  In an unprecedented break from Kim's previous visits — this was his fourth to China in 10 months — both the DPRK and China confirmed the visit as it took place.  But even before any additional official information has been received, there has been plenty of wondering, guessing and speculating regarding Kim's latest China visit. Not only because United States President Donald Trump just declared his second summit meeting with Kim may materialize soon, but also because the DPRK leader just threatened to pursue a ""new path"" should the US fail to respond to his country's gestures of goodwill. And because the trip coincided with a critical round of China-US trade negotiations in Beijing. No wonder 9 of the 10 questions the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman took on Tuesday were about Kim's visit.  The US president has tweeted occasional complaints about Beijing not being sufficiently efficient in persuading Pyongyang to denuclearize. But even US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Monday that, ""China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea's nuclear capability."" With the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman summing up China's role as always being ""a positive one"".  Considering the traditional closeness between the Chinese and DPRK leaderships, there is nothing unusual if the two parties compare notes and coordinate positions on matters of common concern. Such a visit is in line with Kim's New Year's Day address, which highlighted ""strategic communication and cooperation with socialist countries"". His three past visits to China occurred prior to his first meeting with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, as well as before and after meeting Trump.  But no observation should overlook the DPRK leader's ambition to boost his country's economy. During his March 2018 visit, Kim visited a Chinese Academy of Sciences exhibition of its research achievements; three months later, he visited a Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences innovation center, and the Beijing Municipal Rail Transit Command Center. This time, he reportedly visited an exhibition commemorating the China's 40 years of reform and opening-up, a technology development zone, and a pharmaceutical factory.  Pyongyang has made clear its intent to shift to economic development, also that it needs assistance in various aspects. Beijing, as a next-door neighbor and longstanding friend, which has maneuvered a rags-to-riches transformation with four decades of reform and opening-up, has a lot of valuable experience to offer.

[Photo/Agencies]   For much of last year, both United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un were very enthusiastic about their interaction. Until they started bickering about whose turn it was to make the next move and the peninsula denuclearization process stalled, with the two sides pointing fingers at each other's gamesmanship.  But while speculation is rife that this means the peace process is on its last legs, both Trump and Kim apparently feel that there is still life in it.  Everybody seems to have noticed Kim's threat ""to explore a new path"" should the US pursue ""sanctions and pressure without keeping a promise it made in front of the world,"" in his New Year address. And to be wondering what that ""new path"" might be.  But Kim also declared denuclearization was his ""firm will"", and his country ""would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them"".  For anyone concerned about Pyongyang being the source of a nuclear threat, that should be a consoling message. Plus, Kim again displayed willingness to continue engaging with Washington over the future of the Korean Peninsula.  On the other side of the Pacific in Washington, the US president announced receiving a ""great"" letter from Kim, along with the probability of them meeting again.  ""He'd like to meet, I'd like to meet"", Trump said. ""We'll set that up, we'll be setting that up in the not-too-distant future"".  Although Trump stated he was in no hurry, unless the current momentum is badly disrupted, another US-DPRK summit meeting would likely sustain what Trump has said is his ""very good relationship with North Korea"", which is critical to his claim to have made progress in removing a nuclear threat.  It would also serve Pyongyang's needs for peace, economic development and closer cooperation with Seoul. There would be no guarantee of peace if the DPRK returns to a tense standoff with the US, while constructive engagement on denuclearization might be rewarded with precious US assistance in its pursuit of economic progress.  So it would be no surprise if another Trump-Kim summit occurs sooner rather than later.  However, things cannot really proceed far with key US demands remaining unmet and with the sanctions on the DPRK still in place, and since neither side seems willing to be the one to make the required move first, it would be naive to believe another meeting will make a substantial difference, unless somebody comes up with something new.  Both sides should heed the other's rational concerns if the positive momentum is to be maintained this year.         "
"Sanctions on Iran unlikely to get what White House wants","

          ","                      [Photo/Agencies]   As the US president indicated Saturday, he wants a deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Only he wants ""a new, more comprehensive"" one. One that suffices to not only freeze Iran's nuclear program, but also reduces that country's influence across the Middle East.  He seems confident that the full reinstatement of sanctions on Monday will achieve that, or he would not have posted a Game of Thrones-inspired poster, featuring himself, in the now-familiar chin-up determined-look pose, declaring ""sanctions are coming"".  That trademark confidence of his positive thinking has no doubt been bolstered by the success of pressuring Mexico and Canada into renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and transforming it into what is now the more White House acceptable United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  And particularly the outcome of the ""extreme pressure"" exerted on the Democratic Republic of Korea, which his administration seemingly expects will work similar magic on Teheran.  Yet Washington would be seriously miscalculating if it assumes the kind of deal it seeks will materialize easily. It is certainly not just because Teheran will not back off. Iran is a lot different from the DPRK, thanks to its greater capabilities, resources and influence in the region.  Despite Trump's animosity to the 2015 agreement, which he called ""defective at its core"", whose ""decaying and rotten structure""""cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb"", all the other signatories find it desirable and want to safeguard it.  China and Russia are firmly for it. And France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union have issued a joint statement, announcing they ""deeply regret"" Trump's decision, reiterating their continued commitment to the deal.  In spite of Washington's allegation that Teheran is violating the agreement, United Nations inspectors stand firmly by their conclusion that it is abiding by the agreement.  The conspicuous lack of international solidarity on this issue, combined with the moral weakness of the US argument, will no doubt undermine its ""extreme pressure"" tactic.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has demanded Teheran to withdraw from Syria, end its support to Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Huthi rebels in Yemen. Such demands have nothing to do with a nuclear agreement.  The world was united behind sanctions against Iran in 2012. But the Trump administration is trying to get others to help it get what it wants. Having made clear it is only acting in its own interests it is hypocritical to call on others to do the same.         "

[Photo/IC]   Unimaginable just a few months ago, Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un may soon shake hands with his US counterpart at a second summit meeting.  Kim has on multiple occasions expressed readiness to forsake nuclear weapons, for which he had turned his back on the rest of the world. Now he is offering to allow international inspectors to verify the measures he has taken.He has also reportedly entrusted Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in to convey an invitation for Pope Francis to visit his country.  And his government has officially launched a website dedicated to soliciting investments in selected development projects, ranging from hotels to railways to power stations.  These are unmistakable gestures of goodwill, indicating genuine eagerness on his part for his country to rejoin the international community and pursue nation-building in a peaceful environment.  Moon, who has been behind most of those recent developments and has engaged personally with his northern counterpart, says he is convinced of Kim's sincerity, and is now calling on the rest of the world to reward Kim for what he has done.  If, as he told Le Figaro, Kim ""has taken the strategic decision to abandon his nuclear weapons"", this is indeed time for the international community, the United States in particular, to respond accordingly.  Given the initial steps Pyongyang has taken and pledged to take, it is important for the rest of the world to not keep Kim from feeling ""frustrated by the international community's continuing mistrust"".  Moon was correct in saying that ""we need to assure Kim Jong-un that he took the right decision in deciding to denuclearize and we need to accompany him in his wish for a durable and solid peace"".  This may not be easy. But the international community does need to prove its appreciation of the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula, and offer decent incentive for sustaining the fine momentum.  Moon's call for an official end to the Korean War reflects Pyongyang's foremost concern is for security guarantees in exchange for denuclearizing. Which is understandable considering the longstanding insecurity the DPRK has been made to feel by the US and its allies. Without this concern being properly addressed, all rhetoric about denuclearization may just be empty talk.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   Absent the widely anticipated agreement on a second summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's fourth trip to Pyongyang did not produce the widely expected outcome.  Yet let's not call the visit fruitless.  Considering the top US diplomat did not even meet with Kim Jong-un on his last visit, and he and Kim talked for two hours this time, with the latter promising to continue working toward denuclearization, it was as said ""better than last time"".  Both Pyongyang and Washington have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of progress made since US President Donald Trump and Kim met in Singapore in June, and they have both questioned the other's sincerity. While Washington has insisted Pyongyang has not done enough to denuclearize, the latter has argued it needed to see the former reciprocate.  Pyongyang having dismantled a nuclear test site and then missile facilities, agreeing to a peace treaty to end the 1950-53 war, which concluded with armistice, would have cost nearly nothing on Washington's part and been a reciprocal sign of good faith, especially given Pyongyang had earlier offered to dismantle another nuclear site.  With a peace treaty seemingly not yet forthcoming, that Pyongyang and Washington have reaffirmed their shared willingness to sustain their detente is in itself surely something worth celebrating. With all that has happened, or not happened, a common resolve to keep things moving forward toward amicable relations and denuclearization of the peninsula is surely precious.           "

          ","                                                 ROK President Moon Jae-in and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un shake hands after signing documents during the inter-Korean summit at the Paekhwawon State Guesthouse in Pyongyang, in this still frame taken from video Sept 19, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The optics was fine and the sound bites heartening.  Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in delivered exactly what they were expected to.  They announced a key document on eliminating mutual military threat, a substantial follow-up to the historic April 27 joint declaration vowing to stop all kinds of hostile acts.  They proposed to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games.  And they reached an agreement on Kim visiting the ROK, along with other measures to broaden and deepen constructive engagement.  The most significant part of Wednesday's joint declaration to other stakeholders, though, is its Article V, which vows to ""turn the Peninsula into a land of peace free of nuclear weapons and nuclear threats, and for that purpose make substantial progress as soon as possible"".  To substantiate Pyongyang's sincerity, the document does go one step further, offering to ""permanently deactivate and abandon"" another key engine test and missile launcher facility. Aside from that unilateral, unconditional offer, it also highlights ""additional measures"" like permanently discarding nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, on condition that Washington ""takes corresponding measures"".  The third Kim-Moon summit was more like a bifurcation than a turning point. Although US President Donald Trump has welcomed the development and indicated negotiations with Pyongyang may get back on track, anything can happen moving forward.  But the Kim-Moon summit in Pyongyang did indicate one thing: inter-Korean rapport may develop faster, with the denuclearization process moving in tandem but on a slower track. Not that thawing Pyongyang-Seoul ties does not help denuclearization. They are a precondition for the latter. Yet they do not suffice for the latter to materialize.  Clause II, Article V of the Pyongyang joint declaration reiterates the DPRK's already clear position that the ball is now in the US' court, and the prospect of denuclearization is contingent on the latter's response.  If Washington insists suspending some high-profile exercises alone is a qualified response and show of goodwill, substantial progress may be difficult to achieve for the time being.  Although the new joint declaration does not clarify what constitutes ""corresponding measures"", it does hint at something better. In earlier appeals to Washington, Pyongyang had asked for formal termination of the Korean War, the state of war to be more precise.  Considering the symbolic nature of the lingering state of war on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the substantial moves Pyongyang is to make in return, Washington ought to give it a serious thought.  In the mean time, Seoul may want to push both parties harder to achieve greater progress on denuclearization, because inter-Korean rapport cannot go too far without addressing such a broader international concern.

          ","                          ROK President Moon Jae-in, right, meets with top leader of the DPRK Kim Jong-un in the border village of Panmunjom on April, 27, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The third summit between the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea is another sign that, despite the apparent diplomatic standstill between Pyongyang and Washington, things remain on track between the Koreas.  As long as this momentum is maintained, hopes for broader detente on the Korean Peninsula will remain high. And if this is the yardstick for assessing the third summit between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, there is little reason for it to not succeed.  Since DPRK leader Kim Jong-un and ROK President Moon Jae-in signed the Panmunjom Joint Declaration on April 27, relations between the Koreas have proceeded generally smoothly according to that script. Moon's ongoing visit to Pyongyang, like his meeting with Kim, is also part of that historic agreement.  Article II of the Joint Declaration vows to ease military tensions and eliminate risks of war through joint efforts, and by agreeing to cease ""all kinds of hostile acts"" on land, sea, and in the air. Carrying this spirit forward, Moon said on Thursday that ""bringing an end"" to accidental skirmishes and lingering tensions is his top priority.  Pyongyang is equally eager for closer engagement with Seoul, and stated in its earlier message to Washington that it wants an official end to the Korean War in exchange for moving further toward denuclearization.  And through their reportedly 17-hour-long talks on Thursday, meant to pave way for the summit, the two sides' militaries ""confirmed each other's positions on what should be included in the agreement and adjusted the wording concerning the relevant document"", the ROK Defense Ministry said.  But while the two Koreas have maintained the momentum set at their historic summit in April, permanent peace cannot be restored on the peninsula without the involvement of the United States, which suddenly called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday to deal with what it claimed are efforts by some countries to ""undermine and obstruct"" the sanctions against the DPRK.  The US calling an emergency Security Council meeting on the eve of the Kim-Moon summit cannot be a mere coincidence. However, the Kim-Moon summit, if it takes the peace agenda forward, could offset the impact of any adverse outcome of the UN Security Council meeting.  But lasting peace goes far beyond any inter-Korean arrangement. It includes, among others things, a breakthrough in denuclearization. And Moon will likely propose a compromise solution to denuclearization at his meeting with Kim, which could become a turning point in the Korean Peninsula peace process. However, it will succeed only if the US formally embraces it.         "

Even better when it comes with a timeline.  Both happened on Wednesday, when an envoy of Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in met with Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Such a dramatic turnaround will surely rekindle hopes after the United States president canceled a planned visit by his secretary of state to Pyongyang citing lack of progress.  That move by Donald Trump, along with his complaint about Beijing allegedly being less cooperative, significantly dented the optimism that had followed his meeting with Kim in Singapore.  But with ""practical measures"" toward denuclearization reportedly on the agenda for the meeting between Kim and Moon due to take place in Pyongyang on Sept 18-20, and Moon's envoy reportedly relaying messages between Trump and Kim, there are grounds for renewed optimism.  After all, people have generally anticipated the opposite following Trump's decision, to which Pyongyang had responded with anger.  Yet this in no way means denuclearization will be a smooth and rapid process. Pyongyang's latest promise, like its previous moves to nullify a nuclear test ground and dismantle missile launchers, is not unconditional.  Reportedly frustrated over ""doubt shown by some parts of the international society about his will"", this is the DPRK leader's latest message that he is serious about denuclearization. But Kim has again indicated he is waiting for his ""good faith"" to be ""accepted with good faith"". According the ROK envoy, he is ready to roll out ""more active measures"" toward denuclearization when he sees ""reciprocation"".  While Washington insists suspending the US-ROK joint military exercises qualifies as reciprocation. Pyongyang wants an official end to the 1951-53 Korean War.  Given this, what happens next is more likely to be continuing bargaining over who is to give what, and when, rather than any concrete actions.  In order for the parties' rhetoric about reciprocation and denuclearization to deliver outcomes in the real world, Seoul, in its middleman's role, has a lot to do to first bridge the conspicuous perception and expectation gaps between Pyongyang and Washington.  The outcomes of the latest exchange of messages between Trump and Kim, and whether they lead to any new developments ahead of the inter-Korean summit will likely indicate whether Kim's timeline of denuclearization within this presidential term is realizable.

[Photo/Agencies]   Frustrated there has been no tangible progress on denuclearization, the Donald Trump administration has just reached a fresh consensus with Japan and the Republic of Korea on sustaining the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, until the latter gives up nuclear weapons.  Even amid the ostensible detente following the June 12 Singapore meeting between Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, there was no mention of discontinuing what Trump described as a ""maximum pressure"" tactic. But what US State Secretary Mike Pompeo reiterated in his latest phone conversations with his Japanese and ROK counterparts is a clear indication of the White House's belated recognition that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula is not as simple as it once believed.  Trump entered into personal engagement with his counterpart in Pyongyang assuming his predecessors were all inferior; he, on the other hand, had a magic wand. It is good that the US president has finally come to terms with the reality, and he has conceded that the matter is complicated, something that will be more conducive to him making informed decisions about how the denuclearization process is to be approached.  By now Trump should be aware denuclearization will not happen overnight, at least not the way he anticipated. His predecessors were not as ""foolish"" as he portrayed them to be. Indeed, the likelihood is high that he may find himself returning to the same path they followed and end up in a similar position.  Because after all, like all his predecessors found out, nuclear weapons are the sole and ultimate bargaining chip Pyongyang has, meaning it will not forsake them without getting what it wants. In return for abandoning its nuclear arsenal, Pyongyang seeks a cast iron security guarantee, economic assistance and probably a lot more. And with that in mind, Pyongyang naturally expects the process to be one of give-and-take.  After nullifying a nuclear test ground, some missile launchers and returning the remains of wartime US service people, Pyongyang is now awaiting something concrete in return.  It should come as no surprise, therefore, if Pyongyang condemns the latest US-Japan-ROK agreement as proof of the insincerity in which the US is conducting the denuclearization negotiations.

[Photo/VCG]   United States President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that his secretary of state is postponing a planned visit to Pyongyang until the “trading relationship with China is resolved”. Considering the lack of progress in China-US trade talks, that could be quite a while.  It is one thing to say a trade war with China is distracting, it is another thing to blame Beijing for the less than fruitful progress in negotiations between the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  Beijing has retorted angrily to Trump making such an accusation, stating it is continuing to help with the process of denuclearization as it was. Denouncing it as irresponsible, the Chinese foreign ministry said it was “seriously concerned” by Trump's ""capricious"" accusations and said it has lodged an official diplomatic complaint over the comments.  Indeed, Trump's tweet goes against the basic truth that it would be to Beijing’s own detriment should it slacken its efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is not only conducive to the DPRK’s own aspirations for prosperity, but would offer China long-term security dividends. For its own benefit, Beijing’s commitment to denuclearization is not just rhetorical.  That being said, Beijing is correct on insisting that Korean Peninsula issues are mostly the contradictions between the US and the DPRK, which will not be resolved without Washington and Pyongyang straightening out their longstanding differences.  Beijing can hardly help with Washington and Pyongyang being unable to even agree on where to start when it comes to denuclearization.  Trump based his belief that Beijing is not helping with the process of denuclearization as it was because ""of our much tougher trading stance with China"".  And the present state of China-US trade interactions does warrant concerns over both parties’ capabilities to manage their dispute, so as to prevent it from jeopardizing the overall relationship.  Beijing, for its part, is trying hard to contain any spillover, but clearly Trump, facing growing difficulties at home with the midterm elections looming, is looking to unfairly portray China as the cause of all the problems that are of his administration's own making.  Instead of trying to lay the blame for the lack of progress in denuclearization at Beijing's door, the Trump administration should show greater sincerity and flexibility and prove it is acting in good faith by responding to Pyongyang's displays of earnestness with concrete actions of its own.

[Photo/Agencies]   On Saturday, United States President Donald Trump called on ""all of the fools"" focusing on Russia to ""start also looking in another direction, China"".  On Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton told ABC's This Week that he could say ""definitively"" there is a ""national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling, and North Korean meddling"" in the 2018 midterm elections.  This can't be coincidence. Quite likely it is a clumsy attempt by the White House to distract public attention from Robert Mueller's unyielding probe into ties between Trump's campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 US general elections.   It should go without saying that the claims of Chinese meddling are ridiculous; they had never been heard before Sunday. It will certainly be mission impossible to substantiate the latest allegations as judging from what Bolton said - and did not say - he was not talking about anything taking place in the real world, but something the paranoid White House has imagined.   If Bolton's allegation was meant to lend support to Trump's, it didn't. Because the logic here is inherently problematic: while Trump was trying to discredit an investigation into something that is supposed to have occurred, Bolton pointed his finger at something he, or perhaps the entire White House, worries may, or may not, happen.   But the Trump-Bolton double act over the weekend should not be dismissed as a comedy duo saying little of significance. For at the very least it offers fresh evidence that the unfolding trade war is only one aspect of the troubled China-US relationship.   The klutzy attempt at misdirection exploits the growing ""red-under-the bed"" anti-China sentiment that is being whipped up in the US by an increasingly bullish and beleaguered administration. The White House is trying to use China as a political foil to serve its political agenda.  With the US intent on portraying everything China does in a negative light, there is no point in trying to appease it.   The abuse and menace toward China now emanating from the White House, should prompt Beijing to reconsider its approach. With Beijing increasingly being viewed as a strategic adversary, the latter must recalibrate its long-standing US policies, which have placed overwhelming weight on engagement by expanding common ground.   Meanwhile, the White House should be cautious that its bullyragging does not lead it by the nose.

The third inter-Korean summit in a little more than five months is a sign of the continuing rapprochement across the 38th Parallel, and it is expected to make substantial headway toward officially ending the Korean War, which concluded with an armistice in 1953, leaving the two Koreas technically at war.  But that is no insurance the seeds Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in have sown together will grow into big trees, as Ri Son-gwon, the DPRK's chief delegate, wishes. Let alone a formal peace treaty, since even substantial further engagement between Pyongyang and Seoul may prove unrealistic without wholehearted endorsement by the United States, a key party in that war.  The present state of relations between Washington and Pyongyang, however, does not seem to support substantial progress in that direction. Despite the initial optimism following the high-profile meeting between US President Donald Trump and the DPRK leader in Singapore, the international community is yet to see any meaningful result, except for occasional rhetoric about hopes.  More recently, as that wave of enthusiasm ebbs, the two parties appear to have reverted to their decades-old blame game. While Pyongyang accuses Washington of a lack of sincerity and taking a ""gangster-like"" approach with its sanctions, the latter shows no intention of easing its stance of ""maximum pressure"".  President Moon has been praised for initiating and then salvaging the once impossible summit meeting between Trump and Kim. It will entail similar diplomatic skills for him to keep the two parties engaged in meaningful dialogue, and ensure that engagement produces tangible movement toward denuclearization.  Pyongyang demolished a nuclear test site and then a missile launch facility. But those constructive gestures have been lost amid the recent suspicions that it is resuming nuclear activities. Washington, on its part, while wanting Pyongyang to make more convincing moves to denuclearize, has offered little in the way of incentives for it to do so. Should this pattern persist, things very likely will return to how they were.  Moon's mediation efforts will not succeed unless he finds a way to bridge the expectations gap.         "

[Photo/VCG]   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wound up a three-day visit to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on the weekend. The first high-level contact between the United States and the DPRK in the wake of the historic meeting between their two leaders signals the two sides’ continuing efforts to resolve their differences and promote the denuclearization process.  Since US President Donald Trump and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un’s summit in Singapore on June 12, there have been high expectations worldwide that the Korean Peninsula issues will be resolved once and for all. However, given the complexity of the situation, there is still a long way to go before that wish can be realized.  That Washington and Pyongyang have aired different views on the outcome of Pompeo’s visit is clear proof that the two sides still need more consultations and clarifications so that they, along with other stakeholders in the issue, can dispel mistrust and design a roadmap leading for peace and denuclearization on the peninsula.  Although Pompeo described the high-level negotiations as “productive” and insisted progress was made, the DPRK called the high-level talks “regrettable” and slammed the US demands as reflecting a “gangster-like mindset” in a statement. Fortunately, Pyongyang said it still trusts Trump, which is significant for sustaining the current good momentum.  During the Trump-Kim meeting, Washington and Pyongyang reached important agreements on principle issues. But it would be naïve to think the enmity and distrust built up over decades would simply disappear overnight.  While hammering out the details of a roadmap for denuclearization and peace, it is essential that the two sides continue high-level consultations and build greater mutual trust so that they heed each other’s major concerns. It may be, as suggested, the two countries have different understandings of denuclearization. If this is the case, it proves the necessity of continuous engagement and trust building. That the two sides have reportedly agreed to form working groups to oversee their interactions will hopefully be conducive to this.  Meanwhile, major stakeholders in the peninsula issue also need extensive communication so as to build a broader consensus among them. After all, there should be no turning back the historic momentum on the peninsula as it conforms to the common aspirations of the international community for denuclearization and peace.         "

SHEN HONG / XINHUA   Since the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea first began showing its commitment to improving relations with the Republic of Korea earlier this year, Beijing has thrown its weight behind Pyongyang’s efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and seek reconciliation with Seoul and Washington.  The third visit to China in less than three months by Kim Jong-un, top leader of the DPRK, is clear proof of the revitalized friendship between the two neighbors and the close communication between Kim and President Xi Jinping. It also underscores the coordination of Beijing and Pyongyang as they look to bolster the positive outcomes of Kim’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12.  With the easing of situation on the Korean Peninsula having been effectively strengthened by the implementation of the consensus reached between Beijing and Pyongyang and the meeting between Kim and Trump in Singapore, maintaining the current desirable momentum was naturally high on the agenda for the latest talks between Xi and Kim.  Kim’s two-day visit on Tuesday and Wednesday has once again highlighted the crucial role China has been playing as a mediator between the DPRK and the US, as well as the stake it has in regional stability and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Looking forward, though, more still needs to be done to establish a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, and this requires all the parties involved to not only demonstrate political wisdom but also patience. The good relationship and communication Xi has with both Kim and Trump will hopefully be beneficial in this regard, by helping to ensure that Pyongyang and Washington remain on the same page.  Cooperative relations between China and the DPRK have radiated new vitality with their strengthened high-level communication. Kim’s latest talks with Xi will have reassured him that China stands behind the DPRK as it switches its focus to economic development. Something that is clearly a priority for Kim, as he visited an agricultural technology park and rail traffic control center in Beijing on Wednesday.  The consolidation of the friendship between the two countries promises to be beneficial not only to themselves, but also the region. For if the joint efforts of the two longtime friends are reinforced by those of other stakeholders, the prospects for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and regional stability will be greater than they have ever been over the past more than 60 years.

[Photo/Xinhua, The Straits Times]   It remains to be seen if it was the defining moment in history it was being billed as. Nevertheless, the smooth proceeding of the first ever face-to-face talks between the sitting leaders of the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has yielded positive results.  While it was hard to reconcile nuclear Armageddon with the images of US President Donald Trump and the top leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un shaking hands, having a friendly chat and sitting down to lunch, that has been the concern of the international community, given the hostilities that has festered over the past more than six decades.  The summit therefore marked a significant step forward in meeting expectations for an end to the animosity between the two countries, and for concerted efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and find solutions to the attendant issues.  As China’s Foreign Ministry said, the meeting was a correct and important step. It should not be forgotten how unlikely such a summit was just six months ago. Nor how much effort it took on the part of many to overcome what Kim called the “old prejudices and practices” to make it happen. China has been unswerving in its efforts to facilitate the talks.  Now the commitments that were announced in Singapore need to be delivered on so that the momentum that has built up steam since the beginning of the year can become sustainable and irreversible.  While appreciating the political resolve shown by Kim and Trump, China has urged further dialogue and the continued efforts of all the parties concerned to push forward the peace process and denuclearization.  And it will continue to play its part in seeking to achieve these goals, by firmly supporting the two countries realizing the consensus reached by Kim and Trump in Singapore and providing its continued support to consolidate and expand that consensus.  Since the crux of the Korean nuclear issue is the DPRK’s sense of security, Trump’s promise of unique security guarantees has removed one of the obstacles to a peace agreement, and ultimately the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  While no one should expect the summit to have ironed out all the differences and erased the deep-seated mistrust between the two long-time foes, it has ignited hopes that they will be finally able to put an end to their hostility and that the long-standing peninsula issues can finally be resolved. These hopes should not be extinguished.         "

The denouement to months of diplomatic efforts and the on-off-on-again saga that unfolded after its announcement, the meeting is of great significance. The first between the incumbent leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it is a face-to-face conversation that can set the course of history - for better or worse. Such a meeting seemed impossible less than a year ago, when Trump and Kim were exchanging fiery rhetoric and trading personal insults. Indeed, to many it seemed that conflict was imminent. And even after olive branches were extended and accepted and the meeting agreed, there were still twists in the plot. When the DPRK denounced the US-ROK joint military drills in May and suspended pre-arranged high-level talks with the Republic of Korea because of the drills, many began to doubt whether the summit would go ahead. And their rendezvous seemed to be an increasingly remote possibility with both Trump and Kim threatening to call it off. However, in the hours and minutes between then and now, hasty judgments and words were rescinded. And so it has come to pass that they meet today. China has undoubtedly contributed much to materializing the meeting. It has long called for such direct talks, and it has worked hard as an intermediary to materialize them. It sincerely hopes that Kim and Trump will be able to make breakthroughs when they meet so that the two countries can begin taking steps toward the signing of a belated peace treaty to bring a formal end to the Korean War. And there's the thing, even if there is no immediate substantial outcome from the talks, the Singapore summit can serve as the necessary beginning for achieving this, as it can make it possible for the US and the DPRK to continue their communication to secure their final rapprochement and thus the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Both parties have long considered the other to be an enemy, and it has been a long journey to reach this point. Now Trump and Kim should do their utmost to agree on their next step so as to maintain the positive momentum. This would not only reward all those who have spared no efforts in their attempts to make their meeting a reality, it would also enable both to hail it as a success. Certainly, the world expects them to do nothing less.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   The summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un may or may not be taking place on June 12 as planned.  Trump informed Kim in a letter on Thursday that he was canceling the meeting because of the DPRK's recent ""hostility"".  ""Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,"" Trump wrote in his letter, which was released by the White House.  The anger shown by the DPRK that Trump cited as the reason for the meeting being called off is understandable. The DPRK called US Vice-President Mike Pence ""ignorant and stupid"" after he said the country could ""end like Libya"". The second time Pyongyang was threatened with this fate ahead of the meeting after Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton also spoke of that possibility.  Since the Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi was killed by US-backed rebels eight years after he gave up his nuclear weapons program, such comments are bound to spook Pyongyang, as no doubt intended.  Trump also spoke of the United States' ""massive and powerful"" nuclear capabilities in his letter, saying he hoped they would never ""have to be used"". All of which has served to highlight the existential threat that prompted Pyongyang to pursue nuclear weapons in the first place. A threat that has been ratcheted up despite Trump saying on Tuesday that ""He (Kim) will be safe. He will be happy. His country will be rich"".  With its cheeky invitation for Kim to ""call or write"" to set up a meeting, the letter did not slam the door shut on talks. Something he stressed later saying it required ""concrete steps"" from the DPRK. It is worth bearing in mind that despite the letter's grandstanding, Trump said on Tuesday, in a meet-the-media with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, that they were working on something with the DPRK. Something that might not work out for June 12, but ""that doesn't mean it won't work out over a period of time"".  An end to hostilities and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are the goals that many countries have been working for in the past decades. Which is true of China, whatever, Trump might suggest to the contrary. It has urged the DPRK and the US to hold firm their commitment to dialogue in order to move relations forward.  After 65 years some maneuvering is to be expected, but all parties need to keep in contact and work toward the same goals.         "

          ","                          President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un are planned to meet on June 12, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in said in Washington on Tuesday that ""the fate and the future"" of the Korean Peninsula hinges on US President Donald Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Certainly, a first ever face-to-face meeting between the incumbent leaders of the two countries would present a historic opportunity to finally end the standoff and tensions that have persisted for more than six decades.  Which is why talk from both sides that the meeting might not go ahead as planned has raised concerns.  Trump has said there is a ""substantial chance"" the summit won't happen as scheduled — saying it could be delayed or canceled if ""certain conditions"" are not met. And the DPRK has threatened to scrap the meeting after Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton said there could be a ""Libya-style solution"" to denuclearize the DPRK, something that did not end well for the Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi.  Given past practices, it is possible that both parties are just jockeying for position ahead of the talks. But it is to be hoped neither side puts a foot wrong in doing so.  The mutual suspicions that have festered over the years will not be dispelled in just a few months. And the history of agreements breaking down because of the lack of trust, means that the two sides' demands and expectations have to be realistic.  Trump said on Tuesday that he believes Kim is serious about denuclearization, and that in the short period of time his administration has been engaging with Pyongyang it has been a relationship that seems to be working. But he added, it remains to be seen how long it continues to work. For it to do so, Washington will need to deliver on its promises of security guarantees for Pyongyang, as this is fundamental to any progress.  With the US seemingly wanting swift denuclearization in one go, and the DPRK wanting it in phases, there is certainly the possibility there will be no meeting of ways.  But with Trump saying the two sides are still talking, and Pyongyang allowing reporters entry to cover the dismantling of the nuclear test site, the two sides clearly believe it is still on the cards.  All stakeholders have every reason to do all they can to ensure the meeting does go ahead, as it is a necessary step toward securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and finally laying this legacy of the Cold War to rest.

          ","                      The easing of tensions that has completely changed the picture on the Korean Peninsula has been hard won. It should not be taken for granted. The good progress that has been made in getting the two sides talking has necessitated a softening of their previously bellicose stances. However, the rapport that has been forged is extremely vulnerable given the mistrust and suspicion that has festered over the years. Yet this is a historic moment when the antagonism and mistrust fomented during the Cold War may finally be laid to rest. The possibility of direct talks between the leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States — the first since the armistice agreement put an end to hostilities 65 years ago — should be cherished, not squandered. Which is exactly what the US-ROK joint military exercises that began on Friday have risked doing. The drills are an annual event and no doubt require a degree of coordination and planning, but given the significance of the coming meeting between DPRK leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, they could surely have been canceled or postponed. In response, Pyongyang canceled high-level talks with Seoul hours before they were due to take place on Wednesday. It was entirely predictable that it would do so, given how much it dislikes the provocative military maneuvers that simulate attacks on it, and its past responses to them. These developments have poured cold water on the warming relations that were on display at the summit between Kim and his counterpart Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea on April 27, when the two Koreas agreed to complete denuclearization of the peninsula and the replacement of the current armistice agreement with a peace treaty. What is even more disturbing is Pyongyang’s statement immediately after that Kim may cancel his meeting with Trump if the US pressures Pyongyang to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons. It is all very well for the White House to say it is carrying on with preparations for the Singapore summit on June 12, as that makes it look like it is Pyongyang that is spoiling the party. However, unless Washington shows it is sincere about finally putting an end to the acrimony and animosity, the concerted efforts to nurture the precious potential for peace since the beginning of the year will not be rewarded. Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang need to treasure what has been achieved, increase their communication, and try to overcome the mistrust and suspicions that stand in the way of a historic breakthrough.

[Photo/Agencies]   Everything appears to be rosy ahead of the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un.  Trump expressed his personal appreciation to Kim after three US citizens who had been detained by Pyongyang for anti-state activities were released on Wednesday. The DPRK’s official news agency, KCNA, reported that Kim had decided to grant amnesty to the three Americans at the “suggestion” of the US president.  The move came just hours after the government leaders of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea expressed their shared commitment to preserving and promoting the positive momentum on the Korean Peninsula at their long-postponed tripartite summit meeting in Tokyo. And it has been a while since they all agreed on something.  And it came the day after Kim made his second visit to China to meet with President Xi Jinping, just 40 days after his first visit, which was also his first trip outside his country since he became leader. During their cordial conversations in the northeastern coastal city of Dalian, Kim reiterated his willingness to denuclearize and his hopes that the upcoming summit with Trump would lead to lasting peace for his country and the Korean Peninsula.  History has hardly seen such broad-based support for substantive headway to be made in resolving the Korean Peninsula situation. With all the direct stakeholders enthusiastically engaged, it is becoming seemingly more possible by the day that the “historic meeting” Kim anticipates will produce what Trump hopes will be a “very successful deal”.  But it is that very desire that may prevent it from being realized. Anyone anticipating that “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” can be obtained with just a snap of the fingers, is probably destined to be disappointed.  That Pyongyang is actively promoting rapprochement, and has openly embraced the idea of ultimate denuclearization is indeed a very encouraging development. And, considering the shared interest in a negotiated outcome for the protracted crisis, the region may be closer than ever to untying what has long been a Gordian knot.  However, let us not ignore Kim’s statement that a successful summit with the US president will only be “a fine first step toward building a fine future”.  And given Washington’s apparent eagerness for immediate outcomes and Pyongyang’s preference for things to proceed in a step-by-step manner, a lot still needs to be straightened out in order to bridge what could be an unsurmountable gap.  Given the role it has been playing in facilitating the progress that has been achieved so far, Beijing can play a more active role in this respect by promoting a convergence of pragmatic expectations for the upcoming meeting.

[Photo/Xinhua]   There is no reason to doubt the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s sincerity in wanting to put an end to the long-standing hostility that has made it feel continually threatened. That enmity really should have been consigned to history a long time ago. However, past detentes were aborted due to perceptions on both sides that commitments were not being honored.  That should serve as a lesson that dedicated efforts are needed to remove mutual suspicions. And that for the current positive momentum to have the necessary firm foundations on which to build lasting peace, greater trust is crucial.  By meeting the need for an honest broker to help instill confidence that each side is acting in good faith, China has been playing and continues to play an indispensable role in the Korean Peninsula peace process.  Certainly the DPRK is not going to denuclearize unless it is convinced it has cast-iron and workable security guarantees. Nor are the United States and the Republic of Korea going to give such guarantees unless they are convinced that denuclearization is indeed taking place. Which will be a chicken and egg standoff, unless each side is satisfied the other will honor its step-by-step commitments.  China has been working hard to ensure the momentum that has been realized is consolidated. And that both sides sincerely cherish the possibility of putting their animosity behind them.  In the latest move, President Xi Jinping met with DPRK leader Kim Jong-un in the northeastern Chinese coastal city of Dalian on Tuesday. The DPRK’s state news agency KCNA said the meeting added important momentum to bilateral ties at a crucial time.  The two leaders’ meeting was unexpected as it came just 40 days after Kim had met with Xi in Beijing. But it comes ahead of Kim’s planned meeting with US President Donald Trump, which is expected to take place sometime this month, or next.  The friendly get-together enabled Kim to assure Xi that his country remains committed to denuclearization and has no need to possess nuclear weapons if there is an end to the hostile policies and security threats against it.  A message that Xi will no doubt pass on to US President Donald Trump, who later tweeted that he hopes he “will speak to my friend President Xi” by telephone on Tuesday evening, Beijing time, to discuss the DPRK situation and trade.  With Xi reaffirming to Kim that China will support the DPRK in its economic construction efforts now that it is switching its focus to development, the meeting marks another significant step forward for the Korean Peninsula peace process.

[Photo/VCG]   In a historic step — literally — Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un walked into the Republic of Korea and met with ROK President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom truce village. The fact that Kim became the first DPRK leader to set foot on ROK soil since the armistice in the Korean War in 1953 will be etched in history irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the historical meeting between the two leaders.  The two sides had high expectations from the third inter-Korean summit and the first since 2007. And fittingly, the firm handshake between Kim and Moon, accompanied by the smiles on their faces, indicated “a new beginning of history”, as the DPRK leader called it later.  By pledging to work for the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, the two leaders laid to rest any doubts that the summit would fail to yield the desired results. The joint declaration pledged to restore peace on the peninsula by, among other things, pursuing phased arms reduction, ceasing hostile acts, transforming the fortified border into a peace zone, and seeking multilateral talks.  In fact, the joint declaration said: “The two leaders declare before our people of 80 million and the entire world there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and a new age of peace has begun.”  Equally important, the two leaders said they would work with China and the United States to “officially end” the Korean War this year and seek an agreement to establish “permanent” peace in its place.  Washington, in turn, said it is hopeful the Pyongyang-Seoul talks will succeed in restoring peace and prosperity for the two sides, and is preparing for the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim in a few weeks.  The consensus on denuclearization, if properly implemented, will not only end the hostilities between the two sides, but also usher in a new era of development on the peninsula.  It would be in the interest of all parties, therefore, to keep the positive momentum going, so that no untoward incident prevents permanent peace and prosperity from being restored not only on the peninsula but also in the region and beyond.

[Photo/VCG]   The surprise announcement that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is suspending its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missiles tests is an auspicious prelude to leader Kim Jong-un's upcoming summit with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, and his planned talks with United States President Donald Trump.  Now there seems to be no reason why the two meetings should not go ahead and Pyongyang rewarded for its show of goodwill.  This may seem a step too far. But Kim was not acting on a whim. The decision came with a change in the country's national strategy. The focus is now on the economy.  A DPRK that is preoccupied with providing better lives for its people and proactively engaged in communication with neighboring countries and the broader international community will be a blessing to the region and the world at large. Both China and Russia have welcomed the announcement and urged the ROK and the US to act accordingly to promote a peaceful settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.  It is important to keep in mind this is a move awaiting a positive response. For what is intended to be kick-started by the talks will be a protracted process that could easily go awry.  Certainly skeptical observers have been quick to point out that suspending its weapons tests is not the same as renouncing them, and that it is not because his country is ready to abandon nuclear weapons that Kim has announced the suspension. Instead, those tests are no longer necessary since Pyongyang already has nuclear weapons, and it is believed the ""northern test site"" is no longer operable anyway.  So what Kim presented was perhaps more of an overture than anything substantial. While striking a conciliatory tone, Kim's pledges of no first use and no proliferation of nuclear weapons, also conveyed the message that Kim will sit down for talks as the leader of a legitimate nuclear power. Negotiations about actual nuclear disarmament will likely prove arduous given such weapons are critical to Pyongyang's sense of security. It will require ironclad security guarantees if it is to relinquish them.  Yet the DPRK's move does offer an opportunity to discuss a political settlement of the peninsula issue in his talks with first Moon, then Trump.  Trump tweeted: ""This is very good news for North Korea and the World — big progress! Look forward to our Summit."" The parties concerned now need to show the world that lasting peace and common development can be achieved through dialogue and consultation.         "

[Photo/Xinhua]   While three feet of ice will not be thawed in a day, as the Chinese saying goes, there have been more positive developments in efforts to melt the ice on the Korean Peninsula since Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, paid a visit to China last week.  After his trip to Beijing, Kim met with visiting International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, during the latter's three-day visit to Pyongyang, which ended on Saturday, and they agreed that the IOC will help the DPRK prepare for the participation in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, also joined an audience of hundreds in Pyongyang on Sunday for a performance by Republic of Korean K-pop singers, the first time such a show has been held in more than a decade.  Both developments were further signs of the DPRK's bid for rapprochement and engagement with the outside world, which of course is crucial if the forthcoming dialogues and any negotiations aimed at the peaceful denuclearization of the peninsula are to yield the desired outcomes.  However, this desirable momentum is vulnerable due to the mistrust that has festered over the years, and it could easily be disrupted or squandered. Not least by the joint military exercises between the US and the ROK that began on Sunday with more than 11,500 US and nearly 300,000 ROK troops taking part. The war games, known as Foal Eagle and Key Resolve, are being staged ahead of the summit between the DPRK and the ROK scheduled for April 27 and a meeting between the US and DPRK leaders penciled in for May.  Considering that the drills normally run about two months and the DPRK views them as a serious provocation, that the proposed talks would be held under the shadow of the US-ROK war games is hardly conducive to amicable discussions.  The thaw on the peninsula should not be taken lightly; it is a precious opportunity to start unraveling this complex historical knot. China hopes all the parties concerned will exercise the utmost restraint and jointly safeguard the current trend of reconciliation. Nothing is more important now than cherishing and sustaining the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring there is an atmosphere favorable for dialogue to bear fruit.         "

A meeting between the two leaders is reportedly in the works for sometime in May, although the time and place have not yet been announced.  After Kim concluded his visit to Beijing, Republic of Korea officials did confirm on Thursday that a meeting between ROK President Moon Jae-in and Kim is to be held on April 27 in the border truce village of Panmunjom. And Japan has reportedly also sounded out the DPRK about a bilateral summit.  Such meetings were inconceivable just a few months ago.  Needless to say, Beijing has been playing its part in realizing and sustaining the positive momentum, as Xi's invitation to Kim shows. But the welcome conciliation that has been achieved must now be cherished and nurtured. At this critical juncture, all the parties concerned should refrain from doing or saying anything that may shatter what is likely a fragile détente, given the suspicions and mistrust that have prevailed in the past. These will need to be assuaged if the opportunities presented by dialogue are to yield anything of substance.  That will require all concerned to show political wisdom, diplomatic flexibility and strategic patience, since the complex knot of history will not be easily unraveled. The stakes could not be higher, and the future will not judge kindly those who are insincere in their efforts to secure a peaceful resolution.  Those involved should also bear in mind that previously wasted opportunities led to the confrontational impasse from which all now hope to emerge unscathed.  It is our hope that the seeds of reconciliation that have been sown can be tended and bear fruit. China is willing to join hands with all parties to make such a prospect come true, and it hopes joint efforts will be made by all to nourish the tender buds of friendlier relations that have emerged this spring.

During the talks, Xi expressed warm welcome on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to Kim for his first visit to China.  Kim said, since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has, with tremendous political courage and a strong sense of responsibility, developed new thinking and new ideas, put them into action, and solved many tough problems that were never resolved and accomplished many big things that were long on the agenda but never got done. These achievements fully proved that the lines of the CPC are correct lines that accord with the national conditions. In particular, Comrade General Secretary has put forward the requirements that the Party should exercise effective self-supervision and practice strict self-governance in every respect, which has contributed greatly to Party building and realized the overall Party leadership over all work. At present, the WPK is also intensifying its efforts in fighting against arrogance, bureaucracy and corruption.

""It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,"" he said.  Kim said that the DPRK is determined to transform the inter-Korean ties into a relationship of reconciliation and cooperation and hold summit between the heads of the two sides.

During the visit, Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Kim before their talks. [Photo/Xinhua]   Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing this week, at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, shows that China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are maintaining close communication at what is ""a special time"", and it was of ""great significance"".  With the DPRK leader due to have summits with the leaders of Republic of Korea and the United States in the next two months, it is only natural that Xi and Kim should want to compare notes. Suggestions that Beijing had been sidelined by Pyongyang's approaches to Seoul and Washington were always unfounded given the two countries' long-standing friendship, which was forged in the crucible of war.  ""There was no question that my first foreign visit would be to the Chinese capital,"" Kim was quoted as saying by the DPRK's official news agency KCNA.  During the visit, Kim's first overseas trip since taking office in 2011, the two leaders held candid and friendly talks and reaffirmed the traditional friendship between the two countries, which Xi said was the right choice ""based on history and reality"".  Certainly, maintaining and developing the sound relationship between China and the DPRK is of strategic significance for the two neighbors to defend their own and shared interests. It is also in the interests of all since their friendly relations are also essential to maintain the strategic equilibrium in Northeast Asia and help keep potential risks at bay.  This year has seen a welcome easing of tensions on the peninsula, and all parties involved should value this hard-won opportunity and seek to make further progress.  China has repeatedly stressed that it supports all efforts that aim to ease tensions on the peninsula and get the parties concerned back to the negotiating table again.  And it is China's hope a solution that accommodates the interests and concerns of all stakeholders can be found at an early date so that the Korean Peninsula can emerge from under the shadow of conflict and embrace stability and prosperity.  With this in mind, Beijing has said it will continue to play a constructive role in brokering and facilitating talks, and it has called on all parties to support the improvement in inter-Korean ties and make concrete efforts to ensure the talks are a success.

          ","                          President Xi Jinping meets in Beijing on Monday with Chung Eui-yong, the top national security adviser to Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in. Chung briefed Xi on his denuclearization talks in Pyongyang and Washington. [Photo/Xinhua]   Expectations that a face-to-face meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un will put an abrupt end to the impasse on the Korean Peninsula will likely prove premature. But it is a necessary step in the required direction.  Trump has received criticism at home for accepting Kim’s invitation, which is to be expected. But he deserves praise for giving it a go. At least it is better than him trading insults with Kim. And he is certainly upbeat, and confident he can accomplish what was impossible for past US administrations. There is good reason for him to feel that way, since US-DPRK relations have deteriorated to such a degree that any slight thaw in relations between the two is welcome.  Especially since Pyongyang saw the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as an opportunity to warm relations with Seoul and the two have rapidly melted the long-standing chill on the Korean Peninsula.  Yet even if the meeting between Trump and Kim does go ahead, what happens next will probably be protracted haggling. After all, Pyongyang will not give up its nuclear weapons for nothing. Kim is likely to raise Pyongyang’s desire for a peace treaty, along with establishing diplomatic relations, while Washington will not recognize the long hostile regime in Pyongyang without denuclearization.  But that is precisely what Beijing, whose active support and contribution to fostering the talks was praised by Republic of Korea national security director Chung Eui-yong who is visiting China to brief Beijing on the recent inter-Korean talks, has persistently urged both Pyongyang and Washington to discuss directly.  No wonder it sees the latest development as being “in the right direction”, and as President Xi Jinping told Chung on Monday, it will continue to facilitate such engagement.  Xi urged all parties to be patient and use their political wisdom to address and resolve their problems.  Certainly the anxiety and discord that had previously found expression in the rancorous exchanges of outrage and insults between Trump and Kim need to be put on the back burner if any positive outcome is to materialize from a meeting between the two leaders.  Since all stakeholders say they seek a political solution to the longstanding security threat, this is a precious opportunity that should not be wasted.         "

That it is the first time Kim has met any ROK officials in person since he took power in late 2011 raises the hope the rapprochement this time may not just be a repeat of the thaw-to-tension cycle that has been witnessed before.  Thus it is welcome news that Kim's call for a summit meeting to promote ""dialogue, contact, cooperation and exchange"" during his four-hours with the ROK envoys has been accepted by Seoul.  Pyongyang cannot blame others if the concrete steps it has been taking lately to improve inter-Korea ties, including its participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the ROK last month, are greeted with a degree of caution, as the world has seen it extend the olive branch before only for it to continue with its nuclear and missile programs afterwards.  But this time there is a difference as the head of the ROK delegation stated on Tuesday that Pyongyang said it had no need to possess nuclear weapons if there is no military threat against it, and it explicitly expressed its willingness to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, a willingness the world wants to see it act upon.  It has made it clear it considers such weapons a necessity for survival — something that US President Donald Trump's talk of ""fire and fury"" only served to reinforce, recalling as it did the US’ saturation bombing of the DPRK during the Korean War. The annual joint military drills between the US and the ROK, postponed for the Winter Olympics and set to resume later this spring, also serve to amplify Pyongyang's existential angst.  Washington should not believe that by simply possessing such weapons the DPRK will incite violence against the United States. What Pyongyang wants is a peace treaty and security guarantees.  Instead of threats and war drills, the US needs to realize that to promote peace requires it to demonstrate to the DPRK a disposition of benevolence that can overcome Pyongyang’s mistrust and belief that the US' real aim is regime change.  Washington should take its cue from the outcome of the meetings between Kim and the ROK envoys and seize this opportunity as the best way to prevent the rhetoric of war being realized.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   Targeting one Chinese individual, 27 entities and 28 vessels of China, the United States announced on Friday what its Treasury Department called ""the largest North Korea-related sanctions tranche to date"". Whose failure, according to US President Donald Trump, may lead to a ""phase two"", which he said would be ""very rough"", and ""very, very unfortunate for the world"".  In the meantime, his administration is reportedly working on a plan to significantly intensify interceptions of ships suspected of violating the UN sanctions imposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in the hope of plugging a loophole that allegedly allows Pyongyang to finance its weapons programs via maritime smuggling.  Such moves only threaten to jeopardize the current Olympic inter-Korean détente that has brought hopes of way out of the dangerous predicament on the Korean Peninsula, with the Republic of Korea saying on Sunday that the DPRK is willing to hold direct talks with the US. Those with an optimistic outlook hope such talks happen and lead to negotiations that secure a lasting peace agreement.  Well-wishers have always hoped for the best-case scenario in dealing with the DPRK nuclear crisis – resolving it within the UN framework with little pain, if any, inflicted. But the current easing of tensions, encouraging as it is, is only a window of opportunity that can shut at any moment.  While it is open it needs to be made the most of. Trump’s threats, even if intended as a pressure tactic, along with his adherence to the position that Pyongyang take concrete steps toward denuclearization first, will only slam the window closed, restarting the vicious cycle of tit-for-tat actions that had threatened to get out of hand prior to the current inter-Korean cordiality.  The UN-endorsed sanctions are the best way to encourage the DPRK to regard its nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip to get the security guarantees it needs, rather than only means of guaranteeing its security.  For those sanctions to bite, however, besides the sanctions themselves being tough enough, they have to be carried out.  Yet that does not justify Washington adopting a ""long-arm"" approach to carrying out those sanctions. The biggest pitfall to concerted efforts to put an end to the DPRK’s nuclear adventure through sanctions is for Washington to divide the international coalition by seeking to unilaterally punish entities and individuals that violate the UN sanctions rather than letting the violators be dealt with by the stakeholders concerned under domestic laws.  It has been said that wisdom consists of knowing how to distinguish the nature of trouble, and being able to choose the lesser evil. Rather than harking back to his earlier threat of ""fire and fury"", Trump should accept Pyongyang’s offer of talks and work with all stakeholders to end the crisis and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula peacefully.

          ","                      United States Vice-President Mike Pence went to Pyeongchang committed to foiling Pyongyang’s alleged attempt to “hijack the message and imagery” of the Olympics. He left insisting “there is no daylight” among the US, Japan and the Republic of Korea on sustaining the strategy of extreme pressure. However, the latest developments offer no clue whether that is indeed the case or not. Athletes from both sides of the 38th parallel marched into the stadium under a “Korean Peninsula” flag and sat shoulder to shoulder behind the podium, where IOC President Thomas Bach gave a sentimental eulogy to the power of unity. The ROK President Moon Jae-in promised to “make it happen” upon receiving a handwritten invitation from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un for a visit “at the earliest date possible”, and officials of the two Koreas talked for three hours over lunch, sharing soju. Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the DPRK leader, reportedly left a message expressing hope for “unification and prosperity in the near future”, and the visiting art troupe from Pyongyang stirred up another round of romantic anticipation surrounding the abrupt détente. Everything negative about the DPRK, even its military parade the day before, appeared forgotten. No wonder US media lamented the US was “left in the cold”. Indeed, even Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was found greeting Kim Yong-nam, head of the DPRK delegation. President Moon may be a little more anxious to exploit these developments than Washington would feel comfortable with. The warm welcome extended to Pyongyang officials was certainly not what the White House wanted. Moon’s suggestion that Pyongyang should seek negotiations with Washington was a fitting reminder, both to Pyongyang and the rest of the world, that inter-Korean reconciliation is difficult without engaging that crucial third party. Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington, critical as they are, have remained impossible to date because neither party appears ready to compromise and make the first move, as the US is resolutely opposing talks until the North agrees to end its nuclear program, and the DPRK is equally adamant that its nuclear capacities are non-negotiable. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped the welcome improvement in the situation on the Korean Peninsula can be sustained and built upon, rather than being allowed to slip back into the previously capricious instability.

[Photo: VCG]   Co-hosted by the United States and Canada, the gathering of the foreign ministers of the allies that fought on the side of the United States in the Korean War has further complicated what was already a grave crisis.  The participants claimed the meeting, which concluded on Tuesday, was held because it was their firm and shared desire to avoid a devastating conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Yet the signal it has sent has been exactly the opposite.  Held at a time when the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have been in direct communication for the first time in two years, the meeting invoked the battle lines of the past conflict, with China and Russia not invited to have a say in the proceedings.  Rather than nurturing the positive changes and working with all parties to jointly maintain the hard-won momentum for the resumption of talks, as President Xi Jinping has urged, the meeting once again reinforced the impression that the US is not interested in a solution that is in the interests of all, but rather in determining an end-state to the crisis that is of its choosing.  The talk in Vancouver was all about tougher sanctions and greater pressure on Pyongyang, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson once again warning the DPRK could trigger “a military response” if it did not mend its ways, and verifiably and irreversibly abandon all of its weapons of mass destruction.  It seems that trouble like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For although the talks between Pyongyang and Seoul have not been directly engineered by the US and will not disarm the DPRK’s nuclear arsenal, and they may indeed be simply a ploy by Pyongyang to stall for time, they have at least helped ease what were becoming extremely acute and volatile tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  Instead of being greeted with a stick, the engagement between Pyongyang and Seoul should have been encouraged with the offering of a carrot.  Many times Washington has expressed the possibility of direct talks with Pyongyang, although on terms it defines.  For those terms to be met, it has to play its part by choosing the path of engagement and negotiation, instead of obstinately pursuing its own course that makes the prospects of finding a solution ever more remote each time an opportunity emerges.

[Photo: VCG]   The so-called Vancouver Group, formed by more than a dozen countries that fought in the Korean War, claims the lofty goal of ""strengthening diplomatic efforts toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula"". But the foreign ministers meeting Canada and the United States are co-hosting is anything but conducive to advancing that claimed goal.  A diplomatic solution to the nuclear/missile crisis and ultimate denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is best for all. And Beijing, for one, has been a steadfast advocate of diplomacy, and welcomes all endeavors oriented at a peaceful resolution.  The Vancouver event, however, is a poorly conceived gathering that will prove counter-productive to that end.  Judging from what has been said and heard, an important, if not central, topic is to be mounting additional pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea via further international sanctions. This is based on the assumption that the United Nations-imposed sanctions have worked and pressed DPRK leader Kim Jong-un to seek a thaw in inter-Korean ties.  Yet at a moment when Pyongyang and Seoul are just beginning a rare detente and talking about further extending mutual goodwill, what good will rhetoric about further sanctions do? What message do they want to send? Can't talk about additional sanctions wait until Pyongyang makes another provocation? Its timing alone appears illogically inopportune.  Not to mention that both concerned insiders and outsiders have pointed out the limitations of the meeting because of the exclusion of China and Russia. Rather than their absence, the Vancouver gathering is more about who is present — the countries represented are primarily those that sent troops to the Korean War as part of the ""allied forces"". Again, what is the message here?  It may be possible for a peaceful solution to be found without engaging Beijing or Moscow. Really, with Seoul and Pyongyang paving the way, who can exclude the likelihood of the US president talking with Kim?  But that remains a low probability. So what good does the gathering do since it merely polarizes stances?  While many suspect Kim is seeking to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington with his olive branch to the former, Ottawa and Washington have taken a move of similarly divisive potential.  Instead of nipping in the bud the dialogue that needs carefully nurturing, the members of the Vancouver Group should be seeking diplomatic ways to help it flourish.         "

XINHUA     It is good that the talks between the two Koreas on Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom appeared amicable and constructive, with both delegations seemingly intent on making the meeting a success, even making quips about the winter weather and their frosty relations.  And the unusual, if not unprecedented, suggestion by Ri Son-gwon, the chief delegate of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, that the talks be “open and transparent” and their content be made public “in light of the great expectations and huge interest both here and abroad” and to demonstrate its “sincerity and endeavors” was itself something of a break with the past.  It is now almost certain that we will see athletes of the DPRK competing in the Winter Olympics being held in the Republic of Korea next month, and we may witness something similar to the scenes at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, when athletes from both sides of the 38th Parallel marched under one “Korean Peninsula” banner in identical uniforms at the opening ceremony.  It is also likely that families divided by the Korean War may get another precious opportunity to meet their loved ones amid this sudden exchange of goodwill.  Then, if things go well, looking forward at the best-case scenario, the latest rapport might extend further, toward a longer-lasting thaw in inter-Korea relations.  However, as history has repeatedly proved, inter-Korea ties are too fickle to support unbounded optimism. It is very hard to tell whether the current rapprochement will outlast the upcoming Winter Games, and if so for how long.  And the upbeat assumption of the ROK’s chief delegate Cho Myoung-gyon that “well-begun is half done”, may be more applicable to inter-Korea ties than the broader peninsula issues.  While tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang may be assuaged, at least for the time being, the dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula has not suddenly dissipated. Not only because there are other stakeholders, but also because Pyongyang still resists relinquishing its pursuit of nuclear weapons, grounds for war according to the United States, which has been placed in the firing line.  Although US President Donald Trump again indicated willingness to personally talk with Kim Jong-un on Saturday, his US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley immediately stated the precondition was Kim stop weapons testing for a “significant amount of time”.  However, that does not slam the door shut, as Kim can easily satisfy that request. And after their useless trading of insults, both Trump and Kim may want to try something different.  In that case, the meeting in Panmunjom may well prove to be a welcome New Year’s gift.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   Although the signs of easing animosity on the Korean Peninsula are welcome, the offer of talks from Kim Jong-un may represent merely a transient change of tone, rather than a shift in policy, and his overture is likely to come with a price tag.Kim's nice-guy approach may not last long, if Pyongyang fails to get what it covets. Be that the easing of sanctions, grain, oil or anything else that helps it subsist. Certainly that has been the case in several past attempts at ice-breaking.Yet, be that as it may, what matters now is whether the relevant parties can maneuver a meaningful break from the tense standoff that has developed on the peninsula.Since almost all stakeholders are in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis, they should not let a chance like this slip by without giving it a try. Pyongyang has a poor track record credibility-wise. But what if it is seriously eager for engagement this time? United States President Donald Trump may very well be correct in observing Pyongyang's olive branch to Seoul shows ""sanctions and 'other' measures are beginning to have a big impact"".And the stakeholders have the option of substantially upgrading sanctions if Pyongyang does revert to past practices.Therefore, instead of flippantly and childishly claiming to have a ""much bigger and more powerful nuclear button"", the US president should try to be supportive of Seoul's enthusiasm for talking with Pyongyang.US UN envoy Nikki Haley says her country would not take any talks seriously since, instead of ""a Band-Aid"", they want Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons now.But a Band-Aid is exactly what Seoul wants while it hosts the Winter Olympics next month.And the intended dialogue on Olympic cooperation does have the potential to lead to further inter-Korean engagement.Kim reopened a key cross-border communication channel with the Republic of Korea for the first time in nearly two years on Wednesday, as the rivals explored the possibility of sitting down and talking after months of acrimony and fears of war.And Seoul has responded positively and agreed to talk next Tuesday on cooperation regarding the Winter Olympics. Such diplomatic pragmatism could serve Seoul well, at least for the duration of the games. However, it is to be hoped that something more substantive can be produced beyond that if the two sides can proceed in the current direction of engagement.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   For ROK President Moon Jae-in, the New Year's Day message from his counterpart in the north will probably have come as something of a New Year's gift.  Although its past practices may contradict its claim to be a responsible nation, at least for now the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea seems to be acting as one by extending a ""welcome"" olive branch to the Republic of Korea .  While it might be, as speculated, simply an attempt to sow discord between the United States and the ROK, or simply a move to buy time for his nuclear/missile programs, it may perhaps be better to consider the DPRK’s offer to send a team to the coming Winter Olympics as a good-will answer to Moon's recent proposal to suspend joint military drills and view it as Seoul seems to be doing as the opening of a window of opportunity.  For despite the usual threat meant to deter the US from acting rashly, in this instance his statement that he has a nuclear button on his desk, Kim Jong-un did express an interest in ending the ""unstable state which is neither war nor peace"", as well as an eagerness to ""sit down for talks"". Better yet, the DPRK leader pledged to work with the ROK to ""lower military tensions on the Korean Peninsula"" with an eye on a ""peaceful resolution"".  While the reunification Kim Jong-un spoke of is more likely than not on his terms, and thus can be regarded as little more than a bid to remind Seoul of the current state of affairs, his speech may be a credible sign that Pyongyang does want, perhaps needs, to find a way to escape the spiraling tensions it has helped to foster.  Although there is a huge question mark surrounding the olive branch that has been offered — after all, the world has seen athletes from both sides of the 38th Parallel stand shoulder-to-shoulder under the Olympic banner, before and afterwards seen everything go back to as it was before; and Pyongyang’s past rhetoric about its desire for peace has repeatedly been offset by fresh provocations — that is no reason to give Kim’s overture the cold shoulder. Considering the clear and all too present danger being brewed by what have been recently rapidly escalating tensions, no sign hinting at a potential breakthrough should be ignored. Not least since this has been the first seemingly serious one from Kim since he became leader.         "

[Photo/Agencies]   In what for diplomats in Beijing is a major achievement, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution which many believe would at once lower the likelihood of war, and convey a warning to Pyongyang.  Resolution 2397, the 10th UN Security Council has passed imposing sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is in the first place a sign of international solidarity against Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program. That, despite their differences, member countries have agreed to up the ante by imposing tougher sanctions reflects they still believe a peaceful, political, diplomatic solution to the Korean Peninsula problem is possible.  Given the resolution's meticulous detail, avoiding to inflict humanitarian losses and impair normal economic activities, the latest sanctions would prove a low-cost approach if they succeed in prompting Pyongyang back to the negotiation table. But for that to happen, the sanctions have to be enforced by all stakeholders in good faith, as Pyongyang appears determined and perhaps desperate to become a strong nuclear power.  The resolution did send a clear message to Pyongyang: the international community remains united-and is more determined-in stopping its nuclear/missile provocations and in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and it can achieve it peacefully.  Mixed as it is, the DPRK's response reveals considerable ambivalence. On the one hand, it has condemned the fresh sanctions as an ""act of war"" ""tantamount to complete economic blockade"", claiming again that nuclear deterrence is the only way to deal with the United States. On the other hand, it just decided to open a new ""economic development zone"" in Pyongyang to attract overseas investments.  Obviously, the DPRK can't have it both ways. It has to choose one or the other-definitely not both. It can't expect meaningful foreign investment with UN sanctions in place. It cannot use opening up economically as a ploy to undermine UN sanctions.  Beijing and Moscow have worked tirelessly to make sure the peninsula nuclear issue is resolved peacefully, without any political or economic implosion in the DPRK. If their own security interests have made both to seek a peaceful resolution, they will also prompt the two countries to prevent a nuclear-armed DPRK.  If Pyongyang chooses to repeat its stock tricks in defiance of the collective will of the international community, and Resolution 2379 does not yield expected results, there will be a collective move to further tighten the noose.  What happens next hinges to a great extent not only on what a choice Pyongyang makes, but also how Washington acts. And surely Pyongyang will view statements such as the one made by US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley on Friday as a provocation. If Washington is really sincere about bringing Pyongyang back to the negotiation table-which the international community certainly is-US officials should think before they talk.         "

          ","                      As the only party to come up with a relatively comprehensive prescription for ending the protracted wrangling over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear weapons program, with its proposal that the United States and the Republic of Korea suspend joint military drills and Pyongyang to suspend nuclear/missile tests, Beijing is trying everything possible to make sure that war and chaos do not materialize on the Korean Peninsula. Its latest proposal again calls for restraint and mutual non-provocation. Thankfully the other parties - with Tokyo perhaps the sole exception - also seem to find a political solution more preferable now. After talking with President Xi Jinping, visiting ROK President Moon Jae-in fully endorsed Beijing's ""no war, no chaos"" position in a Friday speech at Peking University, even offering a bright future for the DPRK if it ""makes the right choice"". And remarkably both Pyongyang and Washington have highlighted a desire for peace while affirming no giving in to provocations, something they both reiterated at a ministerial-level meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday. Since the shared will is there, the question now is how to deliver on it. Beijing's latest proposal for resolving the crisis boils down to the parties concerned using restraint, fully implementing UN resolutions and resorting to engagement. The DPRK and the United States are the parties directly concerned and they need to talk if there is to be a peaceful final settlement of the issue. However, there remains a lack of trust that both sides need to make efforts to overcome. It would be great if US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's earlier offer of unconditional talks were to be backed up by the White House as then it might be taken seriously by Pyongyang, which in turn should respond to the US president's call for proper conditions for talks. On Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the standoff on the Korean Peninsula ""the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today"", and it is reaching a critical juncture where all players in the game need to conduct a reality check and make an informed choice, or end up losing big. As Beijing urges, the parties concerned should exercise restraint and do all they can to seek engagement.   (China Daily 12/18/2017 page8)                                 "
"Washington and Pyongyang must back words with actions","

[Photo/Agencies]   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday offered to start direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. ""Let's just meet,"" Tillerson said in a speech in Washington, moving away from the stumbling block of the United States' previous demand that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear arsenal.  The softening of US position seems to be in response to Pyongyang's expressed desire for direct talks with Washington, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week he had passed on to his US counterpart.The possibility of talks when the worst-case scenario seemed to be looming ever nearer would certainly be welcome.  The problem is whether Tillerson's words count. If Pyongyang is to take the message seriously, Washington at least has to speak in one voice. Hours after Tillerson said the two countries could meet and just talk about the weather if that is what it took to get the ball rolling, the White House said President Donald Trump's views on the issue ""had not changed"".  Trump has previously said that the secretary of state was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with"" Pyongyang, and the US will do ""what has to be done"". Such rhetoric, in addition to the massive joint military drills between the US and the Republic of Korea on the peninsula, including the biggest-ever joint air exercise last week, will have only increased Pyongyang's sense of insecurity, and made it more desperate than ever to secure its survival with nuclear weapons.  But, on the other hand, Pyongyang can't have its cake and eat it too. It cannot expect Washington to engage in direct peace talks with it, while at the same time making such talks more difficult by continuing with its missile launches and nuclear tests in defiance of the United Nations resolutions that ban such reckless moves.  A ""period of quiet"", as Tillerson put it, is indispensable if the deep-rooted distrust between the two sides is to be eased.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea should realize that bolstering up its nuclear force does not make it safer, rather it threatens catastrophe to itself and the region.  To avoid the worst-case scenario, the US and the DPRK must waste no time in engaging in direct talks and discussing more than just the weather.         "

          ","                                             Less than a week after Pyongyang test-fired a new ballistic missile presumed capable of reaching the United States, and two days after the US and the Republic of Korea launched their biggest-ever joint air exercise, the fact that a senior United Nations official was in Pyongyang for discussions with a leading official of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea raises hopes that diplomacy can still defuse the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis. What Jeffrey Feltman, UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, and DPRK Vice-Foreign Minister Pak Myong Guk talked about on Wednesday remains unclear. But it is to be hoped that the UN envoy at least helped forestall a final showdown on the peninsula, even if he cannot talk total sense into the DPRK leadership. The odds on a full-scale war breaking out on the peninsula have never been higher, with the US warning the regime in Pyongyang will ""be utterly destroyed"", and the DPRK countering by saying that Washington is ""begging for nuclear war"". Any misjudgment or miscalculation threatens to turn this war of words into hostilities that would put the lives of millions of people in peril. That Jilin Daily, a local newspaper in China's Jilin province bordering the DPRK, published a full page of ""common sense"" advice on Wednesday informing people how to protect themselves from a nuclear explosion sparked speculation among Chinese netizens about how imminent war was. Although it should not be hyped up, the newspaper's move does shed some light on how sensitive the Korean Peninsula issue is. Despite Beijing's best efforts to persuade the DPRK to suspend its nuclear warhead and missile tests, and the US to suspend its military drills with the Republic of Korea, the two belligerents seem to be set on a head-on collision. The window to avoiding the worst-case scenario has not yet closed. There is still time for stakeholders to put aside their differences and work jointly so that reason will prevail. Wars may begin with an end in mind, but do not necessarily end how and when you please. An armistice has been in place for 64 years, surely it is time all the stakeholders sat down and thrashed out a permanent peace deal.           "

          ","                                             A week after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea tested its most sophisticated and powerful intercontinental ballistic missile to date, the United States and the Republic of Korea began joint air force exercises on the Korean Peninsula on Monday.  The drill reportedly involves some of the US' most advanced military hardware, including F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters, and perhaps B1-B bombers.  However, the power disparity in favor of the US and the ROK is unlikely to put a break on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.  After launching that widely condemned ICBM in defiance of United Nations sanctions, Pyongyang is now accusing the US and ROK of pushing ""the already acute situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of nuclear war"" and saying they will ""pay dearly for their provocations"".  With neither side indicating any willingness to give the ""dual suspension"" proposal, aimed at creating an environment conducive to talks, serious consideration, the brinksmanship between the US and the DPRK is set to continue, and escalate.  There is real danger in the game they are playing, as the bellicose posturing between the US and DPRK leaders is raising the stakes to the point where they are putting their own futures as leaders on the line. With both counting on the other to fold, that is high-stakes play that risks misjudgment and conflict, and puts regional stability in jeopardy.  As unappealing as it may appear to them as they grandstand for their respective audiences, the best bet for both would be declaring a willingness to negotiate.  The rest of the international community can help in this regard. The imperative task they share is to make sure everything spelt out in the UN Security Council resolutions is honestly implemented. They can lower the stakes by demonstrating unity and thereby sending the unmistakable message that UN sanctions will be carried out to the letter and be sustained.  For their part, the stakeholders should consult with one another, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. Unilateral actions, especially if they create discord among stakeholders, will only embolden the two principal players to up the ante even higher.  The message the leaders of the two countries keep sending one another is nuclear war is imminent and that is what the world keeps hearing and fearing.  Yet that nightmare scenario remains unlikely. More likely is the US keeps applying pressure in the hope the situation keeps deteriorating on the current track until the current regime in the DPRK collapses. This would produce a chain reaction of consequences that are both possible and probable, and really should be feared if the two main players continue to play their dangerous game.         "

          ","                                              File photo provided by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Feb. 13, 2017 shows a test firing of a surface-to-surface medium- and long-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2 on Feb. 12, 2017. [Xinhua/KCNA]      Unilateral countermoves by individual stakeholders have proven insufficient, and ineffective, in reining in the nuclear weapons program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as its latest missile test on Wednesday demonstrated.   While the accumulative effect of Pyongyang's most recent series of tests has been a hardening of the consensus among the stakeholders that they should come to an end, there is still no well-coordinated collective response to achieve that aim.   The Republic of Korea responded to the latest DPRK missile test with a missile firing of its own within minutes, knowing full well it was a meaningless gesture.   After the launch, the DPRK's state news agency KCNA declared that Pyongyang had now achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, calling the weapons a defense against the ""nuclear blackmail policy"" of the United States. Although analysts suggest such missiles would be unable to hit the US carrying a nuclear warhead, the launch was enough for US President Donald Trump to issue one of his enigmatic statements - ""We will take care of it.""   Which is worrying. His recent unilateral move to tighten the screw of sanctions - by renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of terrorism - only served to accentuate the belief that his interest in diplomacy is simply for show.   Helpless as he is, ROK President Moon Jae-in is correct in observing the real danger is ""the situation could get out of control if North Korea perfects its ICBM technology"".   As a key stakeholder in the unfolding confrontation between Pyongyang and Washington, Beijing is in an awkward position, bearing the brunt of the blame for the failure to stop Pyongyang's nuclear missile program, even though that failure has essentially been everyone's, and being criticized for ""inaction"", which totally ignores the truth.   Beijing wants the two belligerents to calm down as much as anyone. It is vexed that a golden opportunity to build concerted momentum to encourage Pyongyang to engage in talks has been so casually wasted by the Trump administration's recent action of renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of state terrorism, which may have prompted Pyongyang's latest missile launch.   There is a severe trust deficit among the relevant parties that is being repeatedly exacerbated by the actions of Washington and Pyongyang. This, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, is moving the situation further away from the point where a settlement of the crisis can begin.   Which means the clock is ticking down to one of two choices: learning to live with the DPRK having nuclear weapons or triggering a tripwire to the worst-case scenario. But there is a third choice, which the US keeps ignoring. That is for all stakeholders to genuinely pull together to put an end to Pyongyang's dangerous game once and for all through dialogue and a peace treaty.   To achieve this, as Beijing has consistently argued, requires accommodating the concerns of the various parties and following the proposed step-by-step plan to establish the conditions necessary for dialogue.

[Photo/Agencies]      The United States on Tuesday slapped fresh sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and three Chinese companies were blacklisted as part of what US Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin called the US' ""maximum pressure campaign"" to isolate Pyongyang.  China keeps getting caught in the crosshairs of this campaign. This is the third time this year that Chinese companies and individuals have fallen victim to US sanctions against the DPRK.  Heather Nauert, a US State Department spokeswoman, said she did not think targeting more Chinese companies would affect Beijing's cooperation on the DPRK issue-""We have a good relationship with China. That's not going to change.""  However, as China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, resorting to long-arm jurisdiction based on its own domestic laws and regulations is the wrong method for forging effective cooperation.  China aims to strictly implement the UN Security Council resolutions, and the US should share any intelligence it might have of Chinese individuals or companies violating them so that China can investigate for itself any contravention of its international obligations.  Talking is the right way to guarantee a good relationship. And, as Beijing has repeatedly said, Washington and Pyongyang need to start talking if lasting stability is to be secured.  Washington may feel the need to continuously increase its pressure on Pyongyang given the latter's repeated missile and nuclear weapons testing, not least to demonstrate to the US public it is doing something, especially because the sanctions imposed by the UN will take time to have the desired effect. But while doubling up on first its military threats and now its sanctions, Washington should keep in mind its aim should be getting Pyongyang to talk.  It should also bear in mind that Beijing and Washington are in the same boat, and that good momentum has been achieved recently.  In the latest developments, bilateral ties between China and the Republic of Korea have improved rapidly since they decided to properly handle their differences over the deployment of a US antimissile system in the ROK. The ROK's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha is on an official visit to Beijing this week.  While on Tuesday, the Kremlin announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had exchanged views on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue with US President Donald Trump in a phone conversation.  These are just the latest efforts in the intensive diplomacy that the various stakeholders are engaged in. Diplomacy that should drive home the message they share the political will to secure a peaceful and lasting resolution to the issue. All the stakeholders need to continue to walk in same direction, as they have seemed to be doing recently.  With the DPRK's ruling party also expressing the wish to strengthen inter-party exchanges with China, which suggests it wants to keep the door open, now is not the time for the US to step back from cooperation.

[Photo/Agencies]      Despite his war of words with the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump expressed his preference for a diplomatic solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis during his recent trip to Asia.  Yet in a move that seems to go directly against this professed intention, Trump put the DPRK back on the United States' terrorism blacklist on Monday.  The designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism will only further alienate the country. It makes the prospects for talks much dimmer, and may even eliminate the possibility of any talks.  The move comes at a time when the Korean Peninsula had become calmer. For more than two months, Pyongyang has refrained from conducting any missile and nuclear tests.  The US' designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism could lay waste to the efforts of China and Russia to bring the DPRK back to the negotiation table. Instead, it could be used by Pyongyang as a pretext to renew its weapons tests, thus restarting the vicious circle of escalating tensions on the peninsula that had seemed in danger of spiraling out of control.  Besides whether the DPRK meets the legal requirements for being relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism is questionable, even at the US State Department. Trump has based the designation on the alleged killing of Kim's half brother Kim Jong-nam by DPRK agents at Kuala Lumpur airport in February. But even if this proves to be the case, lawyers say there has to be more than one terrorist incident to substantiate the claim.  The designation seems more like an excuse for the US to seek the highest level of sanctions against Pyongyang as part of its proclaimed ""maximum pressure campaign"".  But the DPRK has already been under crushing sanctions imposed by the United Nations and other countries, which restrict its oil imports and ban most of its exports, aimed at depriving it of funds for its nuclear and missile programs. It takes time for such sanctions to bite, there is no evidence that further sanctions will achieve more immediate results in constraining Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Even US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson admitted the designation is a ""very symbolic move"" and their ""practical effects may be limited"".  The DPRK has justified its pursuit of nuclear weapons with its existential concerns, insisting the weapons will help it better defend itself from the threat of a US invasion. The latest US move only serves to fan that fear-given what happened to Iraq and Libya-and does a disservice to easing the already tense situation on the peninsula. Instead, as China said on Tuesday, ""more should be done"" to resolve the crisis through dialogue.         "

          ","                              President Xi Jinping (R) meets with Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in in Da Nang, Vietnam, Nov 11, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea Kang Kyung-wha is scheduled to visit Beijing on Tuesday to hold bilateral talks with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Reports by the ROK media say Kang's trip is to prepare for an upcoming summit between the leaders of the two countries.  Kang's visit underscores the two neighbors' earnestness in wanting to fully restore bilateral ties at an early date.  Relations soured after the previous ROK administration decided to deploy the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK. But the two sides announced they would bring bilateral relations back onto their normal track at the end of last month.  This came after Kang told ROK lawmakers that Seoul would not seek additional THAAD deployment and there has been no change in Seoul's stance that it will not participate in the US-led missile defense system. Since then, Beijing and Seoul have sought to rebuild momentum in their bilateral interactions.  President Xi Jinping met his ROK counterpart Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting earlier this month in Da Nang, Vietnam. A visit by Moon to Beijing next month would signal good relations are well on the way to being fully restored.  The current thaw in bilateral ties would not have happened had the ROK not realized the necessity of adjusting its policy on THAAD.  Moon has adopted a different approach to his predecessor. As his adviser said on Monday, Moon is seeking to build trust with China, Russia and Mongolia through economic cooperation and hopes to eventually expand the cooperation to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The strong political resolve and matching actions it has displayed to resolve the THAAD issue have paved the way for China and the ROK to restore trust. It is to be hoped Seoul will honor the commitments it has made.  Mending the fences of bilateral ties epitomizes the political wisdom of the two neighbors. It not only serves their own interests but also caters to the efforts to break the tensions arising from the antagonism between the US and the DPRK.  The situation has been threatening to spin out of control with the rhetoric of Washington and Pyongyang becoming increasingly aggressive. The shared determination of both sides to defuse the crisis without resorting to military options will surely help prevent that nightmare scenario from occurring.  China and the ROK have common interests in pursuing regional peace and stability. Something Xi rightly pointed out during his meeting with Moon in Vietnam.  And the public in the ROK is clearly appreciative of Moon's change of approach. His approval rating has climbed to over 70 percent in recent weeks.  The renewed rapport between Beijing and Seoul ties will help build on fruitful communication among stakeholders in the Korean Peninsula issue of late. This in turn can help create conditions conducive to resolving the issue through dialogue.         "

It was the case in Japan and the Republic of Korea. And it will very likely be the case in China, which is next on his itinerary.  After his war rhetoric of recent weeks, Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory and optimistic note on Tuesday in the ROK, expressing his strongest inclination yet that he was willing to deal with rising tensions with the DPRK through diplomacy, urging Pyongyang to ""come to the table"" and ""make a deal"".  But, once again, he also emphasized the military firepower the US can bring to bear.   Even from the perspective of crisis prevention, Trump should be availing himself of the opportunities presented by his visits to the three countries, and his anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to maneuver a consensus on how to deliver on the progress he says he sees. After all, as some US lawmakers noted on Saturday, ""there are no good military options"".  Beijing has repeatedly encouraged the United States and the DPRK to carry out direct dialogue as this is the only way to increase their understanding of each other's positions.   Pyongyang should take Trump's offer seriously. Ignoring this diplomatic olive branch, it may miss a historic opportunity for improving ties with Washington.  The restraint both Washington and Pyongyang have demonstrated so far — Trump steering clear of the Demilitarized Zone and Pyongyang not carrying out a missile or nuclear test for the longest period in recent months — is a hopeful sign that both prefer to find a peaceful solution to their predicaments.   Beijing has made relentless efforts to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means, and it will continue to play a constructive role by promoting tangible moves to bring the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue back to the track of political settlement at an early date.  While Trump did not elaborate on what he meant when telling US and ROK military commanders on Tuesday, ""Ultimately it will all work out, it always works out, it has to work out.""  We just hope he was speaking on the same wavelength as ROK President Moon Jae-in, who said he hoped Trump's visit would be a turning point in the crisis and that the two leaders had agreed to resolve the DPRK nuclear issue ""in peaceful manner"" that would ""bring permanent peace"".

After the ROK stated on Monday that it is not considering any additional deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, and it will not participate in US defense networks or develop its security cooperation with Japan and the United States into a tripartite military alliance, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday that the two sides have agreed to bring their relations back onto the normal track as soon as possible.  It was the decision by the previous administration in the ROK to deploy the United States' THAAD anti-missile system in response to Pyongyang's repeated reckless moves that put the freeze on relations, since China views the deployment as a threat to its security.  However, China and the ROK maintained communication regarding the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through diplomatic channels, and they have agreed to enhance their communication, including through military-to-military channels, in pursuit of their shared aim of achieving a peaceful resolution to the issue.  Since both countries are important stakeholders in peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, their restored rapport will help them better coordinate their stances in response to the deteriorating relations between the DPRK and the US that threaten to spark a military conflict.  And by showing their shared will to properly handle their differences over THAAD, the two neighbors can now revive their economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, which have borne the brunt of the downturn in bilateral ties over past months.  This will also enable them to better fulfill their responsibilities and contribute more to regional integration by making concerted efforts.  As regional economic powerhouses, China and the ROK, along with Japan, have been long-time cooperative partners and participants in the regional integration process led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and they are being looked upon to play a bigger role in regional development by other countries in the region.  The thaw in China-ROK ties will hopefully be a shot in the arm to efforts to forge regional solidarity and cooperation at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders' Meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, and the series of East Asia high-level meetings in Manila, the Philippines, next month.

[Photo/Agencies]      Symbolism matters on diplomatic occasions, and it will during the planned visit of US President Donald Trump to China later this year. Plenty of thought is no doubt being devoted to it, and plenty of endeavors will be underway to make sure his visit is successful, even fruitful.  However, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ongoing trip to Beijing must be anything but symbolic.        Rather than being a routine show of mutual goodwill to set the stage for Trump's visit, the guest and his hosts must avail themselves of their meetings to engage in candid communication to straighten at least one thing out-what each can expect from the other to ensure the situation on the Korean Peninsula does not deteriorate and spiral out of control.  Of course trade is important. It may actually be the foremost topic addressed during the meetings, particularly as fear of a potential trade war looms large on both sides of the Pacific. Mutual assurances are indispensable for averting that scenario.  But as long as both parties make room for some give-and-take on trade issues, Tillerson's talks will be of more immediate portent if they can take some of the heat out of the peninsula's inflammable nuclear crisis.  Both Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un appear jumpy these days. And the rest of the world seems to have grown increasingly blasé about this of late, even as the two leaders exchange vows of mutual destruction, few seem ready to believe their words should be taken seriously.  Perhaps; but that does not mean nothing will happen. The escalating exchanges of threats and insults pose an ever growing risk and they increase the chances of a costly miscalculation. That Pyongyang just took Trump's most recent threat to eliminate it as ""declaration of war"" may well show its existential concerns: It is unlikely it will make good on its threat to shoot down US bombers flying in international airspace, unless they threaten its survival.  Reason dictates that despite all the saber-rattling and verbal abuse, every party is well aware that war has to be avoided as the costs would be too great to bear.  The latest UN sanctions need time to begin to bite. On Thursday, China announced it has ordered DPRK enterprises operating on its soil to close within 120 days.  But to ensure that the worst-case outcome does not materialize, while further coordinating their stances on the implementation of the UN sanctions to make sure they work, Beijing and Washington also need to discuss what else they can do to resolve the peninsula crisis peacefully.

[Photo/Xinhua]      United States President Donald Trump, in his maiden speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, was less forthcoming in his praise for the world body than his predecessor Barack Obama, indicating the US under his administration will pursue an all-for-itself approach that runs counter to the cooperative spirit of the world's foremost multilateral platform.  Trump was right that nations cannot remain bystanders given the common threats and challenges the world faces today, but cooperation cannot be shared self-interest, since for his administration that means a shared commitment to what is in the short-term interests of the US, rather than what is in the best long-term interests of all countries.  The pressing challenges the world faces today are not as the US misperceives threats to its hegemony, but rather poverty, epidemics, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and climate change.  What is needed is improved global governance, and the UN should be strengthened so that it can better fulfill its intended role in leading global efforts to address regional and international crises. Finger-pointing such as that indulged in by Trump will not help either of these processes and will only allow crises to ferment dangerously for an even longer time.  Trump called ""rogue nations"" the ""scourge of our planet"" and called on the UN to further isolate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But today's dangerous deadlock has been the result of Pyongyang's and Washington's persistent pursuit of their own interests in disregard of other countries' efforts to persuade the two antagonists to talk. His threat to ""totally destroy"" the DPRK if need be will, therefore, likely worsen the already volatile situation.  More needs to be done to improve the working style of the UN so that it can emerge from the shackles of bureaucracy and low efficiency, and better live up to its role as the defender of world peace and stability and the coordinator of nation-to-nation relations.  And in this time of ""immense promise and great peril"", Trump would have been better reflecting on how the US can more constructively engage with other countries, not just those that are willing to follow its lead. After all, since taking office in January, Trump has only exacerbated the confusion and uncertainty worldwide with his steady stream of contradictory tweets.  And he has withdrawn, or sought to pull out of, multilateral deals his country has signed before. From the Paris climate accord to the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump has demonstrated he is totally unconcerned about the US being good to its word.  Trump should accept that with great power comes great responsibility, and that as the world's sole superpower, the US has the responsibility to work with the rest of the world for the common good. History will show whether it is up to the task.         "

UN Security Council on Monday imposed new sanctions on the DPRK over its latest nuclear test. [Photo/Xinhua]      Every time the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducts a nuclear test or missile launch, it is followed by a chorus of condemnation and a package of UN sanctions. Then everything goes back to ""normal"", with Pyongyang and Washington continuing their brinkmanship and the rest of the world helplessly looking on.  To ensure a peaceful Korean Peninsula that vicious circle must come to an end.  The UN Security Council has issued another strongly worded condemnation following Pyongyang's missile launch on Friday. But such rhetoric never works with the DPRK, whose leadership is seeking an ""equilibrium of real force with the US""-that being to its mind nuclear deterrence.  So the question being asked now is: Will sanctions make a difference?  If sanctions failed to prevent Pyongyang from conducting what it claims was a hydrogen bomb test on September 3, and launching a ballistic missile on Friday, will the latest sanctions bring the leaders in Pyongyang to their senses?  Some have simply accepted they will not, and are either calling for military action or else saying it is time the rest of the world began to learn to co-exist with a nuclear-armed DPRK. But the latter requires the international community forsake its current commitment to denuclearization and accommodate a provocative Pyongyang as a legitimate nuclear power, which looks anything but realistic.  In its latest statement, the UN Security Council displayed the unanimous belief that Pyongyang's nuclear/missile stunts are a threat to regional and global security. Beijing, through its ambassador to the US, stated hours after the missile launch on Friday that China would not accept the DPRK as a legitimate nuclear power.  Considering the unaffordable collateral damage of any military action against the DPRK, as well as the impossibility of dialogue at the moment-especially since Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in, who favored engaging Pyongyang, has found dialogue ""impossible""-the most feasible approach is to let sanctions do the trick.  With its Friday missile launch, Pyongyang wanted to give the impression that sanctions will not work. Some people have fallen for that and immediately echoed the suggestion, pointing to the failure of past sanctions to achieve their purpose.  But that past sanctions did not work does not mean they will not. It is too early to claim failure because the latest sanctions have hardly begun to take effect. Giving the sanctions time to bite is the best way to make Pyongyang reconsider.  Priority No 1, therefore, is for the international community to work in unison so that the UN sanctions are implemented in full and work as intended, while leaving the door open to talks.         "

KCNA via Agencies    The United Nations Security Council's unanimous decision on Monday to impose a new round of, and tougher, sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the international community's unswerving resolve to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program, and protect the nuclear non-proliferation regime.    By cutting the DPRK's overall oil supply by about 30 percent, banning all textile exports and prohibiting all countries from authorizing new work permits for the country's workers, the sanctions will certainly deal a blow to two key sources of finance for Pyongyang and may somewhat jolt its nuclear and missile program. But whether or not they will make the DPRK abandon its nuclear program is open to question.  That before the UN vote the DPRK declared the United States would face ""pain and suffering"", as it would retaliate if any new sanctions were imposed should reflect the Pyongyang's determination to press ahead with its ambitious and contentious nuclear program despite intense international pressure. Perhaps this is where the UN resolution, if taken in its entirety, can help, for it also calls for seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue through diplomatic and political means, taking measures to defuse tensions on the peninsula and making efforts to resume the Six-Party Talks.  If such efforts are indeed made, the DPRK is more likely to abide by the Security Council's resolutions, halt, if not abandon, its nuclear/missile program and return to the negotiation table.  The UN must have realized by now that sanctions alone cannot force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. The key to peace on the peninsula lies in making Pyongyang see the benefits of voluntarily giving up its nuclear program. But to bring Pyongyang even close to that point, the international community has to give some assurances, assurances it will honor: that the DPRK's national security will not be threatened by any country and its urgent development needs will be met.  China threw its weight behind the Security Council because it agrees that measures should be taken against Pyongyang in response to its sixth and strongest nuclear test on Sept 3. And given its support to international efforts to denuclearize the peninsula and safeguard peace and stability in the region, China has called for the comprehensive implementation of the UN resolution.  That Pyongyang should immediately stop its nuclear and missile tests and the opposing parties refrain from making any more provocative moves goes without saying. In the end, however, the DPRK can be convinced of the benefits of abandoning its nuclear pursuit only through talks, not threats and sanctions. And once the international community accepts this fact, it may find the road to peaceful negotiations a lot smoother.                  "
"Merkel's offer a ray of hope","

          ","                              German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland February 7, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    Today even the most sanguine geopolitical analyst would have to concede the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis has reached the most critical, if not the most dangerous, stage. Despite years of international efforts to put a brake on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambitious nuclear program-through the Six-Party Talks or the many rounds of sanctions imposed by the United Nations and some countries-the country's nuclear and missile program seems close to completion.    Given these facts, new ideas and the involvement of new parties are needed to resolve the Korean Peninsula crisis.  It is thus welcome news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is ready to play a diplomatic mediator's role to help break the peninsula deadlock. In an interview with a German newspaper, published on Sunday, Merkel said: ""If our participation in talks is wanted, I will say yes immediately."" Merkel referred to the negotiations that led to Iran curtailing its nuclear program as a ""possible format"" for resolving the DPRK nuclear issue.  A week earlier Switzerland had offered to mediate between the rival parties, and on Friday China asked France to play a ""constructive role"" in helping ease the situation on the peninsula.  Merkel's suggestion echoes the rational voices in the international community that the DPRK nuclear issue should be resolved through peaceful consultations, and that war should never be an option. But for her ""format"" to work, Pyongyang and Washington, the two sides directly involved in the conflict, have to make some compromises.  Neither side has shown any signs of budging from its rigid stance, though. And the ""dual suspension"" proposed by China and Russiathe DPRK suspends its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the United States and the Republic of Korea suspending their joint military drills-seems to have fallen on deaf ears, and the vicious circle of rising tensions and increasing provocations continues.  But since Germany has no direct interest in the conflict, Merkel may be in a better position to help ease Pyongyang's existential worries, which have intensified due to the dramatic changes in the international situation after the end of the Cold War and decades of self-imposed isolation.  Although it is far too early to say whether Merkel's sedate diplomacy would help stabilize the Korean Peninsula, the efforts made by Germany, and other countries, in the pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the DPRK issue will help build mutual trust and reduce the chances of war. Any effort toward that goal is highly commendable.                  "

KCNA via Agencies    The message was clear. As President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Donald Trump on the phone on Wednesday, China remains ""unswervingly committed to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and preserving the international nuclear nonproliferation regime"".    The message was crucial, too, because it came at a time when the international community is racking its brain over how to respond to Pyongyang's latest, and most serious, nuclear provocation.  The last thing Beijing wants to see is a war-and the subsequent chaos and refugee exodus-which, besides raising security and humanitarian concerns, would exact an unbearable cost on China's Northeast, which is already struggling economically.  That Xi reiterated the belief that a long-term solution lies in dialogue and a ""comprehensive"" approach was only logical. And by highlighting Beijing's commitment to denuclearization and nonproliferation, Xi made it clear a nuclear-armed, saber-rattling Democratic People's Republic of Korea is as unacceptable as a war.  Since the almost unavoidable heavy civilian toll a military approach is widely believed to result in has made forcefully disarming Pyongyang a non-option, non-military means remains the only agreeable way to reason with the DPRK, and draw all the parties to the negotiation table.  China and Russia have proposed an ideal short-term tension-defusing solution: ""dual suspension"", meaning the United States and the Republic of Korea suspend their joint military drills in exchange for the DPRK halting its nuclear and missile adventure. The proposal is important because the concerned parties' deep-rooted mutual distrust, especially Pyongyang's belief in nuclear deterrence, could escalate tensions further leading to the catastrophic, yet avoidable, worstcase scenario-a military conflict.  Strong protests from Beijing and Moscow failed to stop Seoul and Washington from deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK. Four more launchers were installed in the wee hours of Thursday. Now, Seoul and Tokyo are considering introducing more powerful US ""strategic assets"", tactical nuclear weapons included. Should this pattern of escalation perpetuate, the resultant arms race in Northeast Asia could spiral out of control.  Of course, more efforts should be made to discourage Pyongyang from making fresh trouble. But, as China said on Thursday, while the United Nations should take more action against the DPRK, it should also push for dialogue, even the revival of the Six-Party Talks.  Perhaps the failure of even the severest sanctions to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program suggests something the world seems to have missed: until the DPRK is assured there is no threat to its security, it will continue its, at times desperate, attempts to possess nuclear weapons as deterrence against the US. So, if the Six-Party Talks is the means to a long-term solution to the peninsula crisis, addressing the DPRK's security concern could be the start of that process.               "

KCNA via Agencies    That a new, knottier round of crisis would break out after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sunday was immediately clear, as was the fact it would not end any time soon.    With the dust the nuclear test raised and the verbal volleys of reactions it invited yet to settle down, come reports of Pyongyang preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile, which, needless to say, would further raise the hackles of the United States and Japan, and make Northeast Asia's security yet more uncertain.  What the US thinks about the DPRK found expression in its ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley's remarks. The DPRK leader ""was begging for war"", she said on Monday while urging the UN Security Council to impose the strongest sanctions possible on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear program.  The same day, US President Donald Trump told ROK President Moon Jae-in on the telephone that he would support ""in principle"" Seoul fitting its missiles with heavier warheads as deterrence against Pyongyang, while the ROK said it would clear the installation of four more batteries of the Thermal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile.  Such threats of war are the last thing China wants, not least because a war would end its decades of efforts to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula in devastation, which would serve no parties' interest.  Unfortunately, the other stakeholders seem to feel otherwise, as neither the US nor the DPRK is ready to budge from its position. If this vicious circle of US threats and DPRK provocations continues, the situation one day is bound to reach a tipping point. And if either side exhausts its patience and uses even a conventional weapon, the consequences of what would follow would be catastrophic.  It may already be late but not too late to give negotiations, sincere and serious, another chance. All the stakeholders, except perhaps the DPRK, want to denuclearize the peninsula. And perhaps none, certainly not China, wants a war. Why can't then all the stakeholders use these two factors as key to begin, at least, informal talks?  The US is worried that the DPRK is inching closer to possessing nuclear weapons. But the DPRK has reached that point to counter the perceived threats, including those from the US, to its security. If Pyongyang gets a sincere assurance that its security is no longer threatened, it might, as in the past, see some reason for taking part in talks.  Sanctions have not deterred Pyongyang from its quest, nor have military threats. China has been right about their ineffectiveness, and is almost certainly right about the effectiveness of negotiations.               "

KCNA via Agencies    US President Donald Trump's reaction to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's sixth nuclear test on Sunday stood out-not for its condemnation but for its twisted approach. Trump took to Twitter to say the DPRK ""is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success"". In his second tweet, he said the Republic of Korea ""is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with"" the DPRK ""will not work, they only understand one thing"".    He then called an emergency meeting of his national security advisers and had his second telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But he did not talk to ROK President Moon Jaein, accusing the ROK of ""appeasement"".  Condemning the DPRK for its nuclear and missile adventure is justified, but Trump is not helping the situation by criticizing the ROK and China. And China has not succeeded in its efforts, because the US has never heeded its advice on how to resolve the DPRK issue.  After the DPRK fired a missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, Trump said, ""all options are on the table"", a euphemism for military action. But his former chief strategist Steve Bannon had told The American Prospect earlier that ""there's no military solution, forget it"". Even US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have talked about the likely catastrophic outcome of military action.  And Moon, reacting to Trump's threat to the DPRK, said: ""No one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without the ROK's agreement.""  Although Pyongyang's latest nuclear test poses a serious challenge to Moon's strategy of inter-Korea dialogue, reconciliation and cooperation, Trump should have realized before criticizing Moon for his ""appeasement"" that sanctions have a worse record than talks.  Asserting that sanctions don't work, Robert Gallucci, chief US negotiator with Pyongyang during the Bill Clinton administration, said that during his contacts with DPRK officials, he realized they were fully aware of the cases of Iraq and Libya, where the US pursued regime change even after those countries had abandoned their attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.  That is something the US should focus on to ease the tensions not only on the Korean Peninsula, but also between Washington and Pyongyang.         "

[Photo/Agencies]    Japan's Defense Ministry is seeking by far its highest budget for fiscal 2018 beginning next April, which, if approved, will be the sixth consecutive increase in the country's defense expenditure, reflecting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's penchant for military expansion. The proposed 2.5 percent hike will raise the budget to 5.26 trillion yen ($48 billion), which the ministry says is needed to pay for upgraded missile interceptors, six F-35 stealth fighters, four V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and new naval vessels, including a submarine and two compact warships.    A country constitutionally bound to maintain armed forces purely for defensive purposes certainly doesn't need such military equipment for national security, most of which anyway is provided by its military ally, the United States.  Yet Japan, under a bellicose Abe, has been setting one record after another not only in increasing military budgets but also in leading Japan on the dangerous path of militarism. Instead of sincerely reflecting upon Japan's wartime past and atoning for the atrocities the Japanese army committed before and during World War II, Abe has made every effort to revise Japan's pacifist Constitution, so that he can build a strong military.  To justify Abe's military expansion plans, many Japanese media outlets have accused China of posing a threat to Japan. They have used Japan's maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea as an excuse for the hikes in Japan's defense budgets, disregarding the fact that Tokyo was solely responsible for escalating the dispute.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, is high on Japan's blame list, and by test-firing a missile over Japan on Tuesday, Pyongyang seems to have played into the hands of Tokyo. The DPRK deserves the strongest condemnation for its provocative action, but it remains unclear as to how great a threat it poses to Japan. More importantly, countering a potential threat by building a bigger arsenal could lead to counterproductive and even dangerous outcomes, not only for Japan but also for the whole of Northeast Asia.  The current deadlock over the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue shows using military action as an option to resolve it will worsen and complicate the situation further. To salvage the situation, which seems to have reached a tipping point, the parties involved need to exercise strategic patience and establish communication.  But what Japan is doing, instead, could trigger an arms race, throwing the strategic equilibrium in the region off balance, setting alight the tinderbox that the peninsula has become.  Should such a scenario become reality, Japan will find the consequences of its military ambition almost impossible to swallow.               "

[Photo/Agencies]    Reactions to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's latest provocation have followed the age-old script:    Pyongyang insisted it was exercising its legitimate right to ""self-defense"" by firing a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday. For the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan in particular, it was an exceedingly provocative gesture not seen in almost a decade. So much so that Japan activated its J-Alert system in northern areas, conducted drills to test its anti-ballistic missile system PAC-3; ROK President Moon Jae-in personally ordered live fire drills to exhibit his country's ""overwhelming"" fire power, with an officer counter-threatening the DPRK leadership with ""extermination""; and US President Donald Trump repeated his previous warning that ""all options are on the table"".  Despite the widespread condemnations, from the United Nations, Japan, the ROK, the US, China, Russia and other countries, the DPRK appears defiant as ever, threatening to fire more missiles into the Pacific.  The story has been unfolding exactly the same way as on each past occasion, and the outcome seems set to be the same: Pyongyang and its critics continuing wrangling over the chicken or the egg causality dilemma, with the former refusing to give up its nuclear pursuit and the latter remaining hopelessly divided over what to do.  If Pyongyang's latest provocation has exposed the helplessness of the international coalition against its nuclear and missile programs, the worse may be yet to come.  One fundamental reason for the international community's inability to curb the DPRK's dangerous adventure has been the contradictory agendas of those that ostensibly have shared interest in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. If the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is the first wedge driving the fragile coalition apart, another, more damaging one seems on its way as Seoul and Washington reportedly engage in talks on deploying additional ""strategic assets"" on the ROK's soil. Seoul has already confirmed corresponding talks between ROK and US militaries.  Pyongyang's continuous provocations may serve as a catalyst for the potential deployment of additional but controversial and divisive ""strategic assets"". But like THAAD, US strategic weapons can do little to prevent the feared civilian losses when a war with the DPRK breaks out. However, they can seriously undermine the precious, though already weak, global consensus on the denuclearization of the peninsula, as combined with THAAD, they will constitute a potential, substantial threat to Chinese and Russian national security, and inevitably invite strong reactions from both.  When that day comes, Pyongyang's nuclear/missile programs may turn out to be of secondary concern to the world.               "

KCNA via Agencies    Just three days after the abortive launch of a number of unspecified projectiles, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fired what was believed to be a ballistic missile that flew over Japan on Tuesday morning, prompting an emergency phone call between Japanese and US leaders that ended with a vow to put more pressure on Pyongyang.    Whatever be its intended message, Pyongyang's latest provocation is in clear violation of United Nations resolutions, which could put it in a more difficult position.  It will not be easy to reason Pyongyang out of its nuclear and missile programs, especially because the DPRK, of late, has been reiterating it must press ahead with them at all costs. Divergences among stakeholding countries have given the DPRK ample breathing space to continue its nuclear/missile adventure. Pyongyang obviously believes that will not change.  But Pyongyang would commit a grave mistake by refusing to see that each of its new provocations is alienating it further from the international community. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions aimed at nullifying the DPRK's nuclear/missile adventure because it perceives in it a big threat. The latest, Resolution 2371, which imposes the harshest sanctions on the DPRK, indicates a higher level of consensus on that threat.  However, it would be unfair to dump all the blame on Pyongyang alone. Washington, Tokyo and Seoul each has its own fair share in creating what Pyongyang sees as a threat to its very existence.  Beijing has been consistent in calling for due respect for Pyongyang's security concerns, and for the US-Japan-ROK alliance to provoke the DPRK no further. It has rightly called for ""dual suspension""-Pyongyang suspends its nuclear/missile activities while Washington and Seoul suspend their large-scale military drills- to break the deadlock, which none of the three has responded to.  But Beijing's latest warning that tensions on the Korean Peninsula have reached ""tipping point"" should not be taken as one meant just for Washington and its allies-Pyongyang deserves no cover for continuing to throw cold water on the international community's efforts to denuclearize the peninsula.  Considering the longstanding, unchanged script of the protracted drama, the ""tipping point"" may not necessarily materialize any time soon. More likely than not, a short interval of relative ease will follow, until Pyongyang launches another ballistic missile, or conducts another nuclear test.  The international community may remain helpless while Pyongyang steadily strengthens its capabilities, but Pyongyang will find the screw of sanctions tightening- until the threat gets too real, too devastating to be tolerated, or the sanctions too severe to endure.

[Photo/Agencies]    ""If winter comes, can spring be far behind?""    For two centuries, that famous line by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley has offered numerous people in despair the hope that the dark hours will pass.  It may also have been on the mind of Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday, when he urged his country's Ministry of Unification to prepare for a thaw in relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Like the freezing chill of winter never halts the footsteps of spring, the more difficult the situation gets, the harder the ROK should try to ease tensions with the DPRK, Moon said. Placing the tense standoff on the Korean Peninsula in the dead of winter, Moon reiterated his belief that a thaw will eventually come.  Great statesmanship no doubt requires some clinging to idealism-the capability to retain and kindle the small flame of hope and to envisage a brighter prospect that lies beyond sight.  The ROK president obviously still has some, considering his undampened enthusiasm for engaging Pyongyang, and his conviction there will be a peaceful conclusion to the DPRK crisis.  Yet unlike the natural inevitability of the cycle of seasons, there is no certainty that bad will turn to good in real-world situations. Depending on the concerned parties' actions or inactions, the current stalemate could go either way.  Despite all the high-decibel threats of mutual destruction and actual saber-rattling, both sides have been careful not to shut the door to dialogue. Both keep signaling willingness to talk, although setting preconditions they know are unlikely to be met.  Perhaps President Moon has been reviewing the past to justify his hopes in a coming spring.  Following a DPRK missile test and suspected nuclear activities in 1998, US special envoy William Perry led a comprehensive process of regional consultation and coordination that once brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. And the joint statement made on 19 September 2005 following the second phase of the Six-Party Talks that year established a basic framework for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  But if those remarkable headways did not suffice to make a lasting difference, President Moon's good wishes hardly will. Moon's adherence to engagement is to be admired. But it will prove meaningless without the support of corresponding moves that truly de-escalate tensions.  While its joint military drills with the US continue irking Pyongyang, the ROK's deployment of the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is alienating other members of the international community trying to denuclearize the peninsula.  Should this pattern persist, the winter President Moon foretells ending may instead prove a long one.               "

          ","                             Protesters hold a rally against the deployment of the US missile defense system in Seoul on Saturday.Yao Qilin / Xinhua      Thursday marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea, an occasion that should have been observed with lots of fanfare and the extending of mutual best wishes.        That such high-profile celebrations are conspicuous by their absence can be attributed to the deployment of the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the ROK, which put a brake on the development of the hard-won strategic cooperative partnership, and then thrust it into reverse.  Despite Beijing's firm opposition to the ROK's deployment of THAAD given its potential damage to the regional strategic balance and China's security interests-as well as the doubts about the system's ability to achieve its stated purpose of defending the ROK should it come under attack from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-the recently installed ROK President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial missile defense system late last month after the DPRK's most recent missile test.  The move dashed the hopes which arose when he took office in May that he would postpone the system's deployment in the ROK pending an environmental review. It was anticipated that this would improve the deteriorating Sino-ROK relations, by giving the two neighbors time to sort out their differences and find a common approach to easing the growing tensions in the region.  For relations shouldn't be like this. In the face of the escalating brinkmanship between the US and the DPRK, Beijing and Seoul are both on the same page in wanting the Korean Peninsula to be nuclear free, and both believe war is not an option. Just last week, Moon said he was considering sending a special envoy to the DPRK for talks in a bid to jump-start diplomacy.  The ROK's security concerns are genuine, but they would be better addressed by not estranging China, and the two countries working closely together to promote peace and stability on the peninsula.  The ROK should not let its fears that it is in the DPRK's cross hairs betray its judgment. Hanging on to the coattails of the US, which has its own aims in the region, merely increases the likelihood of those fears coming true.  Twenty-five years ago, the leaders of China and the ROK, guided by their wisdom, and displaying courage and vision, beat all odds and decades of hostility to forge a friendly relationship that has benefited the two nations tremendously and contributed to peace, security and prosperity in the region.  Seoul should display similar wisdom and vision now.         "
"Trump asking too much from Beijing on peninsula issue","

          ","                              Sino-US trade / China Daily    US President Donald Trump will reportedly sign an executive memorandum on Monday authorizing the US trade representative to determine whether to investigate the allegedly ""unfair"" Chinese trade practices, which could pave the way for punitive tariffs on Chinese exports.    But it is of critical strategic significance that his administration demonstrates reason and avoids making a rash decision it will soon regret.  Given Trump's transactional approach to foreign affairs, it is impossible to look at the matter without taking into account his increasing disappointment at what he deems as China's failure to bring into line the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. His idea of exploiting trade as a bargaining chip in dealings with China dates back to the campaign trail.  But instead of advancing the United States' interests, politicizing trade will only acerbate the country's economic woes, and poison the overall China-US relationship.  Blaming China for ""unfair"" trade is unfair in the first place. The trade imbalance, regular fodder for China-bashing on Capitol Hill, is, to a great extent, self-inflicted, an outcome of the US' political restrictions on exports to China. Yet this essential aspect is conspicuously absent in the US' narrative. The list of US gains in trade with China can grow or shrink, depending on how trade issues are handled.  While Trump's prior identity as a businessman may explain his transactional propensity, the deal he seeks demands the impossible of Beijing.  It is unfair for him to consign the burden of dissuading Pyongyang on Beijing; likewise to accuse Beijing of doing ""little"" or ""nothing"".  East Asia expert and former US ambassador to the Republic of Korea Christopher Hill was correct in observing Trump should not ""outsource"" the US' own troubles to China.  As Chinese President Xi Jinping again told Trump on Saturday, Beijing also seeks denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It would not have voted in favor of the latest United Nations resolution against Pyongyang's missile/nuclear adventures if this was not the case. The only difference is, Beijing wants to break the circle of escalation.  By trying to incriminate Beijing as an accomplice in the DPRK's nuclear adventure and blame it for a failure that is essentially a failure of all stakeholders, Trump risks making the serious mistake of splitting up the international coalition that is the means to resolve the issue peacefully.  Hopefully Trump will find another path. Things will become even more difficult if Beijing and Washington are pitted against each other.               "

[Photo/Agencies]    First it was United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stating Washington's willingness to talk with Pyongyang, if the latter halts its missile stunts.    Then US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against making ""any more threats"" to his country, which he promised ""will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"".   Neither seems to have worked, though. Pyongyang's attitude, which Tillerson deems critical to the US engaging in dialogue, remains defiant.  Responding to Tillerson's offer, DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Manila that his country ""under no circumstances"" will put its nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles on the negotiating table. And on Wednesday, the Korean People's Army announced it is ""carefully examining"" an operational plan for ""enveloping fire"" around the US military bases at Guam with its newly-acquired missile capabilities.  The latest round of saber-rattling between Pyongyang and Washington is particularly ominous because, although both parties sent ""mixed messages"" and hinted at a degree of flexibility, both set impossible preconditions.   So while it is good that neither has slammed the door shut on potential talks, it looks increasingly like a ploy to sabotage that prospect.   Pyongyang has justified its plan for missile strikes on Guam with Washington's ""reckless military provocation"", while the latter has employed the same pretext for refusing dialogue. Over time, this mutual finger-pointing has pulled both into a spiral of escalating distrust and hostility, which is the biggest obstacle to resolving the crisis.  The US' approach to the standoff has been counterproductive because it has simply escalated the threat from Pyongyang's nuclear/missile programs.  While some of Pyongyang's claims of technological breakthroughs no doubt need to be taken with a grain of salt, it has been making steady progress despite the strict international scrutiny and sanctions.  And now, Pyongyang has intercontinental ballistic missiles and reportedly a miniaturized nuclear warhead. From this point on, the threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang cannot be taken lightly.   United Nations Resolution 2371, which authorizes additional, potentially damaging sanctions against the DPRK's military adventures, is a timely response, and it is widely anticipated they will finally bite. But sanctions alone may not easily bring Pyongyang to its senses and the Beijing-proposed ""dual suspension"" approach, a freeze on the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile tests in exchange for a cessation of the large-scale military drills conducted by the US and the Republic of Korea, fair as it is, needs a starting point.   While making sure the UN sanctions are fully, honestly implemented, stakeholders must also make meaningful endeavors to persuade the US and the DPRK to take a step back from the brink.                  "

They also expressed satisfaction over the framework for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and agreed to make joint efforts so that their negotiations on a code of behavior in the waters can be started within the year.  As a hard-won result achieved through the joint efforts of the two sides to reach an agreement, the document mirrors the shared commitment to build peace and stability in the waters demonstrated by China and the ASEAN countries recently.  It seems, however, that Vietnam almost put a spanner in the works by attempting to push its own agenda during the meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers.  According to media reports, Hanoi struck a less harmonious note by hypocritically trying to insert tough language criticizing China's island building in the South China Sea, something Vietnam did first, resulting in a delay to the issuing of their joint statement on Saturday.  But with none of the other ASEAN members being like-minded, Vietnam's proposed phrases were not included in the communiqué released on Sunday.  As one of the 10 members, Vietnam should well know that it is by emphasizing consensus that ASEAN has become a major force in promoting integration and maintaining peace and stability in the region. Vietnam's attempt to sow seeds of discord does a disservice to itself, the other members and the region.  Since last year, tensions in the South China Sea have been ratcheted down due to the dedicated efforts of China and ASEAN to resolve their differences through dialogue, and both sides have been seeking to expand and deepen their cooperation.  With the situation in the South China Sea having ""stabilized remarkably"", as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted on Sunday, Vietnam should look to the future and focus on the bigger picture.  By readjusting its approach and attitude, and sincerely joining hands with the other ASEAN members to consolidate the positive progress made in ASEAN-China ties over the past year, Vietnam can help raise China-ASEAN relations to a new level.  China and ASEAN celebrate the 15th anniversary of their strategic partnership next year. By strengthening the synergy of their development plans and focusing on the Asian values of reciprocity, solidarity and good neighborliness, they can lead the process of regional integration and fully demonstrate its value.                  "

          ","                      The United Nations' response to latest provocations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-its intercontinental ballistic missile launches on July 3 and 27-has been prompt, with the UN Security Council unanimously approving tough, new sanctions on Pyongyang.  UN resolution 2371, with the expected condemnation ""in the strongest terms"", bans coal and other exports from the DPRK totaling upwards of $1 billion, as well as new joint ventures with the DPRK and additional foreign investment in existing ones.  The sanctions will bite deep. A$1 billion cut in DPRK export revenues means Pyongyang will possibly lose one-third of what it earned last year.  But no matter how tough the sanctions are, on their own they will never be enough to achieve a lasting settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue. Nor will the use of force, as some are proposing, resolve the issue; indeed it will only make the situation worse.  What is needed is for all parties involved to come back to the negotiation table to hammer out a deal that can finally bring peace and stability to the potentially volatile region.  That is why the call in the UN resolution for the long-shelved Six-Party Talks to be restarted should be both lauded and supported by the international community.  Given what has happened in the previous talks involving the DPRK, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia, it would be naive to expect the talks once restarted to achieve anything substantial in a short period of time. But it should be borne in mind that it was amid previous dialogues among the six that progress was made on the issue, and it was only since the talks stopped that the situation has threatened to get out of hand.  For the resumption of the Six-Party Talks, China proposes that the DPRK suspend its nuclear and missile program and the United States its military drills, which is the most realistic and reasonable way to decrease tensions and pave the way for all parties to return to the negotiation table.  As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, sanctions are not the ultimate purpose but rather a means to bring all the parties concerned back to talks so they can realize the ultimate aim of resolving the peninsula issue for good.

It once again underscores the strong political will of China and the ASEAN countries to work together to maintain stability in the South China Sea and sustain the positive momentum they have established in their relations.  The drawing up of a framework outline for the proposed code of behavior designed to prevent clashes in the South China Sea has been a significant achievement. And as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out in Manila, the agreement on the framework has laid a solid foundation for substantive consultations on the Code of Conduct.   With their joint efforts to reach agreement, China and the members of ASEAN have also sent a strong message to the international community that they are fully capable of handling issues of common concern in the region without any interference from a third party.  For while China and ASEAN are looking to the future and seeking new prospects from working together for peace, stability, and prosperity, some countries outside the region seem intent on stirring up trouble and stoking tensions in the South China Sea.   This year, US President Donald Trump has continued the controversial practice of his predecessor and sent warships to the waters under the duplicitous pretext that such a show of force is to safeguard the freedom of navigation of commercial shipping.  The United States likes to accuse Beijing of trying to militarize the South China Sea, but it is the US and its close allies that are doing that: The United Kingdom being the latest to jump on the freedom of navigation bandwagon by proposing to send warships to the South China Sea next year.   If these outside forces really cared about freedom of navigation they would be supporting China and ASEAN’s efforts to promote peace and stability in the region rather than trying to undermine them.   To give substance to their words, they should join hands with China and ASEAN to safeguard and build on the hard-won positive momentum so that the South China Sea is a seaway for peace, friendship and cooperation.                  "

[Photo/Agencies]      As if to cover up their own helplessness on the issue, some countries have demonstrated a renewed penchant for pointing an accusing finger at China, alleging that China has not put enough pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to rein in its nuclear weapons program.  As well as provoking a new round of vehement criticism and condemnation from the international community, the test-launch of a second intercontinental ballistic missile by the DPRK on Friday prompted Washington to once again claim Beijing is not exercising the influence it has over Pyongyang.  US President Donald Trump tweeted after the launch that he was ""very disappointed"" with China and Beijing was doing ""nothing"" to curb Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Such accusations are unfair, as they are totally unfounded. China is doing all it can and employing whatever influence it has. It has consistently and fully implemented UN Security Council resolutions, and repeatedly urged the DPRK to respect the collective will of the international community and cease any activities that escalate tensions.  Trump's implication that Beijing is somehow at fault for the US' current unease is simply a reflection of what has been his administration's inaccurate assessment of the situation.  Which is why US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's latest remarks on the issue are so welcome; they suggest the US has adopted a more rational perspective.  At a US State Department briefing on Monday, Tillerson said the US does not blame China for the escalating tensions and the US is willing to sit down and negotiate with the DPRK over its nuclear weapons program in coordination with China.  Tillerson's remarks hopefully signal Washington has adopted a more pragmatic approach to the issue and it is willing to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang in a bid to break the current impasse.  No stakeholder can single-handedly resolve the Korean Peninsula issue. But instead of concerted efforts to defuse the volatile tensions on the peninsula, the finger-pointing has merely highlighted the growing divergences among stakeholders on how to resolve the issue, which has threatened to prompt reckless moves that would exacerbate the already fragile situation.  It is hoped the US will now make concrete moves to translate Tillerson's words into action, and the DPRK will demonstrate its own sincerity to de-escalating tensions.         "

The US House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill that will slap tougher sanctions on Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). [Photo/Xinhua]      The best scenario in pursuing denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula-all stakeholders jointly pursuing a peaceful resolution-appears increasingly distant and unachievable. Indeed, there are signs that the fragile solidarity that had appeared to have been forged recently has already crumbled, since the apportioning of blame has resurged after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea test-launched its second intercontinental ballistic missile in a month.  By all measures, Pyongyang's latest progress in intercontinental ballistic missile technology is bad for all parties concerned. Not only is it in clear violation of United Nations resolutions, but it also constitutes a greater threat to peace and stability in the region.  Pyongyang's right to develop nuclear capabilities aside, its constant saber-rattling cannot but be taken as a dangerous threat to all, including China, which feels threatened by the damage Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ambitions may inflict on its immediate neighborhood.  For that reason, although US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration at what he considers Beijing's failure to dissuade Pyongyang from its nuclear adventure, Beijing has every reason to feel unfairly burdened with a task that is obviously beyond it, especially as it has been working diligently to broker a peaceful resolution to the crisis.  Trump is wrong in his assumption that Beijing can single-handedly handle the matter. As Beijing has said, repeatedly, it does not have the kind of ""control"" over Pyongyang that the US president believes it does.  Nor will Beijing accept Trump's allegation that it has done nothing. From Beijing's perspective, it has significantly increased the pressure on Pyongyang by doing everything the strengthened UN sanctions regime requires of it.  The only thing that has proven to be true so far is no country can solve the DPRK problem by itself. The logical conclusion, therefore, is the stakeholders need to work more closely together in order to find a way to guarantee peace on the peninsula.  Unfortunately, Trump's threat to link the issue to trade and mount pressure on China show these two stakeholders are moving further apart rather than coming together.  This lack of unity is a formula for failure and may, instead of a peaceful resolution, lead to a worst-case scenario.         "

[Photo/Xinhua]      Things became so ugly between Beijing and Seoul during the last days of the Park Geun-hye presidency that every sign of warmth evaporated. All because of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system the United States and Republic of Korea militaries rushed into the country amid the political vacuum prior to the general election following Park's impeachment.  Now that the new administration in Seoul has displayed a change of approach to bilateral ties, as well as an awareness of the damaging potential of THAAD, a thaw may be around the corner.  On the heels of a fence-mending trip to Beijing by a ROK presidential envoy, it has been reported that Chinese travel agencies may soon restart ROK-bound group tours.  On Monday in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, responding to a media query, visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Seoul to take advantage of the positive interaction following the envoy's visit, and ""remove the thorn stuck in the throat of bilateral relations"".  There is no bigger thorn than THAAD choking the relationship. Its removal, however, will take a lot more than the porous pretext the previous administration employed for its deployment-that THAAD is indispensable for the ROK's national security.  To what extent the system would be able to defend Seoul from Pyongyang's missiles aside, two things are obvious: THAAD cannot protect Seoul from Pyongyang's overwhelming artillery firepower and it compromises Chinese security.  Deploying THAAD is a no-win decision. Its only proven effect thus far has been estranging Beijing from Seoul, which would otherwise have been able to collaborate well in dealing with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea based on a shared belief that sanctions and dialogue should be pursued simultaneously. Their lack of united efforts has allowed the latter to conduct two more successful missile tests in disregard of international protests and sanctions.  A peaceful resolution to the DPRK's nuclear program would do away with the most-feared threat to the ROK's security and make THAAD redundant. The only sensible way to achieve that is for Beijing and Seoul to coordinate, cooperate and show solidarity.  In so doing, they can end Pyongyang's hopes of exploiting and profiting from their estrangement, and convince Washington that their approach works.  Pyongyang has repeatedly taken advantage of the schisms to continue its nuclear/missile adventure. The impressive progress it has demonstrated through the latest tests is a grim reminder that Beijing and Seoul need unity and shared resolve to solve the Korean Peninsula issue through peaceful means.

[Photo/Agencies]      Almost all of a sudden, the apparently imminent danger of a military showdown on the Korean Peninsula seems to have evaporated into thin air.        A government delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea talked with American political experts in Oslo, Norway, on Monday through Tuesday.  Then on Wednesday, the freshly elected Moon Jae-in, who advocates engagement with Pyongyang, was sworn in as the new president of the Republic of Korea.  At least for now, a temporary relaxation in the once inflammable tensions in the area looks credible, thanks to such precious highlights in the bleak geopolitical landscape of Northeast Asia.  Even better, the region has a precious opportunity to heal some of its most damaging recent rifts.  Although Pyongyang keeps clamoring it will conduct its sixth nuclear test ""at any time"", and it is ready to enter a nuclear duel with the United States. Although Washington has distanced itself from the Oslo talks, and ruled out any change to its preoccupation with ""maximum pressures"" on the DPRK. And although it remains to be seen how far Moon can overcome the potential drags at home in Parliament, where his party lacks a majority, when he does reach out to the DPRK.  Given US President Donald Trump's recent indication of his willingness to meet DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, who knows whether or not the informal contact in Oslo will pave the way for more formal, direct engagement?  After all, the White House has left that door open; Pyongyang craves it; Beijing would welcome it; and it would certainly be in Seoul's interests. Coordination with Washington then will be Moon's foremost foreign policy challenge.  Since it is anticipated he will take a milder approach to the DPRK than his predecessor, he will have to first straighten things out with decision-makers in Washington, who until now have favored imposing further isolation and sanctions.  Moon's expressed disfavor toward the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is certainly conducive to his aspiration for repairing his country's strained ties with China. It is hoped that he has the ability to maneuver a meaningful change to the current impasse.  Yet if their shared interest in peacefully denuclearizing the peninsula does lead to constructive interaction among stakeholders, and the threat from across the 38th Parallel diminishes, Moon surely can make a stronger case for removing THAAD.  For if THAAD is meant solely and specifically to address escalating threats from the DPRK, why should it stay if such threats de-escalate?         "

Although the White House was quick to roll back, shifting the limelight onto the ""right circumstances"", which spokesperson Sean Spicer said ""are not there right now"", Trump's remark is in line with his new-found determination to find a resolution to the DPRK issue.        Although the once clear-and-present danger of military conflict no longer seems as imminent, with both Pyongyang and Washington demonstrating restraint. It has not disappeared, and the road to denuclearization remains long and tortuous.  Not just because the US and the DPRK remain trapped in a vicious circle. In response to the latest military drill conducted by the US and the Republic of Korea-during which two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers joined forces with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and nuclear-powered submarines-Pyongyang accused Washington of pushing the peninsula to the ""brink of nuclear war"" through ""reckless military provocation"". And we have had earfuls of that following each nuclear or missile test by Pyongyang.  But also because the inevitable toll of any military action on the ROK weighs heavily on all decision-makers, and makes it extremely difficult to justify using force. That may be why the White House has chosen to remain somewhat vague and refrained from drawing a redline, despite its desire to mount maximum pressure.  The most likely outcome, then, is the US and other stakeholders find themselves bogged down in protracted debate over a feasible way to translate their wishes for a peaceful solution into acceptable-to-all actions, while the DPRK continues with its brinkmanship while avoiding crossing what it perceives to be the US' bottom line.  As a result, the DPRK will likely advance its nuclear weapons goals, even accomplish them. That would mean Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe claiming justification for putting to rest his country's war-renouncing Constitution.  Abe has already managed to demolish legal constraints on ""collective self-defense"" without violating Article 9, and lifted the long-standing ban on weapons exports.  On Monday, he reiterated the need to revise the county's Constitution, citing tensions in the region. On the same day, Japan dispatched one of its largest warships to protect a US navy supply vessel.  To borrow a line from Trump, Pyongyang ""will have good missiles"", if the current stalemate persists.  Abe, on the other hand, can ride the waves of confrontation and see his dream come true, without contributing anything substantial to end the stalemate.         "

          ","                      Hours after a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear issue, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reportedly test-fired a ballistic missile on Saturday, which exploded after liftoff. Pyongyang's repeated testing of the international community's patience will lead to severe consequences that will increasingly be hard for it to swallow.  Its blatant violation of Security Council resolutions constitutes an act of open defiance to the international community's resolve to denuclearize the peninsula and points to the urgency of tackling both the symptoms and the root cause of the issue.  A vicious circle of provocation and retaliation has reigned in recent months, with Pyongyang pushing its nuclear and missile programs while the United States and the Republic of Korea resorting to massive military exercises and the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in the ROK.  As a result, the degree of distrust and enmity has reached the highest it's been in years between the contested parties on the peninsula. One miscalculation and one misstep would easily push the two sides, separated by the Demilitarized Zone, to the brink of war.  At this stage, both sides should exercise utmost restraint because a head-on clash, even if a limited one, would lead to a costly price that neither side could afford to pay. Before diplomatic means are exhausted, those who have a penchant of trumpeting war rhetoric are being neither responsible to themselves nor others.  Pyongyang should awaken from the fantasy that its pursuit of nuclear capabilities and a missile program will bring it peace and security, as it has left the world community little choices but to tighten nonmilitary measures to rein in its dangerous ambition.  The country should know it is playing a dangerous and counterproductive game of provocation, which can backfire and reduce the chance for diplomatic mediation. In fact, its constant and escalating provocations have eroded the patience of stakeholders on the peninsula to defuse tensions through peaceful means.  Meanwhile, the US and ROK also need to do their part, and stop military threats and deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which is the practical way to mitigate distrust and defuse tensions so as to create the conditions for communication and dialogue.  Yet, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out in the UN Security Council meeting, no matter what happens, we should never waiver in our commitment to the goal of denuclearization.  A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is the basic precondition for its long-term peace and stability, which caters to the interests of all parties as it is the only way to dispel reasonable concerns of all stakeholders, including DPRK and ROK, and this should be the right direction for all parties to strive for.

"THAAD only hinders efforts to denuclearize peninsula","

          ","                              File photo shows Seoungju residents chant slogans during a protest against the government's decision on deploying a US THAAD anti-missile defense unit in Seongju, in Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2016. The banner reads ""Desperately oppose deploying THAAD"". [Photo/Agencies]    The militaries of the United States and the Republic of Korea are accelerating installation of the controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system south of Seoul.    If, as US Pacific Command chief Harry Harris claimed, THAAD is expected to be operational ""in the coming days"", there is little chance of it being suspended because of protests from Beijing and Moscow, even though it comes at a time when Washington and its allies want them to commit more comprehensively and deeply to coordinated moves.  Although the official excuse has been Pyongyang's wayward stuntsmanship and the threat it poses, making THAAD a fait accompli and pre-empting any change of mind from the next administration in Seoul may be a more powerful driver behind the rush to get THAAD up and running in the ROK.  Of course, Beijing and Moscow have valid reasons to protest, because the advanced system upsets the regional strategic balance and its radar undermines Chinese and Russian security interests, even though both the US and the ROK claim otherwise.  And since the deployment of THAAD in the ROK is now seemingly done and dusted, China and Russia have no choice but to respond.  Yet, whatever form that takes, it will not be the end of the story, since the nascent coalition against Pyongyang's nuclear/missile program is likely to be collateral damage from the intransigence of Washington and Seoul.  Beijing and Moscow are in the same boat with Washington and its regional allies on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula thanks to a shared security interest. And in the White House's latest rhetoric on Korean Peninsula denuclearization, China and Russia are referred to as ""partners in the region"", indicating unprecedented eagerness for a united front.  Beijing, however, has been identified as crucial to dissuading the DPRK from continuing along the path it has chosen. So much so that Washington seems to believe that Beijing alone can make a dramatic difference.  Beijing, on its part, has been consistent in adherence to diplomacy and pursuing a nuclear-free peninsula with the united efforts of all stakeholders.  The push to make THAAD operational in the ROK, however, creates a serious distraction for Beijing, because it represents a new security threat to it, one it must now address as a matter of urgency.  Washington and Seoul claim Beijing is misreading the situation and overreacting, but that is because they are not willing to take Beijing's concerns seriously and have not looked at the matter from Beijing's perspective.  Seoul does not seem to care what this means in the long run. But THAAD threatens to permanently change the regional landscape and only adds new dynamics to a situation that was already complex and requiring of careful handling.               "
"Misjudgment of situation biggest risk to peninsula","

[Photo/Xinhua]    If the risks surrounding the Korean Peninsula were perceived to be dangerously high, it was because of the fear that anything could happen at any time in the tense standoff that had developed between Washington and Pyongyang.    But now that the Donald Trump administration has demonstrated impressive patience for diplomacy-despite its announcement of the end to an ""era of strategic patience""-and it is seeking closer engagement with peace-minded China on the matter, the risks would appear to have abated considerably.  However, the situation is still inflammable.  For as the sanctions imposed by the United Nations begin to bite deeper, the possibility that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea might become reckless out of desperation has never been higher.  Not just the immediate stakeholders, but the whole world is holding its breath on Tuesday, the 85th Anniversary of the Korean People's Army, waiting to see whether Pyongyang will conduct another nuclear test, or major missile launch.  Of course a nuclear test, or missile launch, would not constitute the ""full-out war"" Pyongyang has threatened. And, despite its constant threats, Pyongyang would not embark on such a suicidal course unless it was left with no choice.  In contrast to Pyongyang's war rhetoric, Washington appears very much in line with Beijing on pursuing a peaceful resolution, at least for now.  Beijing has remained constant in advocating no-war, no-chaos on the Korean Peninsula. In his latest phone conversation with Trump on Monday, President Xi Jinping once again stated that position, appealing for restraint at this crucial juncture.  Judging from their recent words and deeds, policymakers in Pyongyang have seriously misread the UN sanctions, which are aimed at its nuclear/missile provocations, not its system or leadership. They have unfairly misrepresented Beijing's role in the process, disregarding its preoccupation with peace, humanitarian concerns and non-interference in the DPRK's domestic affairs. And they have greatly underestimated the international community's-not just any individual stakeholder's-political will to denuclearize the peninsula.  They are at once perilously overestimating their own strength and underestimating the hazards they are brewing for themselves.  They need to reassess the situation so they do not make any misjudgments.  Likewise Washington should continue to exercise restraint and pursue a peaceful resolution to the issue.  There have already been enough shows of force and confrontation, it is time for Pyongyang and Washington to take a step back from their previous rhetoric and instead heed the voices of reason calling for peaceful denuclearization of the peninsula.

[Photo/Xinhua]    Even as US Vice-President Mike Pence reiterated the era of ""strategic patience"" is over. Even as Pyongyang pledges to conduct another nuclear test ""at any time"", and carry out missile tests on ""a weekly, monthly and yearly basis"". The most impressive progress so far regarding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear/missile threats is the United States' latest indication that it, too, prefers a peaceful solution.    China, Russia and the US finally seem to have reached a consensus on the proper approach to a common headache.  Their shared concern brought the three together to endorse the condemnations and sanctions of the United Nations. Divergences in their approaches, however, left loopholes that have undermined the effectiveness of the sanctions.  Whether because of restraint or inability, that the usually provocative Pyongyang did not conduct an anticipated nuclear test last weekend has been followed by considerable easing in the tense standoff once broadly seen as nearing breaking point.  The relative calm that now exists offers a precious window of opportunity for stakeholders serious about perpetuating it. It will not last long.  It is hard to imagine that Pyongyang will forsake its nuclear pursuit, because that is the only leverage, or bargaining chip, it has.  Pyongyang may soon fire another missile, even detonate another nuclear device, if it sees no immediate threat. It can't afford extreme tensions, but neither can it live without them.  The constant growth of the DPRK nuclear threat testifies to the need for solidarity among key stakeholders, China, Russia, the US and Republic of Korea in particular. Their failure to get Pyongyang to toe the line originates in large part from their inability to speak in one voice.  The continuous difficulty in maneuvering major-power unanimity on the wording of a new UN condemnation at the Security Council is indicative of the diverse concerns setting them apart.  Now that even the once tough-talking Donald Trump is onboard for a peaceful solution, and all parties except Pyongyang want a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, the prospect has never been so bright for dissuading Pyongyang without the use of force.  Beijing has demonstrated due enthusiasm for Washington's newfound interest in a diplomatic solution and willingness to work more closely with it. But as the evolution of the state of affairs on the peninsula has shown, no party can fulfill the mission single-handedly.  Washington must be aware of the limitations to Beijing's abilities, and refrain from assuming that the matter can be consigned entirely to Beijing alone.               "

[Photo/Xinhua]      If ordering the missile strike on Syrian targets, dropping the ""mother of all bombs"" in Afghanistan, and assembling a war-ready armada off the Korean Peninsula were all meant to convey Donald Trump's message that things are different with him in the White House, what happened Saturday might well be Kim Jong-un's way of saying ""message received"".  Either because it chose to resort to a less provocative form of show of defiance, or it is technically not ready, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not carry out the widely anticipated sixth nuclear test. Instead, it launched another projectile, type unidentified, which failed.  Given the DPRK leader's pledge of ""ultra-toughness"" in response to the US' ""toughness"", he had to simultaneously avoid being seen as softening under US pressure and crossing the perceived US redline-conducting a new nuclear test. Firing a missile of some sort was thus a calculated move, and making it without prompting a furious response from Washington surely qualifies as a win to some degree from Kim's perspective.  Trump, too, can claim a win. That the nuclear test did not happen will surely be seen as the pressure working.  That Pyongyang kept tensions from reaching a dramatic climax can in some way be understood as a win for all parties concerned. At least they did not have to make the difficult decisions they would have had to if things had gone the other way.  The best part about the latest bout of Trump-Kim exchanges is both finally demonstrated rare restraint. The Trump administration has not excluded ""engagement"", though the current focus reportedly remains ""maximum pressure"". And Pyongyang's restoration of its foreign affairs committee was hardly coincidence.  That affirms the judgment that war, as imminent as it looked, is not unavoidable.  Neither the DPRK nor the United States wants war, at least not at this point, nor do the Republic of Korea, China and other stakeholders.  But it would be dangerous miscalculation if Pyongyang takes advantage of the relative easing in tensions and presses ahead with its brinkmanship, as it has done over the years. Washington's reported willingness to engage is conditional. And there is a strong, shared political will to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.  Washington did say it does not seek regime change. But that does not mean Pyongyang can indefinitely prolong its development of nuclear weapons.  There is a pressing need to de-escalate tensions and create conditions for diplomatic engagement, even if that is not immediate denuclearization talks.               "
