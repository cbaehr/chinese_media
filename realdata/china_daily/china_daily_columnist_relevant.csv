Not the right time for EU to fall for US trade sop,8/14/2018,"                      The surprising announcement of US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July that they intend to establish a zero-tariff trade regime has left many in China worried that the new trade partnership developing across the Atlantic could end up targeting China. Given the intensifying Sino-US tariff war, such concerns would only increase, especially because two senior trade officials from Brussels are scheduled to visit Washington on Aug 20 (unusually sacrificing their summer break) to discuss how the two sides can work toward zero tariffs, and zero subsidies for non-auto industrial goods. But if the new trade alliance Washington and Brussels are trying to work out is not targeted at China, and instead merely aimed at renewing their free trade and investment negotiations, which hit a roadblock after Trump took office in January 2017, there is no reason for Chinese people to be worried. In fact, Brussels has denied the new transatlantic trade partnership is targeted at China. At a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi early this month, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the European Union has no intention to adopt any policy or take any action against China. Instead, the EU stands with China in supporting multilateralism and free trade, and regards China as a major and key strategic partner. But since the EU played a pioneering role in shaping the current global governance regime, it must uphold international justice, not follow the rule breakers, at a time when globalization is under attack from protectionist forces. The atmosphere is not conducive to EU officials discussing a zero-tariff trade regime with their US counterparts, especially because the United States has imposed high tariffs on imports from the EU and other economies, especially China that openly opposes protectionism and unilateralism, and strongly supports free trade. True, the World Trade Organization framework allows bilateral talks on free trade and investment facilitation. But the EU officials should have realized this is not the right time to start such negotiations. Equally important, the EU should have involved the member countries, especially the two largest EU economies France and Germany, in the negotiations with the US. Since the 28 member countries of the EU are in different stages of economic development, the bloc as a whole needs the market, complete with its rules, for sustainable development. In manufacturing, for example, France is not as competitive as Germany. And many Central and Eastern European countries, which are still undergoing industrialization, could suffer a heavy blow, in terms of jobs opportunities for example, if US industrial goods were imported by the EU without any tariffs. That is precisely why French President Emmanuel Macron has been reluctant to accept the US-EU statement after the Trump-Juncker meeting. Moreover, even if the US-EU trade and investment talks enter the final stage, the legislative bodies of the EU and its member states may find it difficult to approve the Trump-Juncker proposal. Seemingly, zero tariff and zero non-tariff barrier are beautiful terms for politicians to gain public support. But the average tariff level between the US and the EU is already as low as 3 percent, so the two sides' efforts should only be aimed at lifting non-tariff barriers. The fact that transatlantic trade is mostly about competing against each other, achieving complementarity is difficult. For example, it is unlikely that the EU member states would purchase Boeing aircraft in bulk, and the US airlines would place big orders for Airbus planes. But the US could sell Boeing aircraft and the EU Airbus planes in bulk if they do business with China. The decision is theirs, but they would decide to deepen trade ties with China only if they truly believe in free trade.

Spark the G20 spirit to stop US destroying WTO,7/17/2018,"                          The World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters are seen in Geneva on April 12. [Photo/VCG]   With the global economy being dangerously-threatened and even damaged by unilateralism and trade bullying, the Monday meeting between China and European Union leaders went beyond the bilateral sphere and injected timely impetus into China-EU ties to save the global multilateral trading system from being destroyed by the unilateralism of the United States.  Both China and the EU, which have benefited hugely from free trade and market liberalization for decades, have pledged to take the lead in speeding up reform of the World Trade Organization, the leading global governance regime set up in the aftermath of the World War II, along with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.  Having evolved from GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) reached in 1947, the WTO was born in 1995 and as of now it has 164 members, which produce 98 percent of global trade flows. But this rule-based institution has faced tremendous challenges mainly because the US has unilaterally raised tariffs on the imports from its major trade partners, including China-which entered into the WTO in 2001-the European Union and Japan. The US has even escalated trade tensions with China by warning it will soon impose high tariff on almost half of the imports from China.  And within the WTO, the dispute settlement mechanism, one of the core pillars of the multilateral trading system, has come to a standstill because the US has long blocked the efforts to appoint new judges for the organization's appellate body.  It is normal for the 164 members to have differences but the most important thing is to have such a mechanism as the WTO to stand between complainants and respondents. But now, due to absence of judges, the US has basically made the WTO's dispute settlement body unworkable.  At the same time, with some negotiations such on as e-commerce still going on, the negotiations on rule changes within the WTO have basically slowed down. While, on the other hand, bilateral free trade and regional trade and investment talks have emerged, which is also a challenge that the WTO must face and accommodate.  The joint pledges by China, the world's biggest trading economy, and the EU, a 28-member bloc basically integrated through zero tariffs, to forge a working group to deepen WTO reform are encouraging, as the EU needs quick initiatives and actions to defend it from the attack of the Donald Trump administration.  The Trump administration has already withdrawn the US from several multilateral agreements-on climate change, the Iran nuclear crisis and UNESCO. And it is now challenging the WTO trade system.  So the WTO members must consider that scenario and try to convince the US to return to the negotiation table and multilateral regimes of global governance.  Meanwhile, China and the EU can use the platform of G20, which has already become an effective platform for both rich and emerging economies to coordinate their stances. China and the EU can set an example by standing together to oppose the US' actions and leverage that to convince other major economies to stand together to oppose the unilateralism of the US.  Ten years ago, when the G20 summit mechanism was established amid the economic ravages of the 2008-09 financial crisis, such a coordinating, cooperative and comprising spirit was evident and played an irreplaceable role in limiting the effects of the crisis. Now, it is time to press the emergency button, carry forward that spirit, and take such cooling-down actions again in the global village.

It's time the EU realized US' anti-free trade characteristics,7/10/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return from Bedminster, New Jersey, to Washington, July 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   European Council President Donald Tusk's weekly agenda shows he will discuss only routine affairs with US President Donald Trump at the NATO summit in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday. And there are no signs yet to suggest the European Union and the Trump administration will hold their first summit in the near future.  The reason for Trump's reluctance to hold a US-EU summit could be attributed to his discomfort with the idea of European integration. He even urged France recently to leave the bloc.  Although EU leaders expected a EU-US summit to be held at the earliest given the importance of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, Trump didn't show any inclination to do so. Now, even the EU is not pushing forward the TTIP agenda.  Trump visited Brussels in May 2017 but just held a short meeting with top European leaders on the sidelines of the NATO summit. And although he will visit Brussels for the two-day NATO summit again this week, no separate meeting with the EU leaders is scheduled, at least so far. Perhaps because their meeting at the G7 summit in Canada last month was anything but successful, they don't want to go through the same experience again.  But in protocol terms, this is unusual.  The EU boasts 500 million consumers and its collective economic clout is greater than that of the United States. Traditionally, theirs has been the closest partnership in the world; more importantly, such a meeting is necessary when the US president is visiting the EU headquarters.  During my almost eight-year stay in Brussels, it was usual protocol practice for EU leaders to hold meetings with visiting leaders, but Trump has bypassed that practice.  Hopefully, the US and EU officials are comparing last-minute notes to hold a US-EU meeting in Brussels.  Trump will also pay a four-day visit to the United Kingdom, which is busy negotiating Brexit terms with the EU, although Britons are protesting against the US administration. Apparently, Trump will discuss a free trade agreement with UK leaders, even though the UK is forbidden to do so until it leaves the EU.  Trump may be sending a message to the EU that he is playing a balancing game by giving the EU short shrift and attaching importance to the UK. The cooling of relations between the EU and the US is also a setback for global governance.  Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the G20 summits of advanced economies and emerging powers pushed forward global crisis-management measures to reform the global governance mechanism, with the major global players speaking in the same voice on climate change and other burning issues such as the Iran nuclear deal.  Despite the ups and downs, the international community managed to uphold rather fruitful dialogues and agreed to take concerted actions to meet global challenges. And China, the EU, the Barack Obama administration and other major players fulfilled their due roles.  But all that changed after Trump became US president.  Therefore, it's time the EU realized the Trump administration is out to neutralize the results of those joint efforts, by pushing its ""America first"" policy. The EU has always urged China to shoulder more global responsibilities, which the latter has done. And President Xi Jinping has reiterated that China has benefited from reform and opening-up, and thus will protect globalization and free trade.  China has been fighting protectionism and unilateralism not only for its own sake but also to protect the legacy of global governance, which is also in the interests of the EU and the US. So the EU must also fulfill its responsibility of safeguarding the assets and legacy of global governance in fields such as free trade, climate change, healthcare and education.  And to do that successfully, the EU must know which economy represents fairness in trade and which opposes it by launching trade wars.

Nation looks to capitalize on year of vital anniversaries,7/3/2018,"                      The first six months of this year have been distressful for the world with the Donald Trump administration hellbent on instigating a trade war, especially against China, and destroying the multilateral trading system.  In contrast to the United States' measures, which are isolating it from the international community, other important economies such as China and the European Union have been making sincere efforts to save the global trading system from being subverted by protectionist forces.  The next six months would be critical for the global economy, and economies across the world have to make concerted efforts to neutralize the negative forces, led by the US. Global leaders have to infuse positive energy into world trade, by exchanging ideas and making coordinated moves to reach a consensus on how to not only manage international relations but also make it fairer.  In the next six months, the world will have several occasions to reflect on the triumphs and failures of international relations and the positive role China has been playing to safeguard the world order. For example, in November, Europe will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I (1914-18), which prompted the world to think about building a fair international order.  In September, the world should reflect on what went wrong 10 years ago with Lehman Brothers, whose collapse triggered the global financial crisis, and draw lessons from the failings of Wall Street.  And in December, the leading advanced and emerging economies will hold the G20 Summit in Argentina, the first in Latin America. One hopes they discuss why the global leaders initially didn't take the global financial crisis seriously and reached a consensus to oppose trade protectionism in all its forms. Had they done that, the world would not be in a political and economic mess that we see it in today.  For China, this year marks quite a few important anniversaries.  Aug 8 will mark the 10th anniversary of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games, which provided China with a chance to present its achievements in different spheres to the international community and show it is working as a catalyst to unite the world.  In September and October in 2013, President Xi Jinping delivered two famous speeches during his visits to Asian countries, which signaled the birth of the Belt and Road Initiative that is now acting as an umbrella of China's diplomacy. The goals of promoting peace and prosperity by achieving mutually beneficial results have since become an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which can be seen as an intellectual contribution of China to the world.  But the most cherished landmark for China is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. The Chinese people are celebrating the anniversary because reform and opening-up have helped them to shake off poverty, land decent jobs and continuously increase their incomes. They have former leader Deng Xiaoping's vision, wisdom and pragmatism to thank for that.  The Chinese are dreaming of a much better future as China's per capita GDP of close to $9,000 shows the country is on way to becoming a truly modern economy by the middle of this century. In fact, Xi has unveiled a blueprint that projects China will become a great, modern socialist country by 2050.  But to achieve the goal, China needs a favorable external atmosphere, as interdependence is integral to globalization.  So, when Chinese leaders meet their counterparts at the BRICS Summit later this month, African leaders in September, and Asian and European leaders in October, and the world's top leaders at the APEC and G20 meetings, they will emphasize that China remains committed to promoting globalization and the multilateral trading system.  Hopefully, after six months, Sino-US trade tensions will disappear and China will be closer to achieving its goals.  The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.         "
"China, EU can work together to help others",6/26/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   With US President Donald Trump intensifying his attacks on globalization and free trade, the European Union has decided to expand its presence and influence on the global stage by largely increasing its ""external action"" budget. The European Commission has proposed to increase the external action budget to 123 billion euros ($143.34 billion) for the 2021-27 period compared with 94.5 billion euros for 2014-2020. The 30 percent hike in the ""external action"" budget is encouraging given the EC's slow growth.  That proposal, however, needs the approval of the European Parliament before it can be implemented.  The EU's efforts are in tandem with China's growing determination to boost international cooperation and development. Even though its per capita GDP is far lower than that of the EU, China set up its own international development and cooperation agency earlier this year in this round of institutional reform.  The two moves across the Eurasian continent come as calming signals at a time when unprecedented isolationism, unilateralism and rivalry between economies are threatening to destroy the established norms, rules and partnerships of the international system. But such actions need to be properly coordinated to maximize the benefits, particularly for those in need across the world.  The EU comprises many of the world's wealthiest economies with a stable political atmosphere. Apart from having huge experience in implementing international development projects, the EU also has the most advanced innovation policy, green and high-tech expertise, welfare and education systems, and social networking.  On the other hand, China's five-year economic and social plans' focus on poverty alleviation, its experiences in urbanization and development, even its firewall to prevent external financial intervention are important lessons for other countries.  China has vowed to eliminate absolute poverty by 2020. During its four decades of reform and opening-up, and gradual transformation from planned to market economy, China has signed dozens of free trade agreements with other countries which have been beneficial to not only China but also the rest of the world.  So, if China and the EU put those achievements on the same page, the list of beneficiaries will be surprisingly longer than imagined.  Of course, China and the EU have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to their ""external action"" agenda. For example, the EU focuses on selling its own political objectives and values. But political intervention has no place in international development and cooperation, and there are many unsuccessful cases which prove the point.  In contrast, China has no such agenda because it is convinced the people of every country have the right to choose their own development path. External actions, advices and even models can be used as references, but definitely not as preconditions. And political intervention should never be part of any international or cooperation project.  These are some of the areas in which the EU and China can cooperate and hopefully work together in, to make the world a better place. But their cooperation should go beyond the two-way level.  A European Union development institution has reportedly proposed to cooperate with China to spread the latter's experience, so that less-developed countries can learn from it to successfully develop economic and industrial parks and zones.  The proposal is interesting, as it would allow different economies to find out how China achieved unprecedented economic success.  This should give China and EU leaders, who are scheduled to hold their summit soon, some food for thought and prompt them to learn from each other's experiences and then design pilot programs for joint international development and cooperation.

"EU should judge the US by its actions, not reputation",6/20/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   Beijing and Brussels have been preparing for the annual China-European Union summit scheduled for July in Beijing, while the United States is turning its selfish unilateral policies into damaging and disruptive actions.  This is a reality Beijing and Brussels must face when approaching the summit and to build it into a sustainable and progressive platform. Of course, investment treaty, market penetration, increased flows of goods and people, and other issues should be listed on the agenda. But, as the leading drivers of globalization and multilateralism, the two sides must realize the changing global political and economic situations have already forced them to change their approach to the summit.  This means the China-EU summit must go beyond the mutual level to stabilize global governance at a time when the US is either withdrawing from multilateral pacts or disrupting the decades-old rules and consensuses established by the international community. In this sense, the summit looks to be historic and different from the previous ones.  However, this does not necessarily mean the rest of the international community should accept the US' disruptive policies. True, the US is the world's largest economy. But since the global supply and production chain has greatly contributed to the US' success, the entire international community should force the US to fulfill its international responsibilities.  So when Beijing and Brussels compare their notes for next month's summit, they should decide on what common actions to take in order to prevent Washington from turning the escalating trade tensions into war. Washington has already put Beijing and Brussels in the same boat, but what it has not realized is that the long global production chain, too, is in that boat.  It is necessary for Brussels and Beijing to warn Washington that it should withdraw its high punitive tariffs on exports from China and the EU for its own good. That the EU still has 28 members and 500 million consumers gives it a strong leverage to oppose the US' disruptive trade policies. And along with China's countermeasures against the US, the EU can use this leverage to force US decision-makers to change their anti-globalization and unilateral trade policies.  Considering the flip-flop nature of the Trump administration, Beijing and Brussels must establish long-term coordination to force Washington back on the track, and to behave like a responsible global leader.  China has been making concerted efforts to make the world a peaceful and prosperous place through cooperation, consensus and mutual trust, which shows it is a responsible global player.  After Xi Jinping became China's top leader in 2012, the overarching goal of China's diplomacy has been to forge a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, and to build a global community of shared future.  The EU is committed to globalization and a multilateral global system, and it is delving into the global problems so as to build a better world characterized by fair governance, with special focus on Eurasia. In many ways, the EU has been pursuing the same diplomatic goals as China, although on some occasions its interpretations and practices are different. This broad convergence of their goals should prompt the two sides to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership by removing ideological barriers, as President Xi said during his recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing.  China and the EU have long planned to become ""strategic partners"", but their efforts have been hampered by the lack of mutual trust. So Brussels must reflect why Beijing's relations with most of the EU members are better than the overall Beijing-Brussels ties.  It's time Brussels started acting not only as a regulator of relationships but also as a promoter, advocator and pioneer of healthy, constructive and visionary partnerships. It's also time the EU changed its approach toward the US to build sturdy and productive relations with other leading global players, including China.

Partnership between EU and US is no longer rosy,6/5/2018,"                      Is the United States still the ""closest partners, friends and allies"" of the European Union? The EU's mainstream media outlets and opinion leaders have been questioning the cross-Atlantic partnership after the US announced that starting on June 1 it would impose additional duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports from the EU amid the endless talks with the Donald Trump administration. The EU has vowed to take tit-for-tat measures while the bloc's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom termed May 31, when the US announced the decision, as a ""bad day"" for world trade. Malmstrom's reaction follows European Council President Donald Tusk's strong criticism of US President Trump's policy of dealing with an ally. In fact, last month Tusk said that Trump practices a policy of ""capricious assertiveness"". Tusk even pointed out that the EU should be grateful to Trump ""because thanks to him we have got rid of all illusions"". Public opinion within the EU has also been downbeat about the across-Atlantic relationship ever since Trump won the US presidential election in 2016 and entered the White House in January 2017. No wonder the summit between Donald Trump and European leaders in May 2017 was downgraded to a leaders' meeting, and it lasted just about one hour in Brussels. Trump has held many summits with global leaders, but no such summit has taken place between Washington and Brussels. But diplomacy is still diplomacy. On Friday, when European Commission Vice-President Federica Mogherini and China's State Councilor Wang Yi met journalists in Brussels after their strategic talks, Mogherini said it does not mean the US ""are not our closest partners and friends and allies, they remain such"" despite the rising trade tensions and Trump's decision to impose additional tariffs on EU imports. Mogherini refrained from saying the obvious perhaps because European leaders are scheduled to meet with Trump on Friday and Saturday at the G7 Summit in Canada's Charlevoix. It is possible she did not want to further worsen the situation and, instead, wanted to buy more time for both sides to settle their differences, control risks and shape a new consensus to stabilize their relations. It can be put this way: if EU leaders (including those from the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy) cannot reach a new consensus on trade, security and multilateralism with Trump, the outcomes of the G7 Summit will be very, very limited. And if they do reach an understanding in Charlevoix, the annual meeting among the world's most advanced economies could still offer public goods to the global economy, which faces rising trade disputes, financial hegemony, geopolitical threats, isolationism, populism and unilateralism. However, that would be expecting too much from Trump, and suppose that happens, it would be a miracle. Originally, the EU hoped to achieve an ambitious deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with the US when Barrack Obama was US president. After Trump succeeded Obama, the deal has been all but dead with no signs of resumption of negotiation. The TTIP deal was among the EC's 10 priorities for the 2014-19 period. But it seems it has been already scrapped. The Trump administration has dealt a heavy blow to multilateralism and the EU by pulling out of the hard-won Paris climate change agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as they reflected the EU's mediating capability on the global stage. Besides, by leaving the Paris-based UNESCO and challenging the role of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, the US administration has undermined the EU's efforts to make global governance truly multilateral and rule-based. The developments across the Atlantic over the past few months show the relationship between the US and the EU is not as close as before, and mutual mistrust is rapidly increasing. Otherwise, the two sides would not be dancing to different tunes on the global stage. The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau. fujing@chinadaily.com.cn         "
EU needs more partners to safeguard globalization,5/23/2018,"                      Given the uncertainties, concerns, mistrust and fears prevailing across the world, mainly because of the Trump administration's unstable foreign policy, politicians in the European Union may not be capable of protecting globalization, let alone promoting it. This fear was evident in the speech European Council President Donald Tusk made at the European Union-West Balkans Summit last week, in which he said some major global players were no longer the friends of the EU. But before elaborating on the cross-Atlantic partnership, Tusk said ""the rise of China"" and ""the aggressive stance of Russia"" were the EU's traditional political challenges. Such claims, rather beliefs, are baseless, but they could prompt EU politicians to keep other global players at arm's length in regional and international affairs. More important, Tusk said the United States administration and President Donald Trump practiced a policy of ""capricious assertiveness"". He was even quoted as saying that looking at the latest decisions of Trump, ""many could even think that 'with friends like that who needs enemies'."" Tusk went on to say that Europe should be grateful to Trump ""because thanks to him we have got rid of all illusions."" In all probability, this is the first time in the history of EU-US alliance that Brussels has criticized Washington using such strong language. Washington seems hell-bent on leading the world to nowhere, and Brussels is trying to stop it from doing so, while Beijing is urging Washington to correct its mistakes. For global players, however, strategic options matter more than the criticisms. What Tusk has essentially proposed is to ""unite"" the EU and ""act on our own"" to meet the challenge of the US. Shaping an EU consensus in dealing with global challenges and protecting globalization is critical. But that would not be enough. The EU should fulfill its responsibilities as one of the major global players, and the international community needs to take serious and immediate actions to protect free and fair global trade. China has already set an example in this regard by actively engaging regional powers such as India, Japan and the Republic of Korea in economic and strategic talks to promote globalization and free trade. This is not surprising, though, because China has always believed in making friends to contribute to global peace and prosperity. But the EU has not always been consistent in its partnerships with other global players. It has largely followed in the footsteps of the US until Trump became the US president last year. The EU should move beyond its own interests and act within a global framework of coordination and cooperation. The EU's recent strategy of dealing with China is different from the political consensus the two sides reached in 2014 to jointly pursue peace, growth, reform and civilization. Besides, the fact that some EU politicians still consider China a threat is groundless. In fact, apart from boosting common economic interdependency, China and the EU have worked together to fight climate change and finalize the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew the US recently. If the EU still sees China's rise as a challenge, its cooperation with China may not be as smooth as it should be. The bond across the Atlantic is still close despite Trump's miscalculation. The EU should make efforts on its part to strengthen it. A stronger cross-Atlantic alliance is also in the interests of China. The world is at a historically critical moment. Leaders, especially those of the major players, must shoulder their responsibilities as statesmen to avoid the escalation of tensions that would lead to a trade war and even conflict.

International community must prevent a trade war,4/10/2018,"                          Photo taken on April 7, 2018 shows a passage to the main venue for Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in Boao Town, South China's Hainan province. The Boao Forum for Asia annual conference will last from April 8 to April 11. [Photo/Xinhua]   The world will pay special attention to President Xi Jinping when he addresses his speech to almost 2,000 politicians, and business, media leaders and scholars from across the world at the annual Boao Forum for Asia in South China's Hainan province on Tuesday amid the escalating Beijing-Washington trade dispute.  Since US President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the world has been concerned about his governance strategies and tactics. In contrast, China has been acting as a responsible world power. Last year, China exhibited its goodwill when Xi met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago resort in the US state of Florida. That meeting was followed by Trump's state visit to China last November and the Xi-Trump meeting at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July.  But those high-level dialogues did not soften Trump's determination to ignite a trade war with China. Even the visits of Yang Jiechi and Liu He, both members of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, to the US to show China's sincerity in addressing the key issues of mutual concern through negotiation didn't have any effect on Trump.  Instead, Trump said on Thursday that he is considering additional tariffs on Chinese goods of $100 billion. This would be in addition to the tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods and those on Chinese steel and aluminum exports earlier. China has taken resolute countermeasures against US' unilateral move to safeguard its interests and the global trade system.Against this background, Xi will deliver his speech at the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia.  When he wrapped up his first visit to Western Europe as China's president in early 2014, Xi proposed that China and the European Union forge a partnership on peace, growth, reform and civilization while respecting diversity of cultures and traditions. He delivered another memorable speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January last year, urging the international community to adhere to free trade, globalization and multilateralism. This prompted former EU president Herman von Rompuy to label the two speeches as ""historic addresses"".  Xi's address at the Boao Forum on Tuesday is likely to become another historic speech, especially because amid the deteriorating global situation, Xi is expected to inject confidence and courage into the international community by announcing China's new reform and opening-up which will further boost global growth. China has already contributed almost 30 percent of the annual global economic growth during the last decade.  Xi's speech will most likely be a continuation of his message to the outside world-of closely integrating China with the world through closer win-win cooperation.  Over the past four decades, China has immensely benefited from open-door and free trade policies, while the rest of the world has also shared the benefits in equal measure. So it is expected that Xi's message to the world will again make it clear that China is a peace-loving country that abides by international rules. But it will also emphasize China is vehemently opposed to the rule of the jungle, as it advocates global justice and fairness. Xi may also warn the international community that it should not be complacent about the looming danger that the global economy could be dragged into another catastrophe if protectionism and isolationism, which Trump is promoting, gain the upper hand in world trade.  The recent dramatic fluctuations in global markets because of the US' trade protectionist measures are already showing upsetting signs. So the international community should take concerted action to prevent a full-fledged trade war between China and the US, because it could have a devastating impact on the global economy.

Of the states that do set a minimum age of criminal responsibility, North Carolina has the lowest at seven years old, while Wisconsin has the highest at ten years old.

Why doesn't US ditch zero-sum mentality in African development?,12/29/2018,"                      When US National Security Adviser John Bolton was laying out the new US strategy for Africa, which he announced on Dec 13, his primary concern was not about helping African countries with their economic and social development, but rather about countering China and Russia to advance the United States' selfish geopolitical goals.  Such a zero-sum mentality of a US politician came as no surprise. Former US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, and incumbent Vice-President Mike Pence have all labeled China's investment in, and trade with, Africa as ""predatory"" or ""debt trap"", or as tools of ""neocolonialism"".  Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, has endorsed Bolton's remarks. In a National Review article, titled ""The Coming Scramble in Africa"", Herman argues that China and Russia are ahead of the game to a degree, but the US has the advantage going forward. Like Bolton, Herman is neither a China expert nor an Africa expert, and therefore sees everything China does as bad and a threat to the US.  However skilled these people may be in waging a smear campaign against China, facts speak louder than words. Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is a leading authority in the field. And she gives China credit while pointing out its problems, unlike some pundits who only have a one-sided view: Everything China does is bad, and when bad things happen, it must be China's fault.  Brautigam recently told The East African, a Kenyan newspaper, that successive US policymakers ""have been spreading myths and rumors about what the Chinese are doing"" in Africa, as during her four-year in-depth study on China, she found ""no evidence at all"" to support the US government's depiction of China as a stealthy ""villain"" intent on ""sucking"" Africa's blood.  Contrary to the US charge, she argued that China does not typically give loans at high interest rates to African countries that it knows have little chance of repaying their debt. Rather, China varies its lending rates in accordance with its assessment of the African countries' repayment capabilities.  She noted that the US and other Western governments have also invested and lent to African governments with egregious record of repression and corruption. Warning against the Cold War mentality of US politicians, Brautigam said the Trump administration lacks the means to implement the ""Prosper Africa"" plan which Bolton boasted.  Compared with the US, which has long treated Africa as a continent that needs handouts, China, thanks to its experience of four decades of reform and opening-up, sees a promising future for Africa in helping lift people out of poverty and supporting it to achieve rapid economic and social development.  That's why China surpassed the US in trade with Africa in 2009. In fact, China's trade with Africa shot up to $170 billion in 2017, three times the US trade volume. Chinese companies have been building infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and power grids because Beijing knows infrastructure is essential to maintain as well as accelerate economic growth.  Bolton and some US pundits and media outlets have also alleged the People's Liberation Army logistics support base in Djibouti poses a threat to the nearby US military base. This claim is an example of sheer paranoia and beyond logic given the US' military might and its 800-plus military bases across the world.  At a seminar in Madrid last month, Chinese and European experts and former officials pointed to the huge potential China and European countries would have if they joined hands in third markets such as Africa and Latin America.  That's the sort of healthy and win-win mentality people like Bolton badly need to cultivate.  The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.          "
Phone call could be beginning of change in Sino-US ties,11/5/2018,"                      [Photo/VCG]   The phone talk between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on Thursday was probably the most positive signal in the past months in China-US relations haunted by tit-for-tat tariff retaliations and concerns over a new Cold War.  That they agreed to hold a meeting at the end of this month in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit is another positive signal. And the teams from the two sides will be working hard in the coming weeks to pave the way for a successful meeting.  Despite Trump's China bashing rhetoric during his presidential campaign, the bilateral relationship started unexpectedly well during the first year of the Trump administration when the two leaders met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April last year and again during Trump's state visit to Beijing last November.  But that amicable relationship took a steep downturn when the US singled out China as a revisionist power in its National Security Strategy last December and followed it up by a series of unilateral and hawkish moves against China, including punitive tariffs on imports from China, restrictions on Chinese investment in the US and hostile speeches on China such as the one made by Vice-President Mike Pence at the Hudson Institute on Oct 4.  Fear-mongering about China, including the Chinese news media operating in the US, the 300,000-plus Chinese students studying in US universities and colleges and various academic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, has resurged drastically.  The United States has also flirted with China's core national interests. The US Congress passed the provocative Taiwan Travel Act signed by Trump on March 16 this year. The US also threatened Latin American and African countries which sever ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan to establish formal relations with Beijing.  The dramatic turnabout in Sino-US relations on multiple fronts has triggered deep concern over whether the world's existing power and the rising power are heading into a new Cold War or Thucydides Trap, as Harvard University scholar Graham Allison has warned.  It is no secret that China and the US have major differences. And many of those differences will probably remain for a long time to come. No one, however, should deny that the two countries had far more differences and disagreements back in 1972 when US President Richard Nixon made the historic trip to China and in 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties. Yet the leaders of the two countries showed their wisdom by pursuing a path of expanding cooperation and managing and narrowing differences.  There is no doubt that the more than four decades of active engagement and cooperation have brought huge benefits for the two nations and their peoples, and made the world a safer place, if we recall the extreme hostile relations back in the 1960s and especially the early 1950s when the two countries fought in the bloody Korean War.  As philosopher George Santayana said, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The history of China-US relations serves as a warning for those who advocate a decoupling of the two economies, trigger an arms race and other confrontational approaches.  Tackling the thorny issues between China and the US won't be easy. That is exactly why the two countries should work even harder on those issues through dialogues instead of confrontation. There is no better alternative.  China and the US shoulder a great responsibility in tackling critical global issues, such as epidemic disease, climate change, peacekeeping and global governance.  Let's hope that the upcoming meeting between Xi and Trump will help reverse the course of the past months.  The author is a columnist at China Daily. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
EU in position to stop US from igniting a trade war,3/27/2018,"                      The EU knows full well that global governance has suffered a setback because of the anti-globalization and protectionist decisions made by the Trump administration. US President Donald Trump has taken his protectionist agenda to a new height by imposing unjustifiably high tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese products and restricting Chinese investment in the United States, and all but declaring a ""trade war"" against China. The EU has not been directly targeted by the US. In fact, the European bloc has been seeking ""permanent exemption"" from such US actions, and Washington might accommodate the request, probably because the two sides are security allies. But being one of the champions of multilateral and free trade, the EU also has a global responsibility. Besides, the EU has a high stake in what appears to be the beginning of a global trade war, because of the close inter-dependency of economies in today's world. Up to now, the EU has been sober-minded. At their spring summit last week, the EU leaders said the measures taken by Trump cannot be justified on the grounds of US national security, and regretted that the US had decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But since such statements are not enough to correct the global trade situation or make Trump change his ways, the EU should organize a global debate on the possible impact and consequences of the US' trade policies. If China takes retaliatory action against the US, many experts say, China might increase its trade with the EU, in order to maintain its trade balance. It could also encourage more cultural and people-to-people exchanges with the EU. But those would be short-term measures and cannot control the storm generated by a Sino-US trade conflict, which would create lasting uncertainties and fluctuations in the global market and dent market confidence. Some experts argue the US means to achieve exactly such results, because the resultant contraction of the global financial market would help Wall Street players to take advantage of the dollar's domination of global trade to make more profits, as they did during previous global financial and trade crises. If that is indeed the case, it should set off alarm bells. But the EU, with its financial and material strength, can avoid such a situation. Moreover, to help resolve the global financial crisis, which originated in the US in 2008, the EU put up its financial firewall and implemented institutional reform in an effort to strengthen its banking, monetary and fiscal sectors. Perhaps it is time the EU took similar measures. This, along with the increasing importance of the yuan in global trade, could neutralize the protectionist actions of Trump. Brussels should take such measures also to negate Washington's anti-globalization because a decade ago when the West was in trouble, China injected confidence into world market and extended help to prevent the global financial system from collapsing. Now, when Washington is threatening to derail global trade, which will also hurt the EU, Brussels should play its due role. Beijing and Brussels have already set a good example, by solving their solar panel trade dispute several years through consultations. Now they can also work together to drive sense into the Trump administration, and make Trump realize that the threat to destabilize global trade is not the right card to play to make the US ""great again"".

"High tariffs will not solve US, EU structural problems",3/13/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump speaks on steel and aluminum tariffs during a meeting with industry leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House on March 1, 2018 in Washington, DC. [Photo/VCG]   On March 6, the European Commission decided to extend the existing anti-dumping tariffs, from 48.3 percent to 71.9 percent, on Chinese seamless pipes and stainless steel tubes for another five years. A day later, the EC raised its pitch higher, saying it stands ready to retaliate ""proportionately and fully in line with the World Trade Organization rules"" against US President Donald Trump imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports, except those from Canada and Mexico.  Before the United States decided to impose the tariffs to ""protect"" the US economy, the European Union had been urging it to remove the European bloc from the list of targets because the two sides were allies and security partners.  In response to the US move, steel producing economies such as the EU and China have threatened to levy import duties on US exports. Also, China might consider taking action against the EC's decision to extend the tariffs on Chinese seamless pipes and stainless steel tubes. If the US, too, targets China, the price of retaliation will be high as well.  The rising threat of a trade war reminds one of a Chinese saying: Don't do unto others what you don't want others to do unto you.  The EU and the US have taken excessive remedial measures without acknowledging China's successful efforts to reduce its steel production capacity. The EU and the US, being the world's most sizable and advanced economies, should therefore shoulder their due global responsibilities to maintain the stability of the global economy. Instead, they seem to be threatening global governance, especially in the economic realm.  This is the 10th year of the global financial crisis that originated in the US, and was soon followed by the EU sovereign debt crisis. The financial crisis prompted the G20 leaders to reach a consensus that they would not resort to trade protectionist measures, and implement stimulus packages if needed.China injected part of its foreign exchange reserves and other resources to contribute to the world economy in order to stabilize it. It also implemented economic stimulus measures to contribute more than 30 percent of global economic growth and boost global confidence.  In recent years, more than 1 million Chinese workers have left the steel sector, as a result of reduced steel overcapacity to meet the global agreement. For years, China has been making consistent efforts to rebalance its economy, from export-and investment-led growth to quality-and innovation-oriented growth, by taking measures to increase imports and domestic consumption. The rebalancing efforts will bring tremendous benefits for exporters such as the EU and the US. In fact, China's imports from all its leading trade partners have increased at a significantly faster pace than its exports to them.  As such, the progress China has made should be welcomed and encouraged by the rest of the world, especially the US and the EU. And now that the world economy seems to be returning to normal, the US and the EU should make more efforts to sustain it instead of harming it. The best the EU and the US could do to tide over their problems is to discuss them at multilateral and bilateral forums.  The previous decade saw the world's top economies holding talks to find solutions to global and domestic problems, and deciding to abandon protectionism and the use of punitive measures.  When the going was tough in the global economy, the top economies readily agreed to reach and implement mutually beneficial agreements. It should be easier to honor those mutually beneficial agreements at a time when the global economy has started recovering. The results of collective wisdom to deal with a crisis should not be forgotten.  It's high time therefore that the EU and the US stopped taking trade protectionist measures by slapping higher tariffs on Chinese products and, instead, focused on structural reform to improve their competitiveness in the global market.

Belgium shows its confidence in Belt and Road,2/14/2018,"                      This year is the 10 anniversary of the 2008 calamity of Wall Street, following the fall of the Lehman Brothers, which caused the chronic global financial crisis and economic recession. The recent global stock market plunges, again originating in the United States, have been an unwelcome reminder of their volatility. However, my recent trip to Zeebrugge, a medium-sized sea port in Belgium, showed that a crisis can be transformed into a long chain of opportunities if visionary decisions can be made. The opportunities began in 2010, in the depth of the financial crisis in Europe, when China's automaker Geely acquired Volvo and the Sweden-based company's car operation in Belgium's Ghent, injecting them with new vitality. That started a Sino-Belgian chain reaction with Belgium making good use of its European gateway position and finding synergies with China's Belt and Road Initiative. The Port of Zeebrugge, about sixty kilometers away from Volvo's Ghent operation, is among those following Geely and Volvo's pioneering steps to bring China and Belgium closer. Since last July, thousands of the S90L, Volvo's flagship model, manufactured in the company's Daqing plant in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, have been sent to Zeebrugge port by rail and from there, the cars have been distributed to various European markets. Heading the other way are the Volvo XC60 and V40, as well as auto parts. That has put the advantages of Zeebrugge into full swing. And the authorities of Zeebrugge are aiming even higher by deepening ties with China's mega-shipping company COSCO Shipping. On Jan 22, COSCO Shipping signed an agreement with Port of Zeebrugge for the 50 year concession terms of CSP Zeebrugge Terminal, with COSCO Shipping owning 90 percent of the terminal's share and the CMA, a French shipping line, taking 10 percent. The second-largest port in Belgium, the Port of Zeebrugge is a natural deepwater harbor and has a good network of road and rail connections across Europe. At the signing ceremony, Kris Peeters, Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Work, Economic Affairs and Consumer Affairs, pointed to CSP's investment and last year's opening of a direct train connection between the port and the city of Daqing as proof that China is becoming more significant to Belgium as a trading partner. Zeebrugge is expected to be main northern European hub for China's Belt and Road Initiative with Piraeus Port in Greece the southern hub. The deal could offer direct and indirect jobs amounting to five to 600 for the Belgian port, which is the main port for car transportation in Europe and a key port for food handling. Surely, the port's throughput will grow as China is importing more from Europe to meet various demands of its big market, where the size of middle-income group is about 400 million right now. That equals the total of the United States and Japan, the world's largest and third-largest economies respectively. Belgium, with merely half of Beijing's population, is also deepening its air connectivity with China. Following the direct Shanghai-Brussels flight route launched last year, direct flight between Shenzhen and Brussels will begin in March. Hainan Airline has operated a direct flight between Beijing and Brussels for a number of years. Belgium also became a member of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank last year. The Belgian government and its businesses have clearly made the visionary decision to deepen ties with China. And data indicate the decision is paying off. The trade volume between China and Belgium reached $23.3 billion in 2017, 7.8 percent growth year-on-year, with China's imports from Belgium increasing faster than its exports to the country. This is significant for Belgium, which is a country that relies on trade. Surely, the evolution of Belgium-China economic ties in recent years can serve as evidence that deeper connectivity is good for bilateral or international relations. And that mutually beneficial momentum can be only maintained if there is the political will and wisdom to do so, especially with the international situation at a historically tricky and critical moment.

Compromise allows UK's divorce from EU to progress,12/19/2017,"                          Union Flags and European Union flags fly near the Elizabeth Tower, housing the Big Ben bell, in Parliament Square in central London, Britain September 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Within six months, Brussels and London have more or less sorted out the initial terms of their divorce and beginning January, the talks will focus on how to spend the two years of transitional period and what the future relations will be like.  The two sides have agreed that the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom will be protected and vice versa, and the UK's financial contribution to the European Union will continue until the end of the EU's current budgetary phase in December 2020, though its membership expires on March 29, 2019. And there is to be no hard border between the Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  This has not been an easy process. During the past six months, the bargaining process has been accompanied by quarrels, warnings and even ultimatums, although these elements are normal for any negotiations in which one side is unwillingly involved, as the EU is.  Obviously, the spirit of compromise has been present, with the pace of talks quicker than expected and so far, at least, there have been no market shocks.  And the leaders of the 27 other EU member states endorsed the ""sufficient progress"" that has been made in an outcome document announced on Friday after the bloc's winter summit. They agreed that the talks can be moved into the second phase.  European Council President Donald Tusk even praised British Prime Minister Theresa May for her ""constructive efforts"".  During the new negotiation period beginning January, the teams of both sides have only 10 months to finalize the terms of two-year transitional period and define the framework for their future relationship, which will also be the essential content of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The British parliament, and the European Parliament and EU member states need to go through a legal process over the agreement, which is expected to be ready in October.  But even though the talks so far have been pugnacious, it will be even tougher for both sides to finalize their future trade and economic partnership, because the UK has basically shown its intention not to follow the lead of other countries that have single market or customs union agreements with the EU.  Specifically, the UK does not want to be treated like Norway, which is a non-EU member but in a single market with the EU, allowing free flows of goods, investment and people. Nor does it want to be treated like Turkey, which has a customs union with the EU, facilitating the flow of goods and services between them.  Both sides agree that there should be a ""close relationship"", though they don't know what that will be.  There is one model for relations they could consider. The principles and some text of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership can be used as references for the future relationship talks between the UK and the EU, though the TTIP talks between Washington and Brussels have been shelved since Donald Trump became the US president.  The future relationship between the UK and the EU has no reason to be cooler than the planned transatlantic ties, since the UK is closer than the United States to the EU. That understanding may work as a starting point for both sides to avoid the scenario that the UK and the EU will have failed to define their relations after the transitional period ends in 2021.

"US, EU should fulfill WTO vow to fruits of partnership",12/12/2017,"                      The European Union should have recognized China as a market economy one year ago because, as one of the members of the World Trade Organization, it had agreed to a ""sunset clause"" in 2001, when China joined the WTO, that it would stop using the ""surrogate country"" approach when calculating anti-dumping measures against Chinese imports by Dec 11, 2016.  In 2001, China was allowed a 15-year transitional period by the WTO to reform its economy to meet free trade requirements, which it has done. About 100 economies have already recognized China as a market economy, which means they have stopped using the ""surrogate country"" approach when evaluating Chinese exports.  Normally, in an anti-dumping dispute investigation, countries use the cost of production in a third country to calculate the value of imports from a given country. And as the EU and the United States, China's biggest trade partners, are still reluctant to abandon this approach, Chinese businesses face high anti-dumping tariffs.  Moreover, the Donald Trump-led US administration recently said it will not recognize China as a market economy, even as Beijing has asked the WTO to investigate the case.  Since being sworn in as US president, Trump has taken several measures that go against the spirit and trend of globalization thanks to his ""America First"" policy.  The EU's actions have been somewhat different. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has already listed boosting globalization as one of his top 10 priorities. Although Juncker tried to promote the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US at the start of his term as EC president in 2014, in the hope of reaping rich benefits from it, he dropped the idea later because of the ""closed-door"" policy of the US, especially after Trump entered the White House.  But the EU is still to fully recognize China as a market economy. Indeed, it is time the EU did so and set an example for the other economies. Specifically, the EU should fulfill its promises according to Article 15 of the accession protocol signed when China joined the WTO in 2001.  In Chinese culture, promise is debt. And debt has to be paid.  Early this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel basically helped relieve the concern during her talks with visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. But the EU did not respond positively when Li held talks with European leaders during his second leg of the visit. When Li met European Council President Donald Tusk at the ASEAN and East Asia leaders' meetings in Manila in November, he once again raised the issue, hoping the EU would fulfill its obligations vis-a-vis China, in order to support free trade and globalization.  But the EU has linked the fulfilling of its written commitment to other issues, which include the further opening up of China's market and reducing steel overcapacity. This is unreasonable, because the two issues should be dealt with differently. The EU and WTO members should honor the pledges they made 15 years ago, without adding any more conditions, because their original commitment didn't include additional requests.  During the Brexit talks, the EU asked the United Kingdom to fulfill the financial commitments the latter had made before the start of the ongoing 2014-20 budgetary phase. On Friday, the UK agreed to the honor those financial promises by 2020, even though it will cease to be an EU member from March 2019. If the UK had not agreed, the EU would have not continued the talks to determine the future relationship between Brussels and London.  The Brexit case is relevant to China in the context of WTO rules and the developed economies' biased attitude toward China, because it shows economies have to fulfill their pledges in order to enjoy the fruits of economic partnership.

Fijian dialogue process makes Bonn climate talks a 'success',11/21/2017,"                      The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which concluded over the weekend was no different from the other annual gatherings since 1995, when the world leaders decided to sit together to find ways to cope with climate change.  The negotiators in Bonn burned the midnight oil on the last day of the conference to come up with the final document. But once again the rich countries didn't commit to paying the $100 billion they had promised to developing economies by 2020 to help the latter cope with and adapt to climate change. And, as they have done earlier, some Western outlets said the Bonn talks made ""little progress"".  However, the Bonn talks can be seen as a ""success"" if we consider it a critical step toward completing the ""rule-book"" for the 2015 Paris Agreement.  This conference was organized at a time when the international community seems ""increasingly divided"", mainly because some of the Western powers have not fulfilled the commitments they made at some previous climate talks. For example, US President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, although the European Union was an active player at the Bonn talks. The international community, it seems, needs some positive energy to work together to deal with the common threat to humanity.  Some of that energy was evident in Bonn, though.  Although Fiji, which has already seen the consequences of global warming, held the presidency for this year's climate talks, the event was hosted by Germany, because the funds needed for and the logistics of hosting such an event were too much for the Pacific island country. This explicit and fruitful understanding between the Fijian and German governments showed that an industrialized country and a less-developed one can join hands to deal with common threats.  Moreover, the international community accepted the Pacific island's wisdom by including the ""Talanoa Dialogue"", a Fijian concept that encourages people to listen to each other, respect each other's views, and seek solutions that benefit everybody-in other words, a process of inclusion and transparent dialogue that will lead to the ""rule book"" to be adopted at next year's conference in Katowice, Poland.  This encouraging cooperation-oriented approach is likely to enrich global climate politics, which have long been dominated by the pressure, finger-pointing and dilly-dallying tactics of some Western countries and media outlets.  Certain factors are essential to climate talks. First, which country, or countries, has contributed most to global warming? Second, joint efforts are needed to fight climate change but the process of seeking solutions should be inclusive and democratic. And, most importantly, promises made on paper should be honored and fulfilled. In this regard, the Talanoa Dialogue can help build mutual trust and understanding, which the international community badly needs.  The Paris Agreement, ratified by 170 economies, is part of an ambitious global effort to deal with global warming in the period after 2020. To realize this agreement, the UN had asked every country to submit its plan for voluntary contribution to reducing global greenhouse gas emission. This approach gave enough room to each country to raise its targets while implementing the Paris Agreement.  Now, the Talanoa Dialogue process is expected to help each participant to share its knowledge of low-carbon development model with the others, and vice-versa. Such dialogue could inspire countries to embark on a green path of development, which the negotiators in Bonn described as a post-2020 ambitious plan, which will also need the transfer of low-carbon technology and funds from the rich countries to the poorer ones to succeed.  Also, as agreed in the Kyoto Protocol and the second phase of this landmark global deal, the rich countries have to honor their promises both in letter and spirit.  And if that happens, the transition from Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement will be smooth even if the US, the world's largest economy, remains a non-party to the two historic climate pacts.

EU could take a leaf out of China's book on diplomacy,11/14/2017,"                              Zhang Ming, China's new ambassador to the EU, submitted his national credentials to European Council President Donald Tusk on 8 Nov, 2017  in Brussels. [Provided to China Daily]    This time last year, as the world was coming to terms with Donald Trump winning the US presidential election, Europeans and Chinese worried about the president-elect's provocative rhetoric and what he would do in office.    Last week, Trump visited China and tweeted his sincere thanks to President Xi Jinping after concluding possibly his happiest foreign visit yet, and vowed to build even stronger relations with China.  There was much work done behind the scenes to make his visit such a success and much more is required to maintain the current positive momentum in Sino-US relations, although the deals worth billions of dollars agreed during his trip showed the potential that can be tapped by strengthening their cooperation.  How the relationship between China and the United States has developed should offer food for thought for the European Union, when it considers its relationship with the world's major countries.  Many European opinion leaders are not satisfied with the quality of the EU's relations with the US, Russia, China, and even Turkey. They say that Europe's relations with these countries should not be so bad.  It could learn something from China's experiences and diplomatic approach.  China does not believe in the outdated zero-sum game, which the West has insisted on for so long. China believes in seeking harmony when developing foreign relations, and especially in its pursuit of a new type of major power relations featuring coordination and cooperation.  The Chinese leadership knows that good relations with the US president and his country are crucial for China's development and world peace and prosperity.  Such a sincere and proactive approach has helped foster good relations with Trump and the US. It would not have been possible if China had acted as EU does when it deals with the US.  The last meeting between Donald Trump and European leaders was not fruitful, although European Council President Donald Tusk invited Trump for a summit as soon as he was elected.  And even though the EU has highlighted it as one of the bloc's 10 priorities, the talks on their Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have been shelved.  Of course, it is not only the EU that should be blamed for the frosty relations with the US, whose healthy development is critical for the global family. However, the EU, as a global player, could follow China's example by being more pragmatic in its diplomatic approach toward the US so as to ensure global development, peace and security.  The EU usually bears this in mind in its dealings with China. Many EU member states, for example, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Greece, have already forged close ties with China.  President Xi visited the headquarters of the EU in early 2014, calling on both sides to become partners for peace, growth, reform and civilization. And in a recent interview, former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said he was impressed by Xi's proposals when he received the Chinese president.  Last week, when meeting Zhang Ming, the head of the Chinese mission to the EU, European Council President Tusk said he treasured his sound personal and work relations with Chinese leaders and China had a high priority in the EU's foreign relations.  Such recognition is encouraging. But what is more important is for both sides to take concrete actions to make the Sino-EU relationship even closer and stronger. That would be beneficial for the two sides whose combined population is almost 2 billion.  The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.  fujing@chinadaily.com.cn         "
EU-US trade relations experiencing a bumpy ride,9/5/2017,"                                              A ship loads containers at a terminal in Qingdao, Shandong province. [Photo/China Daily]    In his third state of union address to the European Parliament on Sept 13, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker should refer to a check list of his team's 10 priorities when he took office in late 2014, and assess to what extent it has fulfilled them in three years-or more than halfway into his term.    On the economic front, the European Union has been doing a relatively good job-it has phased out the roaming charges for cellphone users, a big step toward improving connectivity, and struck trade deals with several economies including Canada and Japan.  Even as the progress on internal integration has been slow, the EU now faces three new challenges that Juncker must focus on in his speech-rising terrorist attacks and plots, the United Kingdom's departure from the 28-member bloc and the deteriorating relationship (in political terms) between Washington and Brussels.  Juncker has not been able to fully explain the decline in EU-US ties since Donald Trump succeeded Barack Obama as the United States president in January. In late 2014, Juncker sounded confident of consolidating the EU's trade relations with the US through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. But after 15 rounds of talks since July 2013, the agreement has been shelved.  Trump has also withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a deal the Obama administration aggressively promoted in the Asia-Pacific region to isolate China. The TPP's objectives were always in doubt, but the fact that the incumbent US president put it to death, ostensibly to fulfill his presidential campaign promise, speaks volumes about its dubious goals. But then Trump has also dealt a blow to the multilateral global governance system by pulling out of the Paris climate change agreement.  The fate of TTIP, too, seems sealed, as there are no signs of Washington and Brussels engaging in fresh talks, while three rounds of talks on Brexit have not yielded any concrete results. This makes it all the more important for Juncker to explain the current state of Washington-Brussels ties in his address.  Juncker cannot put the entire blame on Trump for the jittery EU-US ties. True, the EU has the capability of taking a more proactive approach while dealing with the Trump administration. But Brussels is yet to do so.  Besides, Brussels has also not engaged with China in accordance with global rules. To begin with, the EU has not yet fulfilled its World Trade Organization commitment of recognizing China as a market economy; instead it is reportedly preparing to launch investment-related new screening policy against China.  This seems strange, especially because many believe Brussels should consolidate its economic relations with Beijing to offset the effects of its deteriorating ties with Washington. Some believe Brussels still has ample trust in Washington despite Trump being at the helm of US affairs, because traditionally the relationship between Europe and the US has always been strong.  Still, Juncker has to respond to EU citizens' query on the future of Brussels-Washington relations and how the TTIP will evolve, if ever. Basically, Juncker and the rest of the EU leaders have to change their mindset, as in today's fast-changing world, Brussels has to rework its policies that are directed at favoring one or a couple of economies. The TTIP is welcome if it helps the world to reduce trade barriers and promote globalization.  But that shouldn't prevent the EU from taking measures to improve trade ties with its other trade partners such as China.

EU should regulate investment cautiously,8/1/2017,"                              Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers a keynote speech at the 12th EU-China Business Summit in Brussels on June 2, 2017. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]       In the last 60 years, the European Union has expanded from six members to 28, but the battle over the responsibilities of Brussels and individual EU states has not abated. The latest skirmish is over Brussel's eagerness to centralize the approval process for European companies' takeovers by foreign enterprises amid an explosion of Chinese investment in the EU.  Brussels wants to strengthen the approval procedures for foreign investors that target ""key technologies for security reasons"", and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is likely to announce regulation options in September.  Some EU member states argue such a move is not necessary because many of them already have such screening process in place. There are many reasons why Brussels considers such regulation important. However, there is a need for the EU to be cautious while it is in the process of shaping the bloc's future.  The United Kingdom's decision to break away from the EU was at the heart of the debate over the responsibilities of the EU and its members states. Hence, the EU must consider whether adding another layer of red tape will put internal cohesion, efficiency and economic growth at risk.  As a champion of free trade, the EU needs to recognize that other economic powers are removing trade and investment restrictions. For example, China is now trimming its approval regulations and documents to meet its reform goals, in order to ensure that investment approvals are completed at the provincial or local level, instead of needing the green light from the central government to finalize each and every deal.  To improve its efficiency, perhaps the EU should follow China's example of economic decentralization. The EU's proposed investment restrictions come on the heels of a similar move by the United States, which keeps taking steps to close the door on Chinese investment.  Washington has built trade barriers, on the pretext of security reasons, to prevent China's telecommunications giant Huawei from venturing into the US, but the EU has welcomed Huawei, which has created 11,000 jobs in Europe. Huawei's contribution to the job market has yielded excellent results in the past six years, during a good part of which many parts of the EU were fighting recession.  The EU's open attitude toward investment created a win-win situation. China has rapidly improved its competence in technologies through investment, trade and transfer of knowledge with the EU, the US and other countries. When formulating new policies, therefore, the EU should consider if these policies will contribute to economic growth or retard it. And if the effects of the policies are likely to harm growth, it should discard them.  In the evolving and turbulent global situation, the EU must shoulder its responsibilities while it ponders its future. It should assert its independence from the US in defense and high-tech industries. Only free trade of technologies can help turn win-win potential into reality. It is now for the EU to decide whether building trade barriers is conducive to the economic growth of the bloc and the rest of the world or harmful to all.

Stick to openness while defending Paris Agreement,7/18/2017,"                      After US President Donald Trump said he would pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change, French President Emmanuel Macron replied that he was on a mission to ""make our planet great again"", a play on Trump's catchphrase, ""Make America Great Again"".  Macron has met Trump's rejection with a celebration of the signing of the historic agreement, which 153 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have ratified.  In spite of Trump's antipathy to the consensus on climate change, which seeks to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030, Macron has adopted a pragmatic approach by engaging him and trying to bring him back on board, after the other leaders of the G20 agreed in Hamburg that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. Macron has recently planed to organize a climate summit to mark the second anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement on Dec 12 in France.  The French president has even been rewarded with positive noises from Trump during his visit to Paris on July 13-14 and the concession that ""something could be done"" on the issue.  Macron's next task should be to ensure that no further countries follow the US and pull out of the Paris Agreement. For example, Canada followed the US' lead by abandoning the Kyoto Protocol.  But Macron is proving to be a stout defender of the Paris Agreement. Within weeks of his presidency, Macron has shown his pragmatism by actively engaging China, the US, Germany and other global players and extolling the benefits of coordinated action on climate change.  China and France are united in defending the Paris Agreement.  He has also invited US climate researchers to France and even focused on climate finance, which has long been an issue that needed to be addressed by rich countries.  While climate is high on Macron's agenda, the French president has also said he wants to alter the regulation on trade and investment.  Macron needs to be very cautious in shaping his vision of Europe. Right now, he is trying to tighten scrutiny of foreign investment activities in the European Union, which is signing free trade agreements with some of its partners.  For politicians, market protection and protectionism seem very similar but the former is acceptable, while the latter is one step too far. Macron must accept the reality that openness has already benefited his country, the EU and the world by promoting technology transfer, capital injection and inward investment. For the EU, its priority should be to trim bureaucracy, instead of beefing up its regulations.  The US also scrutinizes investment in the name of national security. But this mainly works as a barrier and sometimes a useful card to play.  The EU, a global leader of climate protection, free trade and an open economy, should not follow such old-fashioned practices. What's more, the essence of the Paris Agreement is global development paradigm change, and ample finance and technology transfers from the rich countries can help less-developing countries avoid development traps and environmental woes.  France has played a major role in defending international cooperation on climate change. It should approach trade with the same spirit. If so, the numerous goals in the Paris Agreement could be turned into reality faster than expected.  The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.  fujing@chinadaily.com.cn         "
G20 must put actions to its words if it is to deliver on its consensus,7/11/2017,"                      A comparison of the outcome documents from the G20 summit in Hamburg that concluded on Saturday and those produced at the Washington gathering, the first such meeting between the leaders of the 20 major economies held two months after the fall of financial giant Lehman Brothers in 2008, leads to both encouraging and worrisome observations.  After intensive diplomatic efforts from the team of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, possibly the only leader who has participated in all 12 summits, the topics put on the agenda have gone far beyond risk management, financial market regulation, financial liquidity guarantees and the urgency of reviving economic growth, which were heavily debated at the first summit.  At that time, the major task of the international community was to avoid a dysfunctional global market by engaging with emerging economies such as China to ensure the global financial system remained workable.  During the global economic recession, the most damaging one after the Great Depression in 1929-33, China contributed half of the global economic growth and even now the share of its contribution, according to the International Monetary Fund, stands at around 30 percent.  In return, China has gained some of its due say in international economic governance, and the renminbi has been included in the global currency basket, increasingly swapped at bilateral level and recently even bought by European Central Bank as a reserve currency.  China has taken lead in setting up new multilateral financing platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank based in Beijing and the BRICS bank, or New Development Bank, based in Shanghai. And it proposed and is advancing the Belt and Road Initiative as a way to stimulate global economic growth and make it more inclusive.  China's contribution is shown in the Hamburg documents, and the 15-page declaration and several annexes show consensus was reached on pursuing greater economic openness, free trade, energy and sustainable development, the digital economy, partnership with Africa, health and the empowerment of women.  It gives the impression agreements were reached on everything except climate change, on which the US is at odds with the other members.  Despite this, the outcomes are encouraging. Compared with their vision shown at G20 summit in Washington, it is a big step forward.  However, it is clear there is still a lack of collective global leadership and political trust.  For instance, India is provoking China by sending troops across their border, the US is aggressively displaying its military might in the Asia-Pacific region, the differences between Europe and the US are expanding and also the relations between Russia and the West are unfriendly.  In the documents for the G20 summit in Washington and even those held in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, phrases such as ""refrain from"" were frequently included and most of the G20 members delivered on their words with actions.  Now, it is obvious that such a shared political will is fading. Some members are turning to domestic market protection, geopolitical calculation and a military buildup, instead of finding ways to offer more global public goods to really turn their consensus into reality.  And it is harder for the major powers to reach compromises now. The US once again, similar to its trick with the Kyoto Protocol, confirmed its withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement. That is damaging to international cooperation as every other country believes the biggest economy should be a trustworthy partner and therefore should implement the deal as agreed.  The situation is worrying. If political trust cannot be forged, the spirit of making compromises will not be sustained, and the G20 consensus will be only on paper.

"On China's 'diplomatic chessboard', Germany is an important piece",7/4/2017,"                      On China's diplomatic chessboard the significance of Germany and other European Union member states can be gauged from the frequent visits President Xi Jinping has paid to those countries. In fact, he is due to arrive in Berlin on Tuesday to pay another state visit to Germany, during which he will also attend this year's G20 summit in Hamburg.  China has always attached great importance to Germany.  This is Xi's second state visit to Germany after his previous one in March 2014. What's more, the Chinese president's visit this year follows just one month after Premier Li Keqiang's tour to Germany. And Li also paid a visit to Germany in 2014.  Germany attaches equal importance to China, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has visited China many times during her term in office. Actually, an official in the chancellor's office said Merkel probably doesn't attach such importance to any other country.  Germany is a competitive exporter and manufacturer, and thus an ideal model for China. Its social welfare and market system have been widely debated in China, which is undergoing market-oriented reform. And for decades, Germany has had a big share in China's market. For example, German car brands, such as Volkswagen, Audi, BMW and Mercedes, are omnipresent in China.  And since Chinese investors have just started to explore the opportunities in the high-end product market, Xi is likely to discuss with German leaders how to further boost bilateral ties and become bigger players in each other's markets by removing trade and investment barriers.  Globalization faces increasing challenges, especially with the United Kingdom's departure from the EU and US President Donald Trump's inward-looking policy to ""make America Great Again"", which is nothing but trade protectionism.  Trump has also pulled the United States out of the global climate change agreement, which almost every UN member state welcomed and signed in Paris in 2015.  Germany has been championing free trade, closer global connectivity and remains committed to fighting climate change. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Xi affirmed China's commitment to globalization and free trade, a commitment EU commentators and politicians alike have repeatedly cited and welcomed.  For China, Germany is not only a market but also a platform to explore the entire EU economy. In recent years, Beijing has been viewing Sino-German ties beyond the two countries' markets, whose consumers add up to 1.9 billion.  That's one of the reasons Xi proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. And Germany's positive response to the initiative prompted other EU countries to join it. For example, China initiated the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which many EU countries joined as founding members to explore more opportunities in third-party markets.  Xi's visit to Germany is of great importance to EU-China ties. China has higher hopes of establishing better relations with the EU as a whole.  Xi's visits to Germany and other EU countries indicate China's sincerity in developing closer partnership with the European bloc.  As the host of the G20 summit, a platform where global issues are discussed, Germany needs support to ensure the success of the event. And Xi, who hosted G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou in September last year, is expected to provide that support.

Compromise allows UK's divorce from EU to progress,12/19/2017,"                          Union Flags and European Union flags fly near the Elizabeth Tower, housing the Big Ben bell, in Parliament Square in central London, Britain September 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   Within six months, Brussels and London have more or less sorted out the initial terms of their divorce and beginning January, the talks will focus on how to spend the two years of transitional period and what the future relations will be like.  The two sides have agreed that the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom will be protected and vice versa, and the UK's financial contribution to the European Union will continue until the end of the EU's current budgetary phase in December 2020, though its membership expires on March 29, 2019. And there is to be no hard border between the Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  This has not been an easy process. During the past six months, the bargaining process has been accompanied by quarrels, warnings and even ultimatums, although these elements are normal for any negotiations in which one side is unwillingly involved, as the EU is.  Obviously, the spirit of compromise has been present, with the pace of talks quicker than expected and so far, at least, there have been no market shocks.  And the leaders of the 27 other EU member states endorsed the ""sufficient progress"" that has been made in an outcome document announced on Friday after the bloc's winter summit. They agreed that the talks can be moved into the second phase.  European Council President Donald Tusk even praised British Prime Minister Theresa May for her ""constructive efforts"".  During the new negotiation period beginning January, the teams of both sides have only 10 months to finalize the terms of two-year transitional period and define the framework for their future relationship, which will also be the essential content of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The British parliament, and the European Parliament and EU member states need to go through a legal process over the agreement, which is expected to be ready in October.  But even though the talks so far have been pugnacious, it will be even tougher for both sides to finalize their future trade and economic partnership, because the UK has basically shown its intention not to follow the lead of other countries that have single market or customs union agreements with the EU.  Specifically, the UK does not want to be treated like Norway, which is a non-EU member but in a single market with the EU, allowing free flows of goods, investment and people. Nor does it want to be treated like Turkey, which has a customs union with the EU, facilitating the flow of goods and services between them.  Both sides agree that there should be a ""close relationship"", though they don't know what that will be.  There is one model for relations they could consider. The principles and some text of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership can be used as references for the future relationship talks between the UK and the EU, though the TTIP talks between Washington and Brussels have been shelved since Donald Trump became the US president.  The future relationship between the UK and the EU has no reason to be cooler than the planned transatlantic ties, since the UK is closer than the United States to the EU. That understanding may work as a starting point for both sides to avoid the scenario that the UK and the EU will have failed to define their relations after the transitional period ends in 2021.

"US, EU should fulfill WTO vow to fruits of partnership",12/12/2017,"                      The European Union should have recognized China as a market economy one year ago because, as one of the members of the World Trade Organization, it had agreed to a ""sunset clause"" in 2001, when China joined the WTO, that it would stop using the ""surrogate country"" approach when calculating anti-dumping measures against Chinese imports by Dec 11, 2016.  In 2001, China was allowed a 15-year transitional period by the WTO to reform its economy to meet free trade requirements, which it has done. About 100 economies have already recognized China as a market economy, which means they have stopped using the ""surrogate country"" approach when evaluating Chinese exports.  Normally, in an anti-dumping dispute investigation, countries use the cost of production in a third country to calculate the value of imports from a given country. And as the EU and the United States, China's biggest trade partners, are still reluctant to abandon this approach, Chinese businesses face high anti-dumping tariffs.  Moreover, the Donald Trump-led US administration recently said it will not recognize China as a market economy, even as Beijing has asked the WTO to investigate the case.  Since being sworn in as US president, Trump has taken several measures that go against the spirit and trend of globalization thanks to his ""America First"" policy.  The EU's actions have been somewhat different. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has already listed boosting globalization as one of his top 10 priorities. Although Juncker tried to promote the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US at the start of his term as EC president in 2014, in the hope of reaping rich benefits from it, he dropped the idea later because of the ""closed-door"" policy of the US, especially after Trump entered the White House.  But the EU is still to fully recognize China as a market economy. Indeed, it is time the EU did so and set an example for the other economies. Specifically, the EU should fulfill its promises according to Article 15 of the accession protocol signed when China joined the WTO in 2001.  In Chinese culture, promise is debt. And debt has to be paid.  Early this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel basically helped relieve the concern during her talks with visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. But the EU did not respond positively when Li held talks with European leaders during his second leg of the visit. When Li met European Council President Donald Tusk at the ASEAN and East Asia leaders' meetings in Manila in November, he once again raised the issue, hoping the EU would fulfill its obligations vis-a-vis China, in order to support free trade and globalization.  But the EU has linked the fulfilling of its written commitment to other issues, which include the further opening up of China's market and reducing steel overcapacity. This is unreasonable, because the two issues should be dealt with differently. The EU and WTO members should honor the pledges they made 15 years ago, without adding any more conditions, because their original commitment didn't include additional requests.  During the Brexit talks, the EU asked the United Kingdom to fulfill the financial commitments the latter had made before the start of the ongoing 2014-20 budgetary phase. On Friday, the UK agreed to the honor those financial promises by 2020, even though it will cease to be an EU member from March 2019. If the UK had not agreed, the EU would have not continued the talks to determine the future relationship between Brussels and London.  The Brexit case is relevant to China in the context of WTO rules and the developed economies' biased attitude toward China, because it shows economies have to fulfill their pledges in order to enjoy the fruits of economic partnership.

Fijian dialogue process makes Bonn climate talks a 'success',11/21/2017,"                      The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which concluded over the weekend was no different from the other annual gatherings since 1995, when the world leaders decided to sit together to find ways to cope with climate change.  The negotiators in Bonn burned the midnight oil on the last day of the conference to come up with the final document. But once again the rich countries didn't commit to paying the $100 billion they had promised to developing economies by 2020 to help the latter cope with and adapt to climate change. And, as they have done earlier, some Western outlets said the Bonn talks made ""little progress"".  However, the Bonn talks can be seen as a ""success"" if we consider it a critical step toward completing the ""rule-book"" for the 2015 Paris Agreement.  This conference was organized at a time when the international community seems ""increasingly divided"", mainly because some of the Western powers have not fulfilled the commitments they made at some previous climate talks. For example, US President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, although the European Union was an active player at the Bonn talks. The international community, it seems, needs some positive energy to work together to deal with the common threat to humanity.  Some of that energy was evident in Bonn, though.  Although Fiji, which has already seen the consequences of global warming, held the presidency for this year's climate talks, the event was hosted by Germany, because the funds needed for and the logistics of hosting such an event were too much for the Pacific island country. This explicit and fruitful understanding between the Fijian and German governments showed that an industrialized country and a less-developed one can join hands to deal with common threats.  Moreover, the international community accepted the Pacific island's wisdom by including the ""Talanoa Dialogue"", a Fijian concept that encourages people to listen to each other, respect each other's views, and seek solutions that benefit everybody-in other words, a process of inclusion and transparent dialogue that will lead to the ""rule book"" to be adopted at next year's conference in Katowice, Poland.  This encouraging cooperation-oriented approach is likely to enrich global climate politics, which have long been dominated by the pressure, finger-pointing and dilly-dallying tactics of some Western countries and media outlets.  Certain factors are essential to climate talks. First, which country, or countries, has contributed most to global warming? Second, joint efforts are needed to fight climate change but the process of seeking solutions should be inclusive and democratic. And, most importantly, promises made on paper should be honored and fulfilled. In this regard, the Talanoa Dialogue can help build mutual trust and understanding, which the international community badly needs.  The Paris Agreement, ratified by 170 economies, is part of an ambitious global effort to deal with global warming in the period after 2020. To realize this agreement, the UN had asked every country to submit its plan for voluntary contribution to reducing global greenhouse gas emission. This approach gave enough room to each country to raise its targets while implementing the Paris Agreement.  Now, the Talanoa Dialogue process is expected to help each participant to share its knowledge of low-carbon development model with the others, and vice-versa. Such dialogue could inspire countries to embark on a green path of development, which the negotiators in Bonn described as a post-2020 ambitious plan, which will also need the transfer of low-carbon technology and funds from the rich countries to the poorer ones to succeed.  Also, as agreed in the Kyoto Protocol and the second phase of this landmark global deal, the rich countries have to honor their promises both in letter and spirit.  And if that happens, the transition from Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement will be smooth even if the US, the world's largest economy, remains a non-party to the two historic climate pacts.

EU could take a leaf out of China's book on diplomacy,11/14/2017,"                              Zhang Ming, China's new ambassador to the EU, submitted his national credentials to European Council President Donald Tusk on 8 Nov, 2017  in Brussels. [Provided to China Daily]    This time last year, as the world was coming to terms with Donald Trump winning the US presidential election, Europeans and Chinese worried about the president-elect's provocative rhetoric and what he would do in office.    Last week, Trump visited China and tweeted his sincere thanks to President Xi Jinping after concluding possibly his happiest foreign visit yet, and vowed to build even stronger relations with China.  There was much work done behind the scenes to make his visit such a success and much more is required to maintain the current positive momentum in Sino-US relations, although the deals worth billions of dollars agreed during his trip showed the potential that can be tapped by strengthening their cooperation.  How the relationship between China and the United States has developed should offer food for thought for the European Union, when it considers its relationship with the world's major countries.  Many European opinion leaders are not satisfied with the quality of the EU's relations with the US, Russia, China, and even Turkey. They say that Europe's relations with these countries should not be so bad.  It could learn something from China's experiences and diplomatic approach.  China does not believe in the outdated zero-sum game, which the West has insisted on for so long. China believes in seeking harmony when developing foreign relations, and especially in its pursuit of a new type of major power relations featuring coordination and cooperation.  The Chinese leadership knows that good relations with the US president and his country are crucial for China's development and world peace and prosperity.  Such a sincere and proactive approach has helped foster good relations with Trump and the US. It would not have been possible if China had acted as EU does when it deals with the US.  The last meeting between Donald Trump and European leaders was not fruitful, although European Council President Donald Tusk invited Trump for a summit as soon as he was elected.  And even though the EU has highlighted it as one of the bloc's 10 priorities, the talks on their Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have been shelved.  Of course, it is not only the EU that should be blamed for the frosty relations with the US, whose healthy development is critical for the global family. However, the EU, as a global player, could follow China's example by being more pragmatic in its diplomatic approach toward the US so as to ensure global development, peace and security.  The EU usually bears this in mind in its dealings with China. Many EU member states, for example, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Greece, have already forged close ties with China.  President Xi visited the headquarters of the EU in early 2014, calling on both sides to become partners for peace, growth, reform and civilization. And in a recent interview, former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said he was impressed by Xi's proposals when he received the Chinese president.  Last week, when meeting Zhang Ming, the head of the Chinese mission to the EU, European Council President Tusk said he treasured his sound personal and work relations with Chinese leaders and China had a high priority in the EU's foreign relations.  Such recognition is encouraging. But what is more important is for both sides to take concrete actions to make the Sino-EU relationship even closer and stronger. That would be beneficial for the two sides whose combined population is almost 2 billion.  The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.  fujing@chinadaily.com.cn         "
EU-US trade relations experiencing a bumpy ride,9/5/2017,"                                              A ship loads containers at a terminal in Qingdao, Shandong province. [Photo/China Daily]    In his third state of union address to the European Parliament on Sept 13, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker should refer to a check list of his team's 10 priorities when he took office in late 2014, and assess to what extent it has fulfilled them in three years-or more than halfway into his term.    On the economic front, the European Union has been doing a relatively good job-it has phased out the roaming charges for cellphone users, a big step toward improving connectivity, and struck trade deals with several economies including Canada and Japan.  Even as the progress on internal integration has been slow, the EU now faces three new challenges that Juncker must focus on in his speech-rising terrorist attacks and plots, the United Kingdom's departure from the 28-member bloc and the deteriorating relationship (in political terms) between Washington and Brussels.  Juncker has not been able to fully explain the decline in EU-US ties since Donald Trump succeeded Barack Obama as the United States president in January. In late 2014, Juncker sounded confident of consolidating the EU's trade relations with the US through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. But after 15 rounds of talks since July 2013, the agreement has been shelved.  Trump has also withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a deal the Obama administration aggressively promoted in the Asia-Pacific region to isolate China. The TPP's objectives were always in doubt, but the fact that the incumbent US president put it to death, ostensibly to fulfill his presidential campaign promise, speaks volumes about its dubious goals. But then Trump has also dealt a blow to the multilateral global governance system by pulling out of the Paris climate change agreement.  The fate of TTIP, too, seems sealed, as there are no signs of Washington and Brussels engaging in fresh talks, while three rounds of talks on Brexit have not yielded any concrete results. This makes it all the more important for Juncker to explain the current state of Washington-Brussels ties in his address.  Juncker cannot put the entire blame on Trump for the jittery EU-US ties. True, the EU has the capability of taking a more proactive approach while dealing with the Trump administration. But Brussels is yet to do so.  Besides, Brussels has also not engaged with China in accordance with global rules. To begin with, the EU has not yet fulfilled its World Trade Organization commitment of recognizing China as a market economy; instead it is reportedly preparing to launch investment-related new screening policy against China.  This seems strange, especially because many believe Brussels should consolidate its economic relations with Beijing to offset the effects of its deteriorating ties with Washington. Some believe Brussels still has ample trust in Washington despite Trump being at the helm of US affairs, because traditionally the relationship between Europe and the US has always been strong.  Still, Juncker has to respond to EU citizens' query on the future of Brussels-Washington relations and how the TTIP will evolve, if ever. Basically, Juncker and the rest of the EU leaders have to change their mindset, as in today's fast-changing world, Brussels has to rework its policies that are directed at favoring one or a couple of economies. The TTIP is welcome if it helps the world to reduce trade barriers and promote globalization.  But that shouldn't prevent the EU from taking measures to improve trade ties with its other trade partners such as China.

EU should regulate investment cautiously,8/1/2017,"                              Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers a keynote speech at the 12th EU-China Business Summit in Brussels on June 2, 2017. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]       In the last 60 years, the European Union has expanded from six members to 28, but the battle over the responsibilities of Brussels and individual EU states has not abated. The latest skirmish is over Brussel's eagerness to centralize the approval process for European companies' takeovers by foreign enterprises amid an explosion of Chinese investment in the EU.  Brussels wants to strengthen the approval procedures for foreign investors that target ""key technologies for security reasons"", and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is likely to announce regulation options in September.  Some EU member states argue such a move is not necessary because many of them already have such screening process in place. There are many reasons why Brussels considers such regulation important. However, there is a need for the EU to be cautious while it is in the process of shaping the bloc's future.  The United Kingdom's decision to break away from the EU was at the heart of the debate over the responsibilities of the EU and its members states. Hence, the EU must consider whether adding another layer of red tape will put internal cohesion, efficiency and economic growth at risk.  As a champion of free trade, the EU needs to recognize that other economic powers are removing trade and investment restrictions. For example, China is now trimming its approval regulations and documents to meet its reform goals, in order to ensure that investment approvals are completed at the provincial or local level, instead of needing the green light from the central government to finalize each and every deal.  To improve its efficiency, perhaps the EU should follow China's example of economic decentralization. The EU's proposed investment restrictions come on the heels of a similar move by the United States, which keeps taking steps to close the door on Chinese investment.  Washington has built trade barriers, on the pretext of security reasons, to prevent China's telecommunications giant Huawei from venturing into the US, but the EU has welcomed Huawei, which has created 11,000 jobs in Europe. Huawei's contribution to the job market has yielded excellent results in the past six years, during a good part of which many parts of the EU were fighting recession.  The EU's open attitude toward investment created a win-win situation. China has rapidly improved its competence in technologies through investment, trade and transfer of knowledge with the EU, the US and other countries. When formulating new policies, therefore, the EU should consider if these policies will contribute to economic growth or retard it. And if the effects of the policies are likely to harm growth, it should discard them.  In the evolving and turbulent global situation, the EU must shoulder its responsibilities while it ponders its future. It should assert its independence from the US in defense and high-tech industries. Only free trade of technologies can help turn win-win potential into reality. It is now for the EU to decide whether building trade barriers is conducive to the economic growth of the bloc and the rest of the world or harmful to all.

Stick to openness while defending Paris Agreement,7/18/2017,"                      After US President Donald Trump said he would pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change, French President Emmanuel Macron replied that he was on a mission to ""make our planet great again"", a play on Trump's catchphrase, ""Make America Great Again"".  Macron has met Trump's rejection with a celebration of the signing of the historic agreement, which 153 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have ratified.  In spite of Trump's antipathy to the consensus on climate change, which seeks to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030, Macron has adopted a pragmatic approach by engaging him and trying to bring him back on board, after the other leaders of the G20 agreed in Hamburg that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. Macron has recently planed to organize a climate summit to mark the second anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement on Dec 12 in France.  The French president has even been rewarded with positive noises from Trump during his visit to Paris on July 13-14 and the concession that ""something could be done"" on the issue.  Macron's next task should be to ensure that no further countries follow the US and pull out of the Paris Agreement. For example, Canada followed the US' lead by abandoning the Kyoto Protocol.  But Macron is proving to be a stout defender of the Paris Agreement. Within weeks of his presidency, Macron has shown his pragmatism by actively engaging China, the US, Germany and other global players and extolling the benefits of coordinated action on climate change.  China and France are united in defending the Paris Agreement.  He has also invited US climate researchers to France and even focused on climate finance, which has long been an issue that needed to be addressed by rich countries.  While climate is high on Macron's agenda, the French president has also said he wants to alter the regulation on trade and investment.  Macron needs to be very cautious in shaping his vision of Europe. Right now, he is trying to tighten scrutiny of foreign investment activities in the European Union, which is signing free trade agreements with some of its partners.  For politicians, market protection and protectionism seem very similar but the former is acceptable, while the latter is one step too far. Macron must accept the reality that openness has already benefited his country, the EU and the world by promoting technology transfer, capital injection and inward investment. For the EU, its priority should be to trim bureaucracy, instead of beefing up its regulations.  The US also scrutinizes investment in the name of national security. But this mainly works as a barrier and sometimes a useful card to play.  The EU, a global leader of climate protection, free trade and an open economy, should not follow such old-fashioned practices. What's more, the essence of the Paris Agreement is global development paradigm change, and ample finance and technology transfers from the rich countries can help less-developing countries avoid development traps and environmental woes.  France has played a major role in defending international cooperation on climate change. It should approach trade with the same spirit. If so, the numerous goals in the Paris Agreement could be turned into reality faster than expected.  The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.  fujing@chinadaily.com.cn         "
G20 must put actions to its words if it is to deliver on its consensus,7/11/2017,"                      A comparison of the outcome documents from the G20 summit in Hamburg that concluded on Saturday and those produced at the Washington gathering, the first such meeting between the leaders of the 20 major economies held two months after the fall of financial giant Lehman Brothers in 2008, leads to both encouraging and worrisome observations.  After intensive diplomatic efforts from the team of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, possibly the only leader who has participated in all 12 summits, the topics put on the agenda have gone far beyond risk management, financial market regulation, financial liquidity guarantees and the urgency of reviving economic growth, which were heavily debated at the first summit.  At that time, the major task of the international community was to avoid a dysfunctional global market by engaging with emerging economies such as China to ensure the global financial system remained workable.  During the global economic recession, the most damaging one after the Great Depression in 1929-33, China contributed half of the global economic growth and even now the share of its contribution, according to the International Monetary Fund, stands at around 30 percent.  In return, China has gained some of its due say in international economic governance, and the renminbi has been included in the global currency basket, increasingly swapped at bilateral level and recently even bought by European Central Bank as a reserve currency.  China has taken lead in setting up new multilateral financing platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank based in Beijing and the BRICS bank, or New Development Bank, based in Shanghai. And it proposed and is advancing the Belt and Road Initiative as a way to stimulate global economic growth and make it more inclusive.  China's contribution is shown in the Hamburg documents, and the 15-page declaration and several annexes show consensus was reached on pursuing greater economic openness, free trade, energy and sustainable development, the digital economy, partnership with Africa, health and the empowerment of women.  It gives the impression agreements were reached on everything except climate change, on which the US is at odds with the other members.  Despite this, the outcomes are encouraging. Compared with their vision shown at G20 summit in Washington, it is a big step forward.  However, it is clear there is still a lack of collective global leadership and political trust.  For instance, India is provoking China by sending troops across their border, the US is aggressively displaying its military might in the Asia-Pacific region, the differences between Europe and the US are expanding and also the relations between Russia and the West are unfriendly.  In the documents for the G20 summit in Washington and even those held in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, phrases such as ""refrain from"" were frequently included and most of the G20 members delivered on their words with actions.  Now, it is obvious that such a shared political will is fading. Some members are turning to domestic market protection, geopolitical calculation and a military buildup, instead of finding ways to offer more global public goods to really turn their consensus into reality.  And it is harder for the major powers to reach compromises now. The US once again, similar to its trick with the Kyoto Protocol, confirmed its withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement. That is damaging to international cooperation as every other country believes the biggest economy should be a trustworthy partner and therefore should implement the deal as agreed.  The situation is worrying. If political trust cannot be forged, the spirit of making compromises will not be sustained, and the G20 consensus will be only on paper.

"On China's 'diplomatic chessboard', Germany is an important piece",7/4/2017,"                      On China's diplomatic chessboard the significance of Germany and other European Union member states can be gauged from the frequent visits President Xi Jinping has paid to those countries. In fact, he is due to arrive in Berlin on Tuesday to pay another state visit to Germany, during which he will also attend this year's G20 summit in Hamburg.  China has always attached great importance to Germany.  This is Xi's second state visit to Germany after his previous one in March 2014. What's more, the Chinese president's visit this year follows just one month after Premier Li Keqiang's tour to Germany. And Li also paid a visit to Germany in 2014.  Germany attaches equal importance to China, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has visited China many times during her term in office. Actually, an official in the chancellor's office said Merkel probably doesn't attach such importance to any other country.  Germany is a competitive exporter and manufacturer, and thus an ideal model for China. Its social welfare and market system have been widely debated in China, which is undergoing market-oriented reform. And for decades, Germany has had a big share in China's market. For example, German car brands, such as Volkswagen, Audi, BMW and Mercedes, are omnipresent in China.  And since Chinese investors have just started to explore the opportunities in the high-end product market, Xi is likely to discuss with German leaders how to further boost bilateral ties and become bigger players in each other's markets by removing trade and investment barriers.  Globalization faces increasing challenges, especially with the United Kingdom's departure from the EU and US President Donald Trump's inward-looking policy to ""make America Great Again"", which is nothing but trade protectionism.  Trump has also pulled the United States out of the global climate change agreement, which almost every UN member state welcomed and signed in Paris in 2015.  Germany has been championing free trade, closer global connectivity and remains committed to fighting climate change. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Xi affirmed China's commitment to globalization and free trade, a commitment EU commentators and politicians alike have repeatedly cited and welcomed.  For China, Germany is not only a market but also a platform to explore the entire EU economy. In recent years, Beijing has been viewing Sino-German ties beyond the two countries' markets, whose consumers add up to 1.9 billion.  That's one of the reasons Xi proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. And Germany's positive response to the initiative prompted other EU countries to join it. For example, China initiated the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which many EU countries joined as founding members to explore more opportunities in third-party markets.  Xi's visit to Germany is of great importance to EU-China ties. China has higher hopes of establishing better relations with the EU as a whole.  Xi's visits to Germany and other EU countries indicate China's sincerity in developing closer partnership with the European bloc.  As the host of the G20 summit, a platform where global issues are discussed, Germany needs support to ensure the success of the event. And Xi, who hosted G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou in September last year, is expected to provide that support.

Right time for EU to transform words into action,6/1/2017,"                      Pascale Delcomminette, CEO of Belgium's Walloon Export and Foreign Investment Agency, said in a recent interview that an added advantage of her country's competitiveness is the ability to attract foreign investment. ""We are a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,"" she said with pride in her voice ahead of Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Germany and Belgium from Wednesday to Friday, while highlighting her country' gateway position, mature market, openness and other merits.  While almost all Western European countries followed the United Kingdom in early 2015 in applying to become the founding members of the China-proposed AIIB, Belgium chose not to; it became a member of the new multilateral financial vehicle only in 2017.  Delcomminette wisely cited the AIIB membership as part of Belgium's competitiveness.  And she is not alone in the developed world with such an opinion. Delcomminette's observation enriched my portfolio of findings on how the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative would benefit Europe, following my recent intensive talks with officials and business leaders in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean region. Two points are especially important in this context. Many believe the Belt and Road Initiative has helped them better understand long-term national prosperity and development. They now know national prosperity and development can be achieved by reducing the development gap with Western Europe.  Specifically speaking, they can exploit their countries' geographical and regional advantages by highlighting their closer connectivity to Asia, Europe and Africa.  Therefore, the whole of Europe, both the developed and developing parts, can gain from the colossal game-changing economic development project initiated by China. This is an example of how China is contributing to the global public goods supply chain, and helping shape better and fairer governance dynamics as it further integrates into the global production and investment chain.  Most Europeans have accepted these changes.  There will be new narratives and dialogue contexts at the China-EU leaders' meeting which Premier Li will attend along with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday and Friday. However, to what degree EU leaders recognize this changing paradigm of the world and reflect its member states' collective willingness will determine the outcome of this important meeting, held after the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, the EU-US leaders meeting and the NATO summit in Brussels, and G7 summit in Sicily, Italy.  What's more, examining how the EU has handled its relations with Beijing since last annual leaders' meeting will not allow us much relief. The EU, which globally advocates free trade, has failed to fulfill its commitment to China when the latter joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. The EU has tightened approval procedures for China's outward investment in recent times, though many of the bloc's member states want it. It has also imposed punitive tariffs on China's exports.  European leaders are still dividing the world into ""West and East"", while China advocates ""the shared destiny of humanity"". For example, when meeting US President Donald Trump, Tusk said he aimed to work with Trump to protect the interests and values of the ""free world"". That was a highly suggestive statement from the chief of an organization that is supposed to guide the EU in the right political direction. And a few months ago, in one of his speeches, Tusk even called China a threat.  Tusk's statements show the EU leadership has not fully accepted China as a strategic partner, although it aims to strengthen the EU-China partnership according to a statement on the bloc's website that China welcomes.  But only concrete actions count.  And this is the right time for the EU to seize the ""historic momentum"" to turn words into action, because its member states are eager to engage China in European policies on various fronts.

Brussels visit gives Trump a chance to reset ties with EU,5/23/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump attends a press conference at the White House in Washington DC, on April 12, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Starting with his tightly-scheduled meetings with European Union leaders on Thursday in Brussels, US President Donald Trump and EU leaders are expected to start swirls of bargains on how to reshape the trans-Atlantic partnership and lead the changing world.  Trump, who called Brussels a ""hellhole"" during his election campaign, is expected to arrive in the Belgian capital and EU headquarters amid ""not welcome"" protests in Rome and Brussels on Wednesday, after his whirlwind visits to Israel, Saudi Arabia and a meeting with Pope Francis in Rome.  During his stay in Brussels, he is scheduled to meet the Belgian king and prime minister on Wednesday, take part in a EU-US leaders' meeting, and ""compare opinions"" with new French President Emmanuel Macron over lunch before attending the NATO leaders summit on Thursday afternoon. He will then fly to Italy to attend the G7 summit on Friday and Saturday.  Trump will return to Europe to attend the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in early July, which will provide another opportunity for the EU and US leaders to inject new impetus into their partnership.  The detailed agenda of the discussion between Trump and EU leaders is still unknown. But the pressing and challenging topics cannot be discussed in a day. For example, Trump may discuss about the restart of the talks on Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which would be tricky given that Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a deal that his predecessor Barack Obama had struck with the major Asia-Pacific economies, with the exception of China.  Beijing and Washington put in place an effective mechanism after President Xi Jinping met Trump in April, and it is now necessary for Brussels and Washington to follow suit.  But Trump must know how Europeans view his presidency. Observers in the EU were shocked by his victory in the US presidential election. They are still disappointed with his ""American First"" policy and what they perceive as an inward-looking and unstable governance approach.  Since Trump may still not be clear about the roles of various EU institutions, just like he confused European Council President Donald Tusk with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, he needs to do enough homework to build trust with the EU leaders.  But apart from building mutual trust, the leaders of the two sides should also discuss how the EU and the US, which account for roughly half of the world's economic output, should shoulder more global responsibilities. And while doing so, the two sides should review the lessons learned from the financial and debt crises that originated in the US and the EU, respectively. They must also discuss how to fix their own governance loopholes to prevent the negative effects from spilling over into other economies and thus the global economy.  Domestic economic stability is essential for the US and the EU to take the global leadership, and both economies are back on track. But they now face another problem: political division that has lowered people's interest in the democratic process and domestic politics.  Many say the West is facing its biggest political crisis since the global financial crisis of 2008. Only after Western leaders squarely face up to their economic and political challenges can they take up their global responsibilities in a more constructive manner. And Trump must be cautious enough to not let the US default on its global responsibilities. For example, some EU opinion leaders say that if Trump does not implement the Paris climate pact, the EU will push the rest of the world to enforce it without the US' participation.  For the US to play a better role on the global stage, Trump's European tour can give him a chance to review the trans-Atlantic alliance and reshape future relations.

G7 and G20 summits can take inspiration from Silk Road spirit,5/16/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping chairs the Leaders' Roundtable Summit at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, on May 15, 2017. [Photo by Xu Jingxing/chinadaily.com.cn]      Of all the hundreds of foreign participants at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Sunday and Monday, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Germany's Minister for Economics and Energy Brigitte Zypries could be the key messengers spreading the forum's consensus that tearing the walls apart can achieve common peace and prosperity.  This is simply because Gentiloni, who joined state leaders from across the world in Beijing, will host the G7 summit in the Sicilian town of Taormina on May 26-27 and Germany will be chairing G20 Leaders Meeting in Hamburg on July 7-8.  Zypries attended the forum on behalf of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who could not attend due to a scheduling conflict.  The two countries are certainly busy with agenda-setting for the upcoming summits, and Gentiloni and Zypries will have noted the proposals, solutions and suggestions that are emerging from the two-day gathering in Beijing.  What China is basically proposing with the Belt and Road Initiative is the world should engage in joint consultation and cooperation in pursuit of peace and prosperity, rather than engage in confrontation which only leads to conflict.  This revival of the Silk Road spirit is something the upcoming G7 and G20 summits urgently need to embrace. When their meeting wrapped up on Saturday, the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors failed to adopt a firm stance against protectionism mainly because of the opposition of the United States' representative.  The G20 finance ministers were also not on the same page at their meeting in March as they dropped their commitment to take ""no single protection measure"", a practice adopted in the depth of the global economic recession.  However, it is not just the United States that is taking a protectionist stance. The European Union announced anti-dumping measures against China's exports of pipes and tubes made from steel and iron last week.  The leaders who have gathered in Beijing issued a communique highlighting their consensus to deepen cooperation and build more opportunities by connecting different countries, regions and cultures through better infrastructure, innovative financial tools and encouraging the flow of other productivity elements.  The task of spreading this message falls on Italy and Germany's shoulders when they host the forthcoming summits.  It is true that they are being held at a difficult time, as French President Emmanuel Macron only began his five-year term on Sunday, Donald Trump took office in January and Gentiloni started to lead Italian government last December. British Prime Minister Theresa May is also a new face.  But the leaders should not only spend their time on laying the ""foundations for trust,"" which always appears to be a core task of their gatherings. They now need to be decisive in delivering concrete outcomes.  They must fight against protectionism, collectively learning from the Silk Road spirit that has been evident in Beijing during the Belt and Road Forum. And they must secure the harvest of global efforts to fight against climate change. If so, that will pave the way for the G20 summit in Hamburg, for which, the theme is connectivity.  In many ways, this theme already reflects some of the outcomes of Belt and Road Initiative, and the participants should be encouraged to debate and find ways to achieve not only greater infrastructure connectivity via roads, highways, railways, and ports, but also through financial openness and digital transformation.  On Sunday, the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab called the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China a model for fostering economic development and international cooperation. He plans to deepen the scope of the WEF's debates and discussions by linking the initiative with its research and agenda-setting process on various occasions.  In acting as timely messengers and transforming the world into a better place, Italy and Germany can follow the example set by Schwab and use the Silk Road spirit of peaceful exchanges to guide the G7 and G20 summits.

"Consultation, not a trade war, will settle bilateral disputes",9/13/2018,"                      The trade friction between the United States and China does not signify a tipping point in the Sino-US relationship, experts have said, even though the two countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods.  After the conclusion of the hearings on the US administration's proposal to impose 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports in Washington recently, some US researchers and a top Chinese envoy said they believe cooperation and consultation can resolve the bilateral issues.  ""I would say we're nowhere near a tipping point,"" David Dollar, senior fellow at John L. Thornton China Center, Brookings Institution, said when asked if the world's top two economies, locked in a blistering trade dispute, are approaching a tipping or turning point, as some critics suggest.  ""Let's not forget, there's still a tremendous amount of trade between the US and China, there're 400,000 Chinese students in the US, and there are American tourists going to China... So a little bit of friction does not necessarily mean a turning point,"" Dollar said. ""Hopefully this will be rather temporary, and we'll get back to healthy development of our relationship.""  Dollar, a former US Treasury economic and financial emissary to China, made the remarks on the sidelines of a dialogue at the Brookings Institution on Aug 30 that was attended by US think tank members, a Chinese delegation of researchers and former government officials. ""I've been opposed to these US tariffs right from the start. I don't think these are good instruments,"" Dollar said. ""So for me, a happy solution is China opens up the economy more, and the US pulls back from this trade war.""  At a working lunch at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on the same day, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said Beijing is always ready to engage in ""serious, substantive and pragmatic"" negotiations and consultations to address the economic and trade issues. ""This has to be a process of goodwill for goodwill, and good faith for good faith. If we can reach an agreement through this approach, I don't think the current economic and trade issues would be that difficult (to resolve),"" Cui said.  Emphasizing that the US-China relationship is the most consequential for the 21st century, John Allen, president of the Brookings Institution, said the relationship features four Cs-cooperation, competition, confrontation and conflict. Americans and Chinese should look for ways to cooperate, and there is much they can do together for the good of all humankind, the retired US Marine Corps four-star general said.  ""We should expect that the two great nations… will compete. But if we're wise, we should see in that competition, opportunities, because we're better for the constructive competition over time,"" he said, adding that if any confrontation occurs, the two sides should take measures to defuse it.  While saying he had ""a certain amount of sympathy"" with the Chinese government in dealing with a ""disorganized"" administration like ""the one we have"", Richard Bush, a senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings, stressed that China needs to be clear about what its own policies are and ""take measured actions in response to unreasonable things that the Trump administration does"".  And Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an expert on the Chinese economy, felt US President Donald Trump seemed ""very reluctant"" to give any ground. ""I think until we see more evidence of the cost of his approach on American consumers and American businessmen and American farmers, he's not going to change course,"" Lardy said after a roundtable at the CSIS on Aug 30.  Judging by the experts' and officials' comments, consultation and cooperation-not a trade war-will help resolve the US-China trade conflict.

Kentucky governor sets an example for rest of US to follow in trade with China,8/23/2018,"                          [Photo/IC]   From Iowa farms to Capitol Hill, the anxiety over a looming trade war between China and the United States continues unabated, as the Office of the US Trade Representative started a six-day hearing on Monday on a new round of proposed tariffs on Chinese goods.  What can US states do to reduce the uncertainties and differences between the world's two largest economies?  Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin seems to have an answer: Do whatever is possible within his gubernatorial powers to strengthen ties with China, that is, by encouraging investment.  Bevin, a Republican, also said he would adopt a seemingly detached approach to the trade conflict between China and the US, by using the knowledge he accumulated from his East Asian studies in college. That means he will help people to see what a healthy US-China trade relationship can offer.  ""I would encourage all of us, West, East and otherwise, to understand it's important to be patient to work slowly to realize that we need each other,"" he said. ""America and China are stronger as trading partners… We need each other and want this to work well.""  Bevin invited Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai to visit Kentucky last week for talks, which seem to have yielded tangible results.  At the post-talks news conference, Bevin said the tariffs are set on a level that he doesn't have direct influence on as a governor. So, he said, he cannot spend time worrying about what might happen. ""What I know is I can control from the bottom up, who comes, whom we talk to, and what kind of personal… and business relationships we are establishing to ensure that no matter what happens at this level, we will continue to become stronger and closer, nation to nation and people to people,"" Bevin said.  Bevin cited Kentucky's advantages to Chinese journalists: energy costs and logistics convenience, as well as Kentucky's massive investment in workers' training programs, as he wants to see more Chinese companies investing in his state to create jobs in addition to the nearly 9,000 they have already created.  Cui assured him that Chinese businesses have a strong interest in the US in general, and in Kentucky in particular.  Two days after his meeting with Cui, Bevin announced that Global Win Wickliffe LLC, a Chinese-owned paper products manufacturer, will reopen the former Verso Corp mill in west Kentucky's Ballard County, with a $150 million investment which is expected to create 500 full-time jobs.  To encourage investment and job growth in the community, the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority said on Thursday that it has given the company preliminarily approval to get up to $25 million in tax incentives through the Kentucky Business Investment Program.  Bevin said he would like to see 200 Chinese companies employing Kentucky residents in the next two decades and emphasized that Kentucky's exports to China have a rosy future, not least because China is already Kentucky's fourth-largest trade destination.  Cui added: ""Abraham Lincoln, a native Kentuckian, stands for a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We in China now stress people-centric development. (Fulfilling) people's aspiration for a better life is our goal….""  For Kentucky, the rising number of China's middle income group, equal to almost the entire US population, means a huge market, according to Bevin. He said he would lead a delegation to attend the 2018 China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November. ""It (the Shanghai expo) should excite those of us in the United States, and specifically in Kentucky, that make products, that make goods and services that the world can consume,"" he said.  Perhaps now, with a looming trade war, business communities need to adopt Bevin's pragmatic approach to US-China trade relations. And Bevin's contention that China and the US ""need each other"" and the fact that he wants ""this to work well"" should inspire the rest of the world to follow in his footsteps.

US agriculture says we just can't take any more,8/8/2018,"                      In a rally speech in Tampa, Florida, on July 31, US President Donald Trump defended his trade policies, saying, ""China and others have targeted our farmers.… And you know what our farmers are saying? 'It's OK. We can take it.'""  In tune with his plea made a week before to farmers to ""be a little patient"", Trump continued, ""You're going to make it back and it's going to be made back faster than anybody would know.""  It might be true that some US farmers have thrown their support behind the president in the hope that his brinkmanship would ultimately bring them benefits as promised. But more and more farmers and their lobbyists believe that his tariff tactics are hurting them, and it is more than they ""can take"".  Christopher Gibbs, an Ohio farmer and Trump voter, was quick to point out that the big pie in the sky Trump was promising may never materialize.  ""Hope is not a marketing plan. Hope is not a business plan. And I know you know that,"" Gibbs said in a videoed message to Trump on Aug 2.  In March, the price of soybeans was $10.50 a bushel. Today, it's $8.50 a bushel, down by 20 percent, Gibbs said in the video clip posted on The New York Times.  ""I have to tell you, Mr President, this hurts. This is hurting our long-term future,"" he said. ""Whether it's transportation, whether it's production, whether it's the clerk at the grocery store, when agriculture gets sick, everybody feels that kind of pain.""  China is the US' top market for agricultural products. Taking soybeans alone, China imported 31 percent of US production last year, according to the American Soybean Association statistics.  Gibbs and many analysts believe that the Trump administration's tariff rhetoric serves to only tear down the agricultural markets the US farmers have built over decades, in addition to increasing market uncertainty.  Trump, in a speech in Kansas, Missouri, on July 24, acknowledged the extensive efforts of the US agriculture industry to persuade him to change course. ""They have some of the greatest lobbying teams ever put together,"" he said.  Despite their failure so far to get Trump to change course, these lobbying groups are not giving up.  Farmers for Free Trade, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and expanding export opportunities for American farmers and ranchers, has announced a new, multi-million-dollar campaign ""Tariffs Hurt the Heartland"" to highlight how tariffs are affecting rural America.  ""As farmers head into a harvest and borrowing season that could make or break family farms, they want to know two things: when will this trade war end and when are we going to get back in the business of opening markets to Made-in-America exports?"" Farmers for Free Trade spokesman Scott Henry said on Aug 3, the day China announced additional retaliatory tariffs on US imports including agricultural products in response to the US plan to impose 25 percent tariffs of $200 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports.  Americans for Farmers& Families, another industry group, said China's announcement shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.  ""If trade tensions continue to escalate at this rate, the US and China will inevitably hit a point of no return-upending access to one of the biggest customers of American products in the world and causing irreparable damage to our livelihoods, families and economy,"" Casey Guernsey, spokesman for the group's ""Retaliation Hurts Rural Families"" initiative, said on Aug 3.  There are many stories and statements in a similar vein lamenting the hurt being done to US farmers and ranchers and others by Trumps' trade policy, and they all boil down to the same message: We can't take it.

Washington stands to lose if it drags the tariff dispute for long,7/18/2018,"                      Responding to US Trade Representative statement on Section 301 action on July 10 that proposed imposing hefty tariffs on more Chinese imports, Beijing said the US had overestimated the size of its trade deficit and China is not responsible for it. Instead, the deficit is the result of the low savings rate in the United States, the US dollar serving as the international reserve currency, the two countries' differences over the international division of labor, and the US' restrictions on high-tech exports to China, the Ministry of Commerce said.  There is, however, another reason for the US' ""massive"" trade deficit with China, say some US researchers, who believe that ""trade hawks"" in the Donald Trump administration have deliberately exaggerated the trade deficit figure by excluding US service exports, and that has its own risks.  At a March 23 news conference, Trump famously said: ""Last year, we lost $500 billion on trade with China."" That was fake news, said Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank. ""The correct number was $335.7 billion once we count the $40.2 billion US surplus in services,"" Reynolds said, adding that if the $35 billion trade deficit Hong Kong had with the US were included-and rightly so, as Hong Kong is part of China-the US' trade deficit with the Chinese mainland-Hong Kong combined would be $300.6 billion in 2017, $200 billion less than what Trump claimed.  There's no excuse for not counting services when calculating trade, as the US is predominantly a service economy. Rising US service exports accounted for one-third of the total exports from January through May, and the US surplus in services shrunk the total deficit by 31 percent, Reynolds said, citing US Census Bureau data.  Private services accounted for 69 percent of the US' gross domestic product and 128.2 million jobs in June, while goods-producing industries together accounted for only 20.7 million jobs in June, the researcher wrote in an analytical report last week. ""When President Trump and his trade war generals talk excitedly about bilateral trade deficits, they invariably talk only about goods-never services,"" Reynolds said.  US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, for example, published an article titled Free Trade Is a Two-Way Street in The Wall Street Journal, writing only about ""trade in goods"" as though a third of US exports, the majority of US jobs and 69 percent of GDP are not worth mentioning.  In an interview with China Daily, Reynolds said that some US news reports often include the service sector when reporting on the overall trade balance, but exclude services when discussing trade with specific countries, such as China. For example, The New York Times reported on Feb 6 that: ""The gap between Chinese goods imported to the United States and American goods exported to China rose to $375.2 billion last year, up from $347 billion the prior year . . . The overall United States trade deficit in goods and services with the world widened 12.1 percent to $566 billion last year, the largest gap since 2008.""  Why were services included in the statistics on world trade but not in the data on trade with China? Reynolds said the writer and editor were either statistically ignorant or they deliberately tried to make the report more sensational by using the largest available figure. ""President Trump and others who are mistakenly troubled by trade deficits with specific countries should at least get the facts straight,"" he said.  Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, too, said Trump is focusing on products that one can touch and feel-in other words, merchandise trade.  ""This makes no sense, since the US is very strong in service exports, and his own business is a service firm,"" said Hufbauer, who earlier served the US Treasury as deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy. ""But his political identity is with manufacturing workers, so it helps his case to just cite merchandise trade numbers,"" Hufbauer said.  The US surplus with China in services has increased by a staggering 25-fold from 2003 to 2017, according to US official statistics.  The US-ignited trade conflict with China risks sapping the momentum of the US service economy, Hufbauer said, because China may decide to restrict US service companies from doing business in China as part of its retaliatory measures. ""This will be unfortunate both for the firms and for China,"" he said.  Both Reynolds and Hufbauer said the Trump administration is ""missing the mark"" by hiking tariffs to protect the manufacturing industries and jobs, while ignoring the ""indisputable fact"" that the private service sector has accounted for the long-term growth of US employment over several decades.  Although the current US trade surplus with China in services may appear relatively small, it has increased from $1.7 billion in 2007 to $40.2 billion in 2017. If it continues doubling every five years, as it has over the past five years, it could reach $80 billion by 2022 and $160 billion by 2027, Reynolds said.  But what if the trade relations between the world's top two economies continue to deteriorate?  It will be the US' loss.  The author is deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily USA.         "
US will soon realize the folly of a tariff war,7/12/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   It is unwise to predict if the burgeoning tariff war between the world's top two economies will be a short or protracted fight, given the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump. That is because after the US midterm elections in November, the economic impact of Trump's approach could become clearer.  Making good on his threat to levy punitive duties on imports for the benefit of the US economy, the Trump administration proposed 10 percent tariffs on thousands of Chinese products worth $200 billion on Tuesday, following hefty duties imposed on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6.  Last week, the Bank of England, Britain's central bank, forecast that further escalation in the trade dispute, or a 10 percentage-point rise in tariffs between the US and all of its trading partners, could chip 2.5 percent off US output and 1 percent off global economic output.  David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's John L. Thornton China Center, also said things are more likely to change only after the midterm elections. ""Protectionism will be bad for the US economy, but it will take some time for this effect to become evident,"" Dollar told China Daily. ""After that (midterm elections) there is more chance for the two sides to negotiate a truce,"" he said, and cautioned that the US could lose substantially if Trump stretches the trade conflict.  ""It (China) is gradually opening up more sectors of its economy, such as automobiles and financial services. If the US persists in the trade war, then American firms are likely to be shut out as China opens up,"" he wrote in an article on July 6. ""Do not be surprised if in 2019 the US takes the offer that has been on the table, dressing it up a bit in order to declare victory,"" Dollar said, referring to China's earlier offer to buy more agricultural produce, and energy and high-tech products. The offer was invalidated because of the US move to implement tariffs.  Trump's job approval rating stood at 41 percent at the end of last week, down from 45 percent in the week ended on June 17, according to Gallup. His support among his own party remains strong, though. But if the tariff and counter-tariff ripple hurts the US, which it will, Trump's supporters may eventually get tired of all this ""winning"", columnist Catherine Rampell said.  ""It is no coincidence that so many Trump-voting areas will suffer,"" Rampell wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on June 25. That is because placing tariffs on intermediate goods such as steel and aluminum will hurt the downstream manufacturers that buy those materials and that employ more ""Trump country"" workers than the US steel and aluminum industries do, Rampell said. Another reason is that the US' furious trading partners are ""deliberately"" targeting industries located in politically sensitive areas, she said.  Some US companies are already pulling back investments in equipment and jobs ""as a result of uncertainty over trade policy"", according to the minutes of the Federal Reserve Board's June 12-13 meeting, which were released on July 5. Even in the steel and aluminum industries, producers were not planning new investments to increase their capacity, the Fed reported.  ""Trump is convinced that his neo-protectionist policies are somehow winning the day, when, in reality, they aren't,"" said Jon Taylor, a professor of political science at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. ""I'm hopeful that the solution will be that both sides will, after a brief period of reciprocal tariffs, back away from them,"" Taylor told China Daily.  The likely solution would be to recognize that both sides' interests are best served by engaging in negotiations, negotiations that are in good faith and recognize that while differences will always be a part of China-US relations, there are diplomatic solutions to prevent conflict, Taylor said.  One couldn't agree more.  The author is deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily USA.  huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com         "
US bike maker's decision exposes another ugly side of Trump policy,6/28/2018,"                          Tariffs on motorcycles Harley-Davidson exported from the US to Europe, its second-largest market, jumped from 6 percent to 31 percent. [Photo/IC]   US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson's announcement on Monday that it would move more production out of the United States is the latest reminder that the US' unilateral measures to increase tariffs is causing self-inflicted wounds.  The Wisconsin-based company, which US President Donald Trump called a ""true American icon"" and thanked for ""building things in America"" at a meeting last February, said it will implement a plan to shift the production of motorcycles for export to the European market from US factories to plants overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs.  The decision came a few days after the European Union rolled out tariffs on $3.4 billion of US goods, including motorbikes, in retaliation to US barriers on imports of European steel and aluminum, which in turn prompted Trump to threaten more duties on European cars.  Tariffs on motorbikes Harley-Davidson exported from the US to the Europe, its second-largest market, jumped from 6 percent to 31 percent, resulting in an average additional cost of $2,200 per bike, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. It added that increasing production outside of the US to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company's preference, ""but represents the only sustainable option"". The company's shares closed nearly 6 percent down on Monday.  Trump responded saying he was ""surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag"". ""Taxes just a Harley excuse-be patient!"" he tweeted.  Experts following the US' escalating trade spat with the EU and other economies are not surprised by Harley-Davidson's decision. Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize for economics and renowned columnist, said what happened to the iconic bike company will happen tomorrow to ""a lot of other businesses"".  ""Yes, the US runs a trade deficit. But commerce still estimates that more than 10 million jobs are supported by exports, and many will be put at risk, so will jobs in many US companies that rely on imported inputs,"" Krugman tweeted on Monday.  Chad P. Bown, Reginald Jones senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the costs to the US of its own trade policy actions are accumulating. ""Trump's tariffs on inputs like steel, aluminum, or the hundreds of 'parts' on the Section 301 list feed into US production, frequently through cross-border supply chains,"" he said. ""Raising the prices of intermediate inputs raises the costs to downstream US industries and makes American firms less competitive both in the North American and global markets.""  Trump's tariff on steel imports has caused Mid Continent Nail Corporation in Missouri, the largest such enterprise in the US, to lose about half of its business in two weeks. ""The company employing 500 people earlier this month has laid off 60 temporary workers. It could slash 200 more jobs by the end of July and be out of business around Labor Day (Sept 3),"" Missourinet.com reported on Friday.  On June 20, German automaker Daimler AG said it had lowered its 2018 earnings outlook, a change that it says is partly due to increased import tariffs on US vehicles in China. Daimler manufactures vehicles in the US.  Harley-Davidson is the latest example of how businesses are finding themselves in the crosshairs of the trade disputes between the US and its major trade partners. It also proves that winning a trade war isn't that easy. More businesses, consumers and farmers in the EU, China and, without doubt, the US are likely to feel the brunt of the tit-for-tat tariffs.  Commenting on the ""strong concern domestically"" in the US because of Trump's trade policy, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman said on June 21: ""China hopes the United States can take seriously the voices of all parties and get back on the right track.""  With the dominant US bike maker shifting production out of the US, it is time for US policymakers to stop taking reckless measures and to move cautiously and rationally ahead.

"DPRK, US must now build on consensus reached in Singapore",6/14/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un sign documents in Singapore in this photo released on Tuesday by the DPRK's Korean Central News Agency. KCNA VIA REUTERS   The just-concluded Singapore summit in which a sitting US president met face-to-face with the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the first time was a major step toward the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.  Whether the promises and consensus made during the meeting on Tuesday were more about headlines than substantive progress will depend on how the US, the DPRK and other stakeholders maintain the diplomatic momentum set in motion by the summit and whether they can produce some early results.  The major tests are whether US President Donald Trump will halt the joint war games held with the Republic of Korea as promised, and how the sanctions will be addressed.  In their joint statement, the DPRK and the United States said they are committed to establishing a new relationship, and that the DPRK will work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while the US will provide security guarantees to the DPRK.  At the news conference after the summit, Trump said that his top aides would meet with DPRK officials next week for further nuclear talks.  The immediate follow-up discussions are good to add meat to the bones of a joint statement which some critics lament lacks specifics. But as Abraham Denmark of the Wilson Center in Washington tweeted, ""Where there is diplomacy there is hope.""  It's also laudable that Trump said he wants China's involvement in the signing of a peace treaty to replace the current armistice agreement that halted the 1950-53 Korean War. He did not specify when it will happen.  But when it comes to his offer of stopping war games, there is actually a time element attached to it.  Trump said, ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should. But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, I think it's (the military exercise) very provocative.""  The annual US-ROK military drills are carried out twice in spring and fall. The autumn military exercises are scheduled for August.  Pyongyang has consistently denounced the drills as a dress rehearsal for an invasion.  The springtime joint military drills were delayed and conducted in April to help create a favorable atmosphere for the Winter Olympics hosted by the ROK in February, to which the DPRK sent a delegation. However, the DPRK suspended high-level talks planned with the ROK in protest of the war games.  It is true that Trump will have to steer clear of being swayed by different opinions from politicians and military officials in Washington and beyond, some of whom claimed they were caught off-guard by Trump's decision, and that the ""routine and defensive"" joint drills are part of the core of the US-ROK alliance.  The US-DPRK statement said that the two sides recognize ""mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"". Both Pyongyang and Washington could follow up with actions to increase confidence building.  While the DPRK is expected, in Trump's words, to start the process of the denuclearization of Korean Peninsula ""very, very quick"", the US president will also have to deliver on his promise regarding security guarantees, with the halting of military drills being a concrete step.  There also are concerns about economic sanctions.  The negotiations following the summit must produce some early results or ""wins"" in order for all parties to place faith and political capital in the process, Victor Cha, a senior adviser and the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow with the CSIS Korea Chair, said on Tuesday.  They said that for the DPRK, early results in terms of the lifting of sanctions will be sought, as well as progress on defining a path to peaceful and normalized political relations.  Earlier on Tuesday, Kim said he and Trump had ""decided to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change"".  It is unclear what specifically is ""the past"" to leave behind, but it most probably includes the tensions and animosity between the two sides, and the confrontational rhetoric and behaviors that intensify the animosity.  Trump on Tuesday said he has held off imposing new sanctions, and the current sanctions will remain in place and will come off when the DPRK's nuclear weapons ""are no longer a factor"".  It is noteworthy that China has long proposed a ""dual suspension"" whereby the DPRK suspends its weapons tests, and the US and the ROK suspend their military drills, which is becoming closer to a reality.  It now supports adjusting the sanctions according to how the DPRK behaves.  ""The relevant (United Nations) Security Council resolutions stipulate that we shall adjust sanction measures as may be needed in light of the DPRK's compliance, including suspending or lifting relevant sanction measures,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing on Tuesday.  Let's hope the US and the DPRK will continue to meet each other half way and ultimately reach the goals that they, as well as the international community, wish to see.

Kim and Trump can usher in an era of peace and prosperity,6/7/2018,"                      On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump tweeted, ""Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big ... we will soon see!"" By giving a specific time-9 am-for the planned June 12 summit between Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, the White House seems intent on following through on the historic summit. However impulsive Trump may have been when he agreed in early March to the summit, he has now come to realize that the anticipated one-on-one with Kim is just the beginning of the ""process"" of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, meaning rapid denuclearization is unlikely. Perhaps this realization is what made Trump put new sanctions against the DPRK on hold on Friday. Asked if the DPRK had agreed to ""complete, verifiable and irreversible"" dismantlement of its nuclear sites and program, Trump said: ""We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12, and we never were."" Thus he downplayed the expectations from the summit which he had abruptly canceled just few days ago. ""We're going to start a process... but I think they'd like to see something happen."" Shortly after his meeting with Kim Yongchol, vice-chairman of the DPRK's ruling Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, Trump told reporters that he was putting new sanctions against Pyongyang on hold and doesn't want to use the term ""maximum pressure"" anymore. ""We're getting along, so it's not a question of maximum pressure,"" Trump said. ""And at a certain point, I'll tell you what, I look forward to the day when I can take the sanctions off North Korea."" A day before his meeting with the DPRK envoy, Trump had said it could take several meetings to reach an agreement. In Pyongyang, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Friday that Kim Jong-un hoped US-DPRK relations will improve and denuclearization of the peninsula will be achieved on a ""stage-by-stage"" basis. After the turbulence and drama surrounding the on-again, off-again Trump-Kim summit, it is perhaps safe to say the two leaders are now on the same page on at least one aspect-there is no quick fix to denuclearization. Which is important because realizing that denuclearizing takes time will make people more rational about what to expect from the first Trump-Kim meeting days before it opens. It also allows deliberation on what steps to take before the summit and during the critical period afterward. On Monday, top Democrats in the US Senate told Trump not to make a deal that leaves the DPRK with nuclear weapons. They threatened to maintain or toughen sanctions on Pyongyang if that condition was not met. The White House, too, said that ""powerful sanctions"" will continue unless the DPRK is denuclearized. Because denuclearization faces a long and bumpy road, it is time to think what would be a more realistic approach-easing of sanctions only after full denuclearization, or easing them step-by-step so that Pyongyang can get some benefits in due course? Pyongyang has stopped its nuclear and missile tests, demolished a nuclear test site, released three American prisoners and Kim has held a second meeting with ROK President Moon Jae-in in the run-up to the planned summit. Trump's offer of keeping on hold new sanctions is a good gesture. And given the long-term goal and the efforts needed to achieve it, it is important for the two countries to continue meeting each other halfway, with sincerity, so they can achieve what they and the international community hope for. For their efforts could ultimately usher in a new era for the peninsula, one of denuclearization, peace and prosperity.

China will import only what it needs,5/24/2018,"                          Imports from the US are seen at a supermarket in Shanghai, April 3, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   In the joint statement issued after the US-China trade talks on May 17-18, China pledged to significantly increase purchases of US goods and services. But there is a caveat to such a commitment: the products and services from the US, or any other country, must be those that Chinese people are willing to buy.  This means China will not buy additional US products and services it does not need, nor is China likely to switch purchases from other countries to the US.  This piece of information came at a news briefing in Washington on Saturday morning, hours before the joint statement was released. Speaking to the media toward the end of what he said was a ""positive, pragmatic, constructive and productive"" visit to Washington, Vice-Premier Liu He said China and the US reached consensuses on economic and trade issues and pledged to not engage in a trade war.  Liu said China, with a large middle-income population, will become the world's largest market. ""The Chinese market will be highly competitive; nations longing for the market have to improve the competitiveness of their products and services so that the Chinese people are willing to buy (them),"" he added.  Earlier, Liu said the number of China's middle-income earners had reached 400 million and is still growing. China's economy has been transitioning to high-quality development, and the country will expand its domestic market and increase imports to meet the needs of its people, economy and national development.  Liu also said the products and services exported to China must attract Chinese consumers, adding that the country is ready to buy goods not only from the United States but also from other economies.  Liu's remarks are likely to soothe those who fear that the latest China-US consensuses will come at the expense of some other exporters to China, including its trade partners in Europe and Asia.  The China-US joint statement said the two countries agreed on the need for ""effective measures"" to reduce the US trade deficit in goods with China and ""meaningful increases"" in US exports of agricultural and energy products.  As increasing imports from the US does not mean decreasing exports from China, the agreement is expected to take bilateral trade to a higher level. The US is aiming high. In one of a series of tweets on Monday, US President Donald Trump said, ""Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.""  And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who led the US delegation to the talks with China, said on Sunday that the US expects to see an increase of 35 to 40 percent in agricultural exports to China this year alone and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years.  China is the US' largest export market outside North America. In 2016, the US had a trade surplus in agricultural products of $16.4 billion, according to a report issued by the Ministry of Commerce in May last year. But neither Mnuchin nor the Chinese delegation specified a numerical target for cutting the trade gap with China. After all, the market will play a major role in deciding the size of US exports to China.  China and the US are highly interdependent when it comes to trade. The US has a huge advantage in sectors such as energy, agriculture, high-tech and medical and financial services, all of which China has huge demands for.  In business, nobody likes to have deals imposed on them, nor does anybody like barriers for high-tech exports. In the joint statement, Beijing and Washington agreed to continue high-level engagement and to seek to address their economic concerns in a proactive manner.  Let us hope the two largest economies in the world will lead by example by continuing their win-win cooperation, which China is seeking with its other business partners, too.

"In US, national and personal progress are different things",5/17/2018,"                      To most Chinese, Barshefsky is not a name easy to pronounce. But a woman by that name and her flowing silk scarves are well known in China. I have met Charlene Barshefsky, former US chief trade negotiator, several times in Washington, and each time I saw her wearing one of her trademark scarves, which earlier reports said often ""brightened up"" the sometimes dull conference rooms during the talks leading up to China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.  That she has impressed the Chinese people is well known. But I always wondered what impressed her most about China. I got the answer the other day at a forum in Washington, where she shared a story that, she said, exemplified the Chinese people's aspirations.  The friendliness of the Chinese people is a soothing reward each time she lands in China after a ""painfully long flight"", Barshefsky said. ""For many years I'm recognized, and even today people ask me for my autograph…""  One day she was walking down a street, and a couple with their little son were walking toward her. As the family came close, she heard a man ask ""Barshefsky"" in the way Chinese pronounce her name. After Barshefsky said yes, the father asked if he could take a picture of her.  ""Then he took my arm and he waited till someone passed who spoke English, and as translated by this lovely fellow who stopped, he said, 'I wanted to thank you. My son will have a better life',"" Barshefsky said, appreciating his politeness and how an average Chinese would anticipate the opportunities arising from the country's entry into the WTO.  ""I'll never forget this,"" Barshefsky said. It was the moment she realized the Chinese, too, have common aspirations, including a better life for their children. ""He knew what WTO meant…This was completely astonishing to me, he equated economic improvements with personal improvements,"" she said.  That equation is what's missing in the United States, where economic improvement of the country is no longer viewed as personal improvement, she said. It is partly because of the absence of domestic policy measures to distribute US national wealth in a more equitable way, whether through better education, retraining or other measures, which would equate the rest of the country with national growth, she said.  ""But this gentleman simply equated economic improvement with personal improvement…,"" she said. And in China, ""this is the case-there's been extraordinary degrees of improvement in the lives of the people"".  Since China joined the WTO, its economy has steadily expanded. Vice-Premier Liu He, who is in Washington this week for trade talks, announced at the 2018 World Economic Forum that the number of China's middle-income earners had reached 400 million and is still growing.  Barshefsky said the encounter many years ago, ""sticks with me"" more than anything else on the WTO side or the negotiations she participated in between 1997 and 2001 as chief trade negotiator. ""Because it's always important to be reminded that the ultimate aspirations most people in the world have are pretty much the same,"" she said.  Indeed, Chinese people invariably aspire for a better life. As pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping in his address to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, ""Not only have their material and cultural needs grown, their demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, security and a better environment are increasing.""  Barshefsky also said she understood the aspirations of China. ""I think China has extraordinary aspirations; it should. It's a great nation,"" she said, adding that the question is how those aspirations are manifested, including with respect to the interests of the nation's strategic and trading partners.  Perhaps it will take several additional trips to China for Barshefsky to get the answers about how those yearnings are being fulfilled.

"US no longer 'confident, optimistic and open'",5/3/2018,"                          Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai briefs media during a news conference on Trump's upcoming visit to China in Washington DC, Oct 30, 2017. [Photo by Zhao Huanxin/chinadaily.com.cn]   Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, is puzzled by the change in a country where he has lived and worked for many years. ""Is the America I used to know-an open, confident, optimistic America-still there?"" he said in a speech at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on April 17.  What perplexes Cui also seems to be confounding many others, especially those who plan to visit the US, or study or do business there.  As China's longest-serving ambassador to the US, where he was once a student and UN employee, Cui is puzzled by Washington's anti-globalization moves-from pulling out of global agreements such as the Paris climate pact to imposing steep tariffs on imports-which many deem as the US administration's disdain for multilateralism.  Addressing a gathering in Chicago that a day after his Harvard speech, Cui said in today's globalized world, no country alone can seize all the global opportunities and meet all the global challenges. Nor can a country prosper in isolation.  ""But now we see policies that attempt to close the door and resort to unilateralism,"" he said. ""And to succeed in today's world, the best choice is to take a win-win approach. But now we see policies that are so strongly influenced by the zero-sum mentality as well as policies that regard other people's success as their losses.""  Cui came to the US in 1981 to serve as an interpreter at the UN Secretariat and pursued postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1986. China's ambassador to the US since 2013, Cui has also served as the ambassador to Japan and China's vice-foreign minister, according to the Chinese embassy's website.  ""What I (have) learned in the US has changed my life, my work and my perception of the world to a great extent,"" he said. ""And the influence has been quite positive."" Many in the media based in Washington agree that Cui is a no-nonsense diplomat, never skirting questions from reporters.  Partly because of his experience at Johns Hopkins University, Cui refuted some US politicians' allegations that Chinese students and scholars, as well as the Confucius Institutes that teach Chinese and culture, posed a threat to US national security.  More than 350,000 Chinese students were studying in the US in the 2016-17 academic year, according to the latest figures of Project Atlas, a global research initiative on student mobility.  Cui said Chinese students come to the US to learn from its universities, teachers, and local classmates. ""I wonder… why some fear the influence of Chinese students in the US while China is not worried that these students may be subject to the impact of the US society,"" Cui said. ""Why some US politicians are… lacking confidence?""  John Delaney, president of the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, had a similar view on the influence of college campus.  But in early February, US Senator Marco Rubio sent an open letter to the UNF and several other Florida schools, saying Confucius Institutes use the teaching of Chinese language and culture as a tool to spread China's political influence, and asking them to sever their ties with the institutes.  However, Delaney said the Confucius Institute on the UNF campus has prompted no complaints, so he sees no reason to discontinue it, the Florida Times-Union reported on Feb 6. ""The institutes' two Chinese instructors do not teach political science; they teach Chinese languages and without them, the university would offer fewer Chinese language courses,"" Delaney said. ""Frankly, I think Jacksonville and America have a bigger influence on them (the Chinese instructors) now that they are here.""  Since mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples, especially the younger generation, will determine the future of China-US relations, let us hope newcomers to the US are not puzzled like Cui as the US changes for the better and becomes ""an open, confident, optimistic"" country again in the future.

'Understanding deficit' biggest risk,4/27/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   With the world talking about the impact of, and solutions to, a possible trade war between China and the US, a senior Chinese diplomat cautioned that an ""understanding deficit"" is greater risk for the two countries than their trade deficit.  Cui Tiankai, China's top envoy to Washington, has on many occasions said that the large trade deficit between the world's top two economies is owing to many factors, including the US' economic structure, low savings rate and high-tech export restrictions.  Delivering a speech at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on April 17, Cui said that although some people want to make the trade deficit a big issue, the ""understanding deficit"" is more significant, more difficult to balance and ""may have negative impact that lasts longer if we don't make our best efforts to reduce it"".  ""Understanding deficit"" is a term used by Michael Szonyi, Fairbank Center director and professor of Chinese history, in his introduction to a new book, The China Questions, in which he said: ""We might even say that just as the United States has a trade deficit with China, it also has an understanding deficit.""  One of the foremost concerns of Cui, China's longest-serving ambassador to the United States, is about the ""new era"", a term that has caught global attention. The ""new era"" is domestically focused, rather than a geostrategic plan. It prefers quality over quantity in economic development, and also takes into account political, cultural, social and ecological aspects.  The new era has some outward-looking aspects, though, because China's development has to keep pace with global trends, Cui said. But as he said: ""This is certainly not a plan for securing world dominance, it is certainly not a Chinese new era to replace the old American era.""  Another ""gross misinterpretation of China's intention"" lies in the US' recent labeling of China as a ""revisionist power"" attempting to overturn the existing world order, Cui said. China has religiously followed the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter, from honoring sovereign equality of the UN member states and peacefully settling disputes to not interfering in other countries' internal affairs.  By contrast, cases of violating these principles are not rare, Cui said. For example, some countries have frequently used force or threatened to use force to violate the sovereignty of other countries, launched wars without the UN Security Council authorization, and even defied the Security Council to unleash chaos and bloodshed in the name of ""humanitarian intervention"".  ""The very people who are responsible for all this are now pointing the finger at others as a revisionist country."" Cui said. ""I think it is high time for us to review and reaffirm these basic principles so that we could have a better and more effective international order.""  Cui also refuted US President Donald Trump's claim that China has stolen American jobs. US jobs have been lost because of the ""global resource allocation of US companies, who seek the best for their interests"", Cui said in a speech at the Wharton China Summit in Philadelphia on April 15.  Between 2001 and 2017, US gross domestic product doubled, meaning the US' overall social benefits have vastly increased, Cui said. But even so the living standards of many Americans have dropped. ""This is obviously a domestic problem, an issue caused by management,"" he said.  Cui also rebutted accusations that Chinese academics working in the US might be covertly gathering intelligence for the Chinese government, calling the charge ""baseless"".  Thus what urgently needs to be addressed is Washington's ""understanding deficit"" with Beijing rather than its trade deficit. Promoting better, deeper, and more realistic mutual understanding between the two countries is in their mutual interest as well as in the interests of the world.

Will Trump heed the call of US farmers to reduce trade deficits?,4/18/2018,"                      The US farming sector is caught in the crossfire of an emerging trade war between the world's top two economies. As US President Donald Trump considers increasing farm subsidies to compensate farmers for the expected decline in their exports and incomes once the US imposes the proposed tariffs on Chinese imports, representatives of the prime agricultural states and lobbying groups declared they prefer ""trade to aid"". On April 5, Trump proposed punitive tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese imports, in addition to the proposed tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods two days earlier. In response, China announced 25 percent tariffs on imports of US airplanes, automobiles, and soybean, sorghum and other agricultural products. Even before China's announcement, US farm income had been ""trending downward over an eight-year period"", as Trump put it last Monday. And US Senator Pat Roberts told PBS NewsHour on Thursday: ""Mother Nature hasn't been very good to us either."" Overall, US net farm income is expected to drop by 6.7 percent to $59.5 billion this year, the lowest since 2006, according to a US Department of Agriculture release. Roberts, who is also chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, was among a group of mostly Midwest lawmakers who met with Trump on the trade issue on Thursday. ""There was a proposal that was at least floated… billions of dollars in aid to offset any tariff retaliation,"" the Republican from Kansas told PBS after the meeting. ""Everybody there insisted and really made their point to the president that we wanted trade, not aid."" Another Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, had issued a statement a day earlier on what he said were ""misguided plans to spend billions of dollars on new subsidy programs during a poorly conceived, tariffs-first trade war"". ""This administration proposal is Saturday-morning-cartoon central planning. We want more trade, not less,"" Sasse said, adding that the farmers want to feed the world and win with trade. And Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds was quoted by axios.com as saying farmers don't want welfare; they want to ""work and win"". Moreover, a coalition of 107 trade groups spoke as one on the issue. In a letter to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the business coalition, including the American Soybean Association, made it clear that subsidies are not a long-term solution. ""While they may provide short-term relief-depending on existing legal authorities-the long-term costs of losing a market will be exponential,"" the letter said. Last year, the US shipped 32.85 million metric tonnes of soybean worth $12 billion-or 62 percent of its total soybean exports-to China, according to earlier media reports. The letter also said the US farmers and exporters cannot easily find new buyers for their products: ""Once a market is lost, and a buyer shifts to a foreign competitor, even if only for a short period of time, future US exports and sales likely will be lost as well."" Compared with the unfavorable weather, the pressure of the looming tariffs and the unpredictability of Trump's policies are a greater threat to the US farmers. Compounding the matter is the failure of the Trump administration to release any information on how Washington plans to help the farmers. Interestingly, Trump has said US farmers are ""great patriots"" and he can't tolerate the trade deficits with China. So wouldn't it be good if the US farmers display their patriotism by helping to narrow the trade deficits with China? That is also what is sought by John Heisdorffer, president of ASA, which lobbies for 21,000 US producers of soybean. ""Soybean farmers want to be an essential part of helping lower our trade deficit with China,"" Heisdorffer said at a congressional hearing on Thursday. ""We believe that expanding market access can play a vital role in increasing our agricultural trade surplus."" But will Trump pay heed to the call of US farmers?

A 'mellowed' Trump no reason for Beijing to be complacent,4/14/2018,"                      As trade tensions ratchet up between the world's two largest economies with US President Donald Trump directing the US Trade Representative last week to identify Chinese goods worth $100 billion for additional tariffs, some academics are trying to explain the chaos. Economic globalization is at a crossroads, with trade protectionism and unilateralism on the rise, Jon Taylor, a professor of political science at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas, said on Tuesday. As Trump moves the US away from global institutional rules, President Xi Jinping's vision, re-emphasized at the Boao Forum for Asia on Tuesday, promotes China's alignment with globalization principles, principles the US appears to be abandoning, Taylor said. While some other analysts have said the US' actions will not resolve the trade conflict, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the 2001 winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, stressed: ""The trade skirmish between the US and China on steel, aluminum, and other goods is a product of… Trump's scorn for multilateral trade arrangements and the World Trade Organization, an institution that was created to adjudicate trade disputes."" Trump's instruction to the USTR comes after the US administration announced additional tariffs on Chinese imports worth $50 billion on April 3, which forced China to respond by slapping 25 percent tariffs on US soybeans, corn, airplanes and automobiles. And although China has filed ""a request for consultation"" with the US under the WTO dispute settlement framework, it has made clear it will not hesitate to strike back against the protectionist moves. ""China's response has been firm and measured, aimed at avoiding both escalation and appeasement, which, when dealing with an unhinged bully, only encourages more aggression,"" Stiglitz said in a Project Syndicate article on Thursday. Stiglitz, who is also a former World Bank chief economist, is among those experts who believe reducing imports from China is not likely to create jobs in the US-rather it will increase prices for US consumers and create jobs in countries that step in to replace the imports from China. According to experts, 37 percent of US imports from China are intermediate products, which American companies use in order to become more competitive. ""Putting tariffs on intermediate products is shooting oneself in the foot,"" says an analytical study titled ""Why a trade war with China would hurt the US and its allies, too"" by David Dollar, a senior fellow at John L. Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution, and Wang Zhi, director of Research Center of Global Value Chains at the University of International Business and Economics. On the other hand, Stiglitz emphasized: ""Even if Trump had no economists advising him, he would have to realize that what matters is the multilateral trade deficit, not bilateral trade deficits with any one country."" Moreover, calling China a pillar of the multilateral system, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said trade wars are bad not only for those involved but also for the global economy. The international framework governing global trade is of extreme importance, with the WTO at its center, he said in New York on April 6, adding: ""Free trade is a very important contributor to global prosperity."" And Marie Kasperek, associate director of the global business and economics program at the Atlantic Council, argued that Trump's focus on pure trade deficits is insufficient a reason and imprudent a way to evaluate Sino-US trade relations. ""After all, a trade deficit simply describes a situation in which domestic investment is bigger than national savings,"" she said. While Kasperek said it was hard to predict how the situation would develop, the good news is that nothing is set in stone yet. That may be true, as Trump softened his tone in his Sunday tweet, saying, ""President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade."" But the fact that he also tweeted, ""China will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do"", shows his mellowed tone could be just a ploy, given his known ""scorn for multilateral trade arrangements and the WTO"".

US politicians must realize institutes aren't political tools,3/28/2018,"                      Confucius Institutes in the United States. [Photo/VCG]   There seem be two types of Confucius Institutes in the United States: those that are hailed on more than 100 campuses as a bridge to learning the Chinese language and culture, and those that are labeled by some newspapers and websites as a ""political tool"" of China.  The US media's ""flawed assumption"" has contributed to such confusion, according to a senior China expert in Washington. There have been many such reports in recent weeks following two US lawmakers' letters urging a handful of schools to sever ties with the Confucius Institute. The lawmakers and media outlets have accused the programs of being a tool to expand the ""political influence of China"" and distort academic discourse in the US.  ""There's a lot of assumptions and innuendo I find in the reporting,"" said David Shambaugh, director of China Policy Program at George Washington University. ""One assumption is that a Confucius Institute somehow affects the curriculum of Chinese studies the way China is taught on campus. Absolutely wrong,"" the professor of political science said.  Shambaugh made the remarks at a discussion at the Brookings Institution early this month. He said he has followed the Confucius Institute closely since one was set up on George Washington University in 2013. ""There's a complete firewall between Confucius Institutes that teach language and...-the rest of the faculty and the curriculum on every university campus, not just at GW, across the country,"" he said. ""So they have no impact on how Chinese studies are taught, so that's a flawed assumption that a lot of journalists leap to. They tend to take a couple of anecdotal cases and string it together and say here's a case.""  Speaking at the same discussion, US Congressman Rick Larsen said: ""Confucius Institutes aren't what they are cracked up to be."" They are trying to influence decisions and they ""aren't as open-minded as what you ought to find in US academia"".  Before Larsen, US Senator Marco Rubio urged schools in his state of Florida to close their Confucius Institutes last month. And Seth Moulton, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, sent a letter to Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in his state early this month, urging them to disassociate with the institute's programs.  But Shambaugh said: ""I'm of a different view than Congressman Larsen. I see them as quite benign and devoted to their primary mission of teaching language and cultural studies while at least speaking, whether it's film, cooking, tai chi, whatever… I thus far don't see evidence that they are being politicized.""  There were 110 Confucius Institutes and 519 Confucius Classrooms across the US at the end of last year, according to statistics from the Confucius Institute US Center in Washington. Shambaugh suggested that transparency be increased, especially by making Confucius Institute contracts available to campus officials.  Patrick Collins, a Tufts University spokesman, said the university does not anticipate any changes in its relationship with the Confucius Institute, which opened in 2015, as it has made ""valuable learning and cultural contributions to the university"", The Boston Globe reported on March 9.  As to the five schools that have received a letter from Senator Marco Rubio, the universities of North Florida and South Florida, and Miami Dade College have reportedly said they would continue the Confucius Institute operation, saying the program doesn't engage in political or religious activities.  The University of West Florida decided last fall not to renew its Confucius Institute agreement when it expires in May, And Cypress high school, which also was asked by Rubio to cut ties with the Confucius Institute, did not respond to a request for comment.  Hopefully, the assertion of most of the universities that they would continue with the program and Shambaugh's comment are enough to prove the accusations against the Confucius Institutes are baseless.

Congressman's remark should make US accept reality as it is,3/21/2018,"                      Delivering a keynote address at a Brookings Institution forum on ""The End of US Engagement with China?"" on March 7, US Congressman Rick Larsen jestingly said: ""I think you got your title wrong… a more appropriate title would be: '(Is This the) End of US Engagement with China, the EU, Canada, Mexico?' and so on."" On a serious note, he said: ""The short answer to that I think is, no."" Larsen, Democratic representative of Washington's Second District since 2001, is a politician with humor and sees ""a lot of room for cooperation"" with Beijing. And as the co-chair of the bipartisan US-China Working Group, he has a ""realistic"" playbook guiding his attitude and approach toward China. Larsen said he could understand the anxiety of some over China's recent efforts in the South China Sea, its moves for market access and other commitments. But while some of his colleagues in Congress have called for a more hawkish approach toward China, Larsen highlighted ""a more nuanced approach"". He cited the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, in which Kurt Campbell, chairman of the Asia Group, and Ely Ratner, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, note that the US has always set too high a bar in its expectations of shaping China's trajectory. ""Reality warrants clear-eyed thinking of the US approach to China,"" they said. ""Building a stronger and more sustainable approach to, and relationship with Beijing requires honesty about how many fundamental assumptions have turned out wrong."" To explain a more realistic ""side of things"", Larsen used an American football analogy: ""Does the US need to act like a defensive coordinator? Or, do we need to think like a head coach and develop new offensive and defensive strategies, a new playbook, or even dust off the old playbook, that are better tailored to the outcome that we want to see? I certainly… fall on the latter side."" As an example of ""thinking about what offensive tools that we already have and what tools we can develop to play offense"", Larsen said that rather than responding to China's Belt and Road Initiative with alarmism, the US should reinvest in existing programs that promote trade, investment and economic diplomacy. The growth model the US used to talk about-open markets, engagement and trade-is ""pretty good"" but ""we are not doing that in this administration… We are not taking every opportunity we can to remind folks about the growth model for the last 70 years that created the wealth in the world, that created the opportunity in the world that many countries benefited from, including China,"" he said. China has said the current international system is like a well-designed building with multilateralism being its cornerstone. The need is not to build another structure but to renovate the existing one to better reflect the new reality and meet countries' needs. Larsen said: ""And I think, again, we don't need to sometimes create new plays in our playbook, but we have a pretty good playbook already, and we need to enhance what we are doing."" On Capitol Hill, people tend to think of competing with China all the time, when in fact there is a lot of room for cooperation, such as on climate change, counter-terrorism and on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Larsen said. ""We need to think long term about that, and not… stay focused just on the current president's policies and proposals regarding climate change,"" he said. The US' relationship with China is a little like the stock market, going up and down, and ""it can only grow… through continued engagement, through continued dedication and maybe a shot or two of baijiu,"" he said. Baijiu means liquor or spirit in Chinese. Indeed, Larsen's speech sparked spirited discussion that day. Let us hope it will also prompt US politicians to wake up to the reality of the realistic side of things. The author is deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily USA.         "
"Unlike official US stance, more Americans back China's role",3/14/2018,"                          File photo shows the national flags of China and US. [Photo/VCG]   Americans are feeling more positively toward China a year after Donald Trump became the US president, with 53 percent of them saying they have a favorable opinion of China, the highest in nearly three decades, according to the latest Gallup World Affairs survey.  Impressed by the Gallup poll, which was conducted in February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi cited its results at his press briefing on Thursday on the sidelines of the annual session of China's top legislature in Beijing.  ""Cooperation is the main thrust of China-US relations. Our people enjoy close and extensive exchanges,"" Wang said. ""I hope people will pay more attention to such positive things,"" he added.  It seems the favorable rating for China will rise further in the years ahead, because despite the hyping up of the ""China threat"" theory in US media and the branding of Beijing as a ""rival"" by the White House, China's image in the US has not suffered. The number of people seeing China more positively has risen 3 percentage points from last year, according to the 2018 Gallup poll.  Why is there such a gap between the views of the White House and the US public?  ""What is that the (US) mayors and governors want? They want Chinese students, they want Chinese tourists, they want Chinese investment, they want a Chinese company to come and rescue the steel mill that's in town that might otherwise close,"" said Frank Wu, a professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law.  ""So you can simultaneously have incredibly harsh, the most negative rhetoric emanating from Capitol Hill that does not match with the sentiment of the average person on the street, or of politicians who are seeking investment,"" Wu said at a discussion at the Brookings Institute on Wednesday in response to my question.  For long, the rising economic clout of China has been perceived as a threat to the US. There is, however, a silver lining. While according to the Gallup polls in 2013 and 2014, 52 percent of the Americans said the economic power of China posed ""a critical threat"" to the US' vital interests, the percentage has dropped to 40 percent now.  Wang Yi further assured the US citizens that China has no intention of displacing the US in terms of its global role, stressing that any competition between the two sides should be healthy and positive, and they should strive to be partners instead of rivals.  Apart from bilateral trade, closer contacts between the peoples will also help US and Chinese nationals to better understand each other's country. At the first US-China Social and Cultural Dialogue in Washington in September, US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said the country is sending 14,000 American students to China for educational opportunities annually.  This, to some extent, is an expression of friendship toward China by the American people. The same is true of the 350,000 Chinese students studying in the US.  Domestically, Richard Larsen, US Representative for Washington's 2nd congressional district, urged the US to increase the number of students learning Chinese, as ""there are an estimated 300 million English language learners in China"" but ""only 1.6 million Americans identifying themselves as Chinese language speakers in the last census"", he said at the Brookings discussion.  During the Chinese New Year celebrations at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in February, I witnessed firsthand how eager Americans were to better understand China through cultural activities. And an estimated 10,000 people attended the Chinese Family Day on Feb 17 at the Kennedy Center, where children and their parents were fascinated by Chinese folk dance, acrobatics, and shadow puppetry. And many lined up to get a chance to learn the arts of calligraphy, paper umbrella coloring, and red lantern making.  Policymakers of both countries should take advantage of and help maintain the trend of rising favorability toward China, in order to improve overall bilateral ties.

US leaders must introspect before raising rhetoric on trade war,3/7/2018,"                      At a time when US President Donald Trump's plan to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other economies is raising the specter of a trade war, it's important to caution against policymaking based on a ""misjudgment"" or ""wrong perception"". On Thursday, Trump vowed to impose 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, which he claims pose a threat to US national security. Many experts, however, say the United States administration's case looks weak. As trade expert Phil Levy has said, the US Commerce Department report claiming metal imports had eroded the country's ability to make its own weapons also noted the Defense Department's steel needs require a measly 3 percent of total US steel production, which has been a steady 70 percent of the US market's total demand for steel, James Pethokoukis, an American Enterprise Institute economic policy analyst, wrote in a post on Friday. ""So national security is a flimsy, even vaporous, justification for tariffs,"" Pethokoukis said. While Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard US jobs, the impact of the increased prices on steel and aluminum users would destroy more jobs than the import curbs would create. For example, the tariffs will help the steel industry that employs about 140,000 workers but at the cost of far more others, for example, the 6.5 million who work in the industries that buy steel, Reuters and the Associated Press said on Friday. Following Trump's vow to increase tariffs and his ratcheted-up trade war rhetoric, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the first session of the 13th National People's Congress and China's former ambassador to the US and, said on Sunday that China doesn't want a trade war with the US. He cautioned: ""If policies are made on the basis of mistaken judgments or wrong assumptions, it will damage bilateral relations and bring about consequences no side wants to see."" Besides, Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations, said ""the portrayals of China and of US-China relations"" in the US National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and US Trade Representative documents lack context. ""The positive aspects of this relationship were ignored,"" he said, according to a Xinhua report on Saturday. And in January, the White House said the US ""mistakenly"" supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 on terms that have failed to force Beijing to open up its economy. But after China joined the WTO, Americans with lower incomes have been able to save $1,000 to $1,500 a year on the purchase of basic household items alone, the Xinhua report quoted Orlins as saying. ""They can live better. Where is that"" reflected in those trade documents? In his book, Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom is Wrong, Yukon Huang, former World Bank China director, said there have been a slew of prevailing misperceptions about China among Americans. For example, false perceptions about US-China trade has made many Americans reach the wrong decision on which country is the world's leading economic power, says Huang. A decade ago, the annual Gallup and Pew polls on which country is the world's leading economic power would evoke a clear answer from Americans: the United States. Only one in 10 would have said it was China, according to Huang. ""Today, the majority of Americans will say China is the world's leading economic power, while the vast majority of Chinese say America is,"" Huang said at a book discussion. Such misconceptions are driving Americans to believe China is posing a challenge to the US, and it seems US leaders are further perpetrating this belief to derive political benefit out of such misconceptions. That such acts go against the grain of free trade and globalization is obvious. The sooner the prejudiced US leaders and observers change their policies and attitudes the better it will be for the US and the rest of the world.

Visit boosts productive Sino-US ties,2/14/2018,"                      The visit to Washington by State Councilor Yang Jiechi has helped set in motion what a spokesperson for US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says will be a ""constructive and productive"" bilateral relationship during the second year of Trump's presidency. The Feb 8 and 9 visit by Yang happened exactly three months after the historic meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in Beijing. In a few months, US officials will meet their Chinese counterparts in China for the second Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, one of the four dialogue mechanisms agreed to by Xi and Trump at their Mar-a-Lago meeting last April. The first round of the conversation was held in Washington last June. Then in the second half of the year, Chinese and US officials are expected to hold cabinet-level dialogues in areas including the economy, diplomacy, security, social and cultural exchange, law enforcement and cybersecurity. These are important outcomes of Yang's visit to Washington. But more importantly, both sides have reaffirmed to follow through on the consensus and outcomes achieved by the two presidents during their November summit. In their Beijing meeting, Xi and Trump agreed that the two countries have wide-ranging common interests, and promoting bilateral relations is in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the common aspirations of international society. But over the past several months, Washington has unleashed hawkish rhetoric against Beijing and rolled out a raft of protectionist trade measures. It singled out China as a rival in its National Security Strategy, slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and is set to release the results of a probe into what it alleges is intellectual property theft by Chinese businesses, with possible punitive measures ensuing. In turn, Beijing has categorized Washington's worrisome words and moves either symptoms of its persistent Cold War mentality or an abuse of trade remedies that will harm both countries. It has been reported that Yang, who is perceived as one of China's main conduits for talking to the Trump administration, successfully delivered Beijing's message through with two days of face-to-face engagement with Trump and other White House officials. Yang's first port of call was at the State Department, where he spoke with Tillerson, and stressed that the two countries should increase their coordination on key international and regional issues, including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear issue. They also should properly manage and control their differences and sensitive issues to ensure bilateral relations yield more positive outcomes, Yang said. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said Yang and Tillerson ""agreed on the importance of continuing a constructive and productive relationship aimed at cooperation on mutual challenges and addressing our differences forthrightly"". The two also ""discussed the need to achieve a fair and reciprocal bilateral economic relationship and cooperate to stem the flow of deadly narcotics"", Nauert said in a statement on Friday. Yang's visit came a day after the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which aims to encourage high-level visit exchanges between the US and Taiwan. The bill was passed by the US House of Representatives in January. Yang made clear China's stance on Taiwan question, requesting that the US take China's concerns seriously. Tillerson said that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy. While meeting Yang on Friday, Trump asked him to convey his sincere regards to Xi, saying that US-China relations are very important, and that Washington is willing to strengthen cooperation with Beijing to further promote bilateral ties. So, from Taiwan to trade, from increased coordination on the Korean Peninsula issue to high-level dialogues throughout 2018, the road map of China-US relations is clear to both sides. There will be diverse activities and interactions unfolding ahead, but the general trend should be on implementing the consensuses and outcomes reached by the two presidents in their Beijing summit. As a Chinese saying goes, ""The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring."" Let's hope the good start in bilateral relations, kicked off by Yang's exchanges with White House officials a week before the Chinese Spring Festival, will bear bountiful fruit in the second year of Trump's presidency.

Policy review suggests US likely to use nuclear weapons,2/8/2018,"                          Song Chen | China Daily   Compared with the United States' new nuclear doctrine that is noncommittal about scenarios when it might use nuclear weapons, China's policy is unambiguous.  The US Defense Department's Nuclear Posture Review, released on Feb 2, outlines the Pentagon's plans to expand its own nuclear capabilities, while claiming that China's ""lack of transparency regarding the scope and scale of its nuclear modernization program raises questions regarding its future intent"".  Yet to not do something can also be a ""future intent"", and in his comments regarding the US nuclear policy document on Sunday, Ren Guoqiang, spokesman of China's National Defense Ministry, said China ""always abides by the principle of no first use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances"" and will ""unconditionally not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states"".  This diverges remarkably from the Pentagon's posture, which said, ""The United States has never adopted a 'no-first-use' policy and, given the contemporary threat environment, such a policy is not justified today.""  Lisbeth Gronlund, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society, said the Trump administration's Nuclear Posture Review lays out a policy that will make the use of nuclear weapons more likely and undercut US security.  The new policy described in the Nuclear Posture Review broadens the scenarios under which the United States would use nuclear weapons first, thus lowering the threshold for first use, she said on the day the nuclear policy document was released.  The Nuclear Posture Review explicitly lists a wide array of non-nuclear attacks that could constitute grounds for a US nuclear response, she said.  These include, but are not limited to, ""attacks on the US allied or partner civilian populations or infrastructure, and attacks on US or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities"".  In a talk with the National Public Radio aired on Jan 28, Alexandra Bell of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, also said the new policy document has widened the options for the use of nuclear weapons.  ""Nuclear weapons may be used in response to a chemical attack, to a biological weapons attack, to an attack on civilians without a real description of where that threshold is and really widens the options for President Trump to use nuclear weapons,"" Bell, senior policy director of the center, said.  The Pentagon document said it remains the policy of the United States to retain some ambiguity regarding the precise circumstances that might lead to a US nuclear response.  This same rationale, however, could also be employed by other nuclear weapons states, including China, for ambiguity regarding the ""scope and scale"" of their nuclear weapons.  However, there is no ambiguity that there is a huge discrepancy between the size of China's nuclear arsenal and that of the US.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that China has 270 warheads compared to the 6,800 of the US.  At a news briefing at the Pentagon on Feb 2, Anita Friedt, deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance of the US State Department, said, the US had long sought to have dialogue with China to help manage the risk of miscalculations and misperceptions.  Perhaps Washington needs to put aside its Cold War mentality before proceeding to the dialogue, which hopefully will help it to better understand China's intentions, and contribute to easing the apprehensions of the world's most powerful nuclear country about Beijing's nuclear strength.

Unnecessary US fuss about China's rising consumption,1/31/2018,"                          Li Min/China Daily   The media have made quite a fuss about a recent forecast that retail sales in China are expected to equal or exceed those in the United States in 2018. ""China's retail sales are on track to hit just over $5.8 trillion,"" The Washington Post said in a report published on Jan 12, citing data from Mizuho, a Japanese bank.  Forbes, however, said in a post on its website on Jan 26: ""China's 'game changing' retail sales should be greeted with skepticism.""The credibility of Mizuho's data aside is another matter. But of real importance is what China would do when its consumption market overtakes that of the US? Or more bluntly, what would China do when it posts significant deficits in trade?  For the first question, the scenario doesn't seem far away. At the China-Latin America Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum in Santiago, Chile, last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said a recent report by a reputable international agency predicted that in 2018 China will, for the first time, overtake the US in domestic consumption.  Regardless of the accuracy of this forecast, it is expected that the Chinese market, which has three to four times more consumers than the US, will continue the current trend of fast expansion, Wang said, according to a transcript of his speech posted on the Foreign Ministry's website on Jan 27.For such an expanding market, President Xi Jinping has re-affirmed on many occasions that China's door will be only opened wider.  The second question is pertinent in the context of the Donald Trump administration vowing to deal with a ""glaring"" trade deficit with China through a series of trade actions against Beijing.  US President Trump and his trade advisers are considering penalizing China under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 for its alleged ""improper"" intellectual property practice, a move that smells of protectionism. The Trump administration announced last week to slap steep tariffs on Chinese washers and solar cells, an action China's Ministry of Commerce said was an ""abuse"" of trade remedies.  In China, academics and officials have envisaged such US actions, saying the structure of China's trade with the US and other countries will see a fundamental change. ""In the future, many other countries and the US may well sell more to China than they buy from us,"" Wang said in Santiago. ""This may build into a big shift in China's trade structure whereby there will be ever more cases of China running a deficit with its trading partners.""  The world should take note of what Wang said about the veritable scenario when the ""big shift"" occurs. ""When that happens, we will not threaten anyone with something like the Section 301 investigation, nor politicize trade issues… We will continue to follow a positive approach to the workings of new market dynamics and strive to make the pie bigger with greater progress in our business ties with other countries.""  The philosophy behind Wang's remarks is rooted in a Confucius adage, ""do not do to others what you wouldn't have them do to you"". For now, Beijing has said that ""trade protectionism is a double-edged sword"" that hurts the user as it pierces others.  John Edwards, a nonresident fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia, has stated that the reality of the trading relations between China and the US is ""distinctly different"" from the 2017 Report to Congress on China's WTO Compliance submitted early this month by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which suggests the bilateral trade relationship is woefully bad, and much worse than it was.  ""In the decade from 2006 to 2016, the last year for which we have full-year data, US goods exports to China increased at nearly twice the rate of China exports to the US: 116 percent compared to 61 percent, using US Census Bureau numbers,"" Edwards, an adjunct professor with the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy at Curtin University, wrote on Jan 24. That explains a lot of things.  The author is deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily USA.huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com         "
US should see the huge potential ahead instead of condemning China,1/24/2018,"                          Jiao Haiyang / China Daily   In November, the United States administration refused to recognize China's market economy status, going back on the promise it had made when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. And last week's US statement suggested it regrets supporting China's entry into the WTO.  The moves didn't come as a surprise to policy observers familiar with the US National Security Strategy report released a month ago, which said the US needs to rethink its policies of the past two decades. The report also said competitions require the US to rethink ""policies based on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners. For the most part, this premise turned out to be false.""  It's not difficult to assume from the US logic that the two largest economies are likely heading toward heightened friction. But is this rationale really rational?  In an article, ""Was pre-Trump US policy towards China based on 'false' premises?"", published three days after the security strategy report was issued, Jeffrey A. Bader and Ryan Hass, senior fellows at the Brookings Institutions in Washington, said China's WTO membership helped it to become the world's second-largest importing country. Commenting on the strategy report's claim that the premise of US policy-that China's inclusion in institutions and global commerce would make it benign and trustworthy-has been mostly false, the two scholars said: ""This description is a mixture of truisms, appropriate exhortations, dubious analysis, and bad history.""  ""Logically, that would seem to suggest that China should be expelled from international institutions and its role in global commerce should be marginalized,"" they said. ""Is that the (Donald) Trump administration's goal? Needless to say, neither objective will be achieved, in whole or in part.""  The accomplishments of such engagement, they said, contradict the strategy's assessment. For one thing, one should not overlook the fact that China's economy ""has expanded profits for leading US companies… and its government helped prevent a worldwide depression in 2008-09 through its large stimulus package, which was developed in cooperation with (US) Treasury Secretaries (Henry) Paulson and (Timothy) Geithner,"" they said.  During a dinner organized by the China General Chamber of Commerce in New York on Jan 17, Tung Chee-hwa, honorary chair of the chamber, said he was disheartened to learn that ""some Americans feel betrayed"". Tung, also head of the China-United States Exchange Foundation, said: ""They feel that, after four decades of generally positive and supportive relations between the two countries, including US support for China to enter the WTO, China has not become like America, as they expected."" But China never said it would adopt a US-style political system, Tung said.  Tung, a former chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, fell short of saying China is a ""benign actor"" on the world stage, but stated the country is a ""responsible global actor"".  ""No country has done more domestically in recent years to take measures to mitigate the effects of climate change. No country has contributed more troops to UN peacekeeping efforts in recent years. Also, China's economic activity has contributed between 30-50 percent of global economic growth in the last few years,"" he said.  Also speaking at the New York event, Cui Tiankai, China's top envoy to the US, said: ""It's hard to convince the international community that the largest and most advanced economy in the world has been the main victim of economic globalization… Nothing is sillier than questioning one's own success. Nothing is more harmful than denying the huge potential and great prospects of building a strong and mutually beneficial relationship between China and the US.""  Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do, wrote Dale Carnegie in his 1936 best-seller How to Win Friends and Influence People. Wise people always refrain from indulging in a blame game and, instead, see the huge potential and great prospects ahead.

Time to forget nuclear buttons at desks,1/5/2018,"                      Following almost a year of a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang, US President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea's leader Kim Jong-un are threatening each other with the nuclear buttons at their desks at the onset of the new year, which doesn't seem to augur well for 2018.  On his Twitter account on Tuesday, Trump said that his nuclear button is ""much bigger and more powerful"" than Kim's, hours after Kim said in his New Year's Day speech that, ""The entire mainland of the US is within the range of our nuclear weapons and the nuclear button is always on the desk of my office.""  For those looking forward to a glimpse of peace at the end of the long tunnel of conflicts and threats, such rhetoric is shocking. It means the situation on the Korean Peninsula risks degrading further into a vicious cycle of provocation and confrontation.  The situation took a new twist earlier on Wednesday, when Pyongyang reopened a long-closed communications channel with Seoul in Panmunjom, the truce village. The two sides will use the channel to hold working-level discussions regarding the DPRK's delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in the Republic of Korea.  Such efforts to improve bilateral ties and ease tensions should be applauded. In addition to that, Washington and Pyongyang should forget nuclear buttons at desks and come to the table for talks.  After all, the US and the DPRK are the two parties directly concerned in the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, and the contradiction between them is at the crux of the crisis.  The nuclear button mentioned by the heads of the two countries reminded many people of a talk by US State Secretary Rex Tillerson on Dec 12, in which he said, ""I will continue our diplomatic efforts until the first bomb drops.""  Tillerson said the US had also prepared otherwise: ""I'm going to be confident that we're going to be successful, but I'm also confident Secretary (of Defense James) Mattis will be successful if it ends up being his turn.""  So far, the Trump administration's policy on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue remains one that ""all options are on the table"", as stressed by US Vice-President Mike Pence again in a talk on Wednesday.  Pence said that if Pyongyang will abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions, ""if they will dismantle those programs, there's an opportunity for a peaceable solution"", according to a White House transcript of his talks with the Voice of America.  The Korean Peninsula nuclear issue has lasted for more than two decades. As pointed out by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in late November, the most valuable experience in the process is that if all parties meet each other halfway to create a positive interaction, agreements then follow.  The most important lesson is that if some parties flex their muscles and misunderstand each other, the opportunities for peace will disappear, Wang said.  The New York-based Council on Foreign Relations has reasonably identified armed confrontation between the US and the DPRK as the top conflict to watch in 2018 in its annual Preventive Priorities Survey released early last month.  To prevent the specter that the world would least expect, it's important for all sides to exercise restraint and speak and act in a way that will help ease tension.  Instead of touting who has the more powerful button, let's talk about who has the more powerful brain for reasonable solutions. It is already a hot-button issue.

China is running a winning race against its poverty,1/3/2018,"                      As China rings in the New Year, it is racing against the clock to fulfill a promise that its leadership has proclaimed to the world: getting at least 10 million impoverished rural residents out of their situation, which translates to nearly 1 million people per month, or 20 every minute. There were 43.35 million Chinese living below the national poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($354) in annual income at the end of 2016. The country has pledged to eliminate poverty by 2020, so that would mean ending poverty for about 10 million people a year. There are plenty of numbers and while some can be mind-numbing, they can also be heart-warming in the news they convey. Take a line from a poem evoked by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday in his New Year Address. ""How I wish I could have 10,000 houses to provide shelter for all who need it,"" the president said, quoting Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and adding that in 2017, 3.4 million people were relocated from poverty-stricken areas and now live in warm new housing. In the speech, the president reiterated that lifting all of China's rural impoverished population out of poverty by current standards is a solemn commitment that will be honored. ""After three years, we will win the final phase of the war on poverty. This will be the first time in thousands of years of Chinese history that extreme poverty has been eliminated,"" Xi said. Poverty reduction was also a theme of Xi's speech at the landmark 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on Oct 18, and one of the top tasks assigned for the coming three years at a central economic work conference last month. In China, the government's role in poverty relief is most evident in mapping out national poverty reduction programs. Following the country's first such plan in 1994, which aimed to get 80 million rural residents out of poverty in seven years through 2000, China has initiated two consecutive national poverty relief programs, each lasting for a decade, for the years from 2001 through 2020. In December 2016, it further released a special five-year plan to ramp up poverty alleviation efforts. It's safe to say that one of the most inspiring lessons in China's poverty relief is its practice of setting timetables and mobilizing resources to live up to the strategies. The plans ensure the policies and priorities are geared to what should be accomplished in each specific phase, and appropriate funds are allocated for the tough job, without being diverted elsewhere. The past four years alone have seen China pool 196.1 billion yuan for poverty relief, with an annual growth of 19 percent. In the past five years, more than 60 million people were helped out of poverty, thus reducing the country's poverty rate from 10.2 percent to less than 4 percent, according to official statistics. A targeted inspection on the use and management of poverty relief funds in 28 regions from March to May 2017 retrieved 730 million yuan of misused poverty-reduction funds, and nearly 450 people have been investigated and punished for fraudulent claims or misappropriation of funds, Xinhua reported on Saturday, citing sources from the Ministry of Finance and the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development. While the elimination of poverty has long been regarded as a major task for humanity, until now it has been deemed a utopian dream, said Bill Jones, Washington bureau chief of Economic Intelligence Review. Globally, more than 800 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day, many lacking access to adequate food, clean drinking water or adequate sanitation, according to the United Nations Development Programme. ""With China that dream is now becoming a reality, and has created a tremendous amount of optimism that it can also be eliminated globally,"" Jones told China Daily. Interestingly, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that a majority in the US say the government should have a ""major role"" in such issues as helping lift people out of poverty. Currently, 67 percent say the government should have a major role in addressing poverty, up from 55 percent two years ago, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center on Dec 14.

Innovation can be good area for Sino-US cooperation,12/28/2017,"                      Is there any similarity between the speech delivered by President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Oct 18, and the National Security Strategy launched by US President Donald Trump on Dec 18?  The two are anything but symmetrical. Xi's speech was the keynote address to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which charted the course for the country's future development, while the US Congress-mandated document outlines the Trump administration's appraisal of the US' security interests and the ways to safeguard them.  Yet the two documents have a striking common factor: the emphasis on innovation. And innovation is an area the two countries have much to cooperate on.  Trump's first National Security Strategy mentions innovation at least 30 times, more than double the number in the strategy his predecessor Barack Obama announced in 2015. And innovation finds more than 50 mentions in Xi's landmark speech.  While Xi emphasized that innovation is the primary driving force for development and the strategic underpinning for building a modern economy, Trump stressed that innovation has been key to the US' greatness and indispensable to American prosperity and power.  Both presidents have vowed to maintain and maximize their respective country's innovation and technological edge, by making advancements in science and technology, and nurturing and retaining inventors and innovators. Specifically, Trump and Xi have pledged to prioritize innovation in aerospace and emerging technologies that are critical to economic growth and national security.  In addition, Trump's call to spur innovation in new materials, new energy, artificial intelligence and biomedicine is identical to those specified in the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual national legislative session early this year.  Although they might have accorded similar importance to innovation, the difference in the two countries' ingenuity levels is huge-at least in terms of research and development expenditure and human resources. The US is by far the world's biggest spender: It spent as much as 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product on R&D in 2015, while China spent 2.1 percent, according to the 2015 UIS Innovation Data Collection, the latest survey released by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics in April. And the US has a much bigger GDP than China.  In terms of human resources, the US had 4,232 researchers per 1 million people in 2014, while China had only 1,113, according to the UNESCO report. Given its increasing economic clout, China is expected to catch up with the US in R&D expenditure in the near future, as it had an astonishing average annual growth rate of 18.3 percent in R&D spending, the UNESCO report said. But in human resource R&D, China has a long way to go to catch up with the US, which boasts the world's best strategy in recruiting and retaining talent, as well as cultivating world-class scientists and technologists.  That is the key to addressing a glaring deficiency in China, where about 72 percent of innovation-oriented companies said the lack of qualified personnel was a big barrier to innovation, according to the UNESCO report.  That the Chinese and US presidents give the same level of importance to innovation means it could be an important area of cooperation between the two countries, which have already committed to advancing the renewal of the historic 1970s Science & Technology Agreement while strengthening joint scientific research, and finding ways for province-state cooperation on technological innovation, according to an action plan issued after the first US-China Social and Cultural Dialogue in late September.  The dialogue is one of the four Cabinet-level dialogues agreed by the two presidents at their Mar-a-Lago meeting in April. Under the action plan, Beijing and Washington will also encourage their businesses to cooperate in areas of innovation and entrepreneurship, and their technology-driven think tanks to exchange ideas and plans.

"One step forward, one step back for global carbon emission cuts",12/21/2017,"                      The divergence of policies and priorities of the world's two largest economies in combating climate change stood in stark contrast on Monday. In Beijing, where improving air quality has become a major policy priority, China's top economic planner unveiled plans for a national carbon market-likely the world's largest-where enterprises can trade their emissions credits. It is another bold step the country is taking to deliver on its Paris Agreement promises.  In contrast, Washington policy observers were quick to point out that the new US National Security Strategy released by the White House on Monday had removed climate change from the list of worldwide threats menacing the United States. It was a significant departure from the Barack Obama administration, which described climate change as an ""urgent and growing threat"" to US national security.  The initial phase of China's carbon trading program is expected to cover 1,700 power plants, which emit 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon annually, or about one-third of the nation's total emissions, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.  Additional sectors such as cement and aluminum will be phased in over the coming years, the Environmental Defense Fund said in a release on Tuesday.  ""The world has never before seen a climate program on this scale,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the New York-based organization, which provided technical assistance to China's carbon trading pilot programs. ""It's important that the world's largest emitter should lead on climate, and that is precisely what China is doing by launching its national emissions trading system.""  In its latest Global Energy Outlook released earlier this month, the International Energy Agency predicted China's coal use, which peaked in 2013, is set to decline by almost 15 percent by 2040.  China's policy choices will play a huge role in determining global trends and could spark a faster clean-energy transition, the IEA noted.  In a speech at the landmark 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, General Secretary Xi Jinping vowed to promote green development and ramp up the campaign to prevent and control air pollution.  The country is also transitioning toward a more services-based economy, which the IEA said ""is moving the energy sector in a new direction"".  The IEA's outlook says stringent fuel-efficiency measures for cars and trucks, and a push for 1 in 4 cars being electric by 2040, means that China is no longer the main driving force behind global oil use.  It further projected China's carbon emissions to plateau at 9.2 gigatonnes, only slightly above the current level, by 2030, which means it'll meet the promise it made when signing the Paris climate pact in 2015.  It is noticeable that on Monday the IEA published its Coal 2017 report, cautioning that coal use will see a decade-long period of stagnation, with the share of the fossil fuel in the global energy mix forecast to decline to 26 percent in 2022.  Back in Washington, the omission of climate change as a national security threat in President Donald Trump's first National Security Strategy is a logical follow-up to the climate change skeptical administration's effort to roll back the rules and regulations of the Obama administration, which were designed to reduce carbon emissions, including those from coal-fired power plants.  And that is a source for concern, as US Senator Michael F. Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, pointed out on Twitter: ""One topic noticeably missing from #NationalSecurity-Strategy: Climate change. Bipartisan group of lawmakers have acknowledged#climatechange as a national security threat. @POTUS silence is cause for serious concern.""

"With concerted efforts, world can still resolve DPRK issue peacefully",12/14/2017,"                          Berit Reiss-Andersen (L), chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, hands over the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize to Beatrice Fihn (R), leader of ICAN, and Hirsoshima nuclear bombing survivor Setsuko Thurlow (C) during the award ceremony of the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize at the city hall in Oslo, Norway, Dec 10, 2017. [Photo/VCG]   The annual Preventive Priorities Survey of New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, released on Monday, has listed a possible armed confrontation between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as the ""top conflict"" to watch in 2018.  In Northeast China's Jilin province that borders the DPRK, the Jilin Daily published a full page of ""common sense"" advice on Dec 6, counseling readers how to protect themselves from a nuclear explosion, which local authorities later said was routine publicizing of national defense knowledge.  In Oslo, Norway, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, while receiving the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony on Sunday, warned that humankind's destruction is just one ""impulsive tantrum away"".The three events that took place thousands of kilometers apart in less than a week are not the type of happenings that one might use to usher in the New Year.  In the Preventive Priorities Survey, foreign policy experts ranked a military conflict involving the US, the DPRK, and its neighboring countries as No 1 on the top-tier risks. Its impact on US interests was identified as high, meaning it is a contingency directly threatening the US homeland.  The likelihood of the risk is moderate, which means it has ""about an even chance of occurring in 2018"", according to the survey. Given the warlike threats exchanged between Washington and Pyongyang, the top risk could unfortunately become a reality unless something substantial is done.  Since Dec 4, Seoul and Washington have been engaged in a five-day air force exercise (their largest ever) after Pyongyang tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov 29, which it claimed was capable of striking the US mainland. The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency said the drill pushed the already acute situation to ""the brink of nuclear war"".  The air force drill was followed by a two-day joint maritime exercise by the US, the Republic of Korea and Japan on Monday to track ballistic missiles, possibly from the DPRK, in the waters near the Korean Peninsula and Japan.  The KCNA, in an editorial on Monday, accused Washington of ""spitting out"" military threats against the DPRK and pressuring other countries to cut off their diplomatic, economic and trade ties with Pyongyang. It is apparent that the peninsula is caught in a vicious circle of provocation and confrontation.On Dec 9, United Nations Under secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, the first such senior UN envoy to visit Pyongyang since 2010, highlighted the ""urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict"", emphasizing that the international community, alarmed by the escalating tensions, is committed to finding a peaceful solution.  This conforms to Beijing's proposal for de-escalation, to at least bring the peninsula situation out of the ""black hole"" of confrontation, and endeavor to create the right conditions and atmosphere for the resumption of dialogue and negotiation. It also calls for a halt to muscle flexing and stirring up new troubles, and gradually accumulating trust.  It is thus encouraging to note that the DPRK agreed with the UN ""to regularize communication through visits at various levels"", according to an AFP report. The international community will ultimately realize that China's proposal for a political solution based on a dual-suspension proposal and a dual-track approach, is the only way to ease the tensions on the peninsula.  Dualsuspension means the DPRK suspending its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and the ROK suspending their large-scale military drills, and the dual-track approach means making efforts to simultaneously move forward the process of denuclearization and establishing a peaceful mechanism on the peninsula.  The hope of peace remains alive. The worst-case scenario, which the US Council on Foreign Relations asked policymakers to guard against, has a full year's time in which concerted efforts can be made to prevent it.

"Every reason for China, US to work together",11/30/2017,"                      China-watchers in Washington have lamented the lack of a presidential speech on China for some time. So the Brookings Institution invited seven scholars last week and asked them to put themselves in the shoes of US National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and prepare such a speech. The discussions led by Brookings Vice-President Bruce Jones on ""Avoiding war: Containment, competition and cooperation in US-China relations"" are indeed interesting - some insightful, others just implausible. While most of the scholars underscored the need to cooperate with China and clearly define what Washington's interests are in its relationship with Beijing, Robert Kagan, a senior fellow with the Project on International Order and Strategy at Brookings, saw ""conflicting interests"". ""My attitude toward China is do well economically, but you cannot use your military to expand your power position in the region,"" Kagan said. ""Is that fair? No. Is there any justice to that? No,"" he said, as if in a monologue. ""We get the Monroe Doctrine and you don't. That's just the way it is. I'm sorry."" Kagan's overbearing ""the way it is"" approach is outrageous. Kagan seems to believe that where there is strength, hegemony ensues. That's why he proposed ramping up US military capacity. While the US may lack a clearcut policy on China, President Xi Jinping has made his view on hegemony clear in his speeches in New York, Geneva and Beijing. China will never waver in its pursuit of peaceful development, Xi said in Geneva in January, three days before Trump was sworn in as US president. ""No matter how strong its economy grows, China will never seek hegemony, expansion or sphere of influence,"" Xi said at the United Nations Office in Geneva, re-emphasizing what he had said at the UN Headquarters in New York on Sept 28, 2015. He further highlighted this point in his speech at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last month. At the Washington gathering, Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings, said Xi has emphasized there are a thousand reasons for the US and China to work together - and no reason for the two sides to fight. ""I think our president (Trump) should probably take a similar view,"" Li said. Mira Rapp-Hooper, a senior fellow at Yale's Paul Tsai China Center, said Washington's ""real competition"" with Beijing exists in security issues in Asia, where the interests of the US are not ""quite clearly defined"". Besides, the US is yet to devise a policy response to China's Belt and Road Initiative. ""And it's not clear to me that that's a zero-sum game,"" she said. ""There may well be places where our interests are complementary."" David Dollar, another senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center, said ""competition with cooperation"" is a good framework. ""I see cooperation largely in terms of efforts to reform global institutions like the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the multilateral development banks, and that's where cooperating around the Belt and Road Initiative comes in."" Jonathan Stromseth, who holds the Lee Kuan Yew Chair in Southeast Asian Studies at Brookings' Center for East Asia Policy Studies, said some US companies are already trying to win Belt and Road contracts. They could also look at what's emerging in regional infrastructure and try to calibrate their business plans accordingly, he said. The other points the Chinawatchers raised included those of Ryan Hass, a David M. Rubenstein fellow at Brookings, who stressed the need to ""find a way to live with an ascendant China that is aggressive in some areas, and work to create a durable, constructive relationship with them"". It is unclear if or how McMaster would benefit from the experts' opinions. But in an interview with CGTN earlier this month, McMaster said: "" ... the comprehensive policy toward China would be to identify... areas where we can... cooperate effectively on... mutual interest and concern.""

Still hope US will join hands to combat climate change,11/9/2017,"                      With a new round of UN Climate Change Conference being held in Bonn, Germany, from Monday to Nov 17, and with US President Donald Trump visiting China from Wednesday through Friday, many people feel nostalgic about those days when Beijing and Washington took the lead in pushing for and formally signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, showing a good example of big powers joining hands to meet global challenges.  So it is encouraging to hear the rising voices calling for China and the United States to ramp up cooperation on climate change despite Trump's decision in June to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and focus instead on bolstering the US' fossil fuel industry.  In Bonn, government delegates and experts are working on a ""rule book"" for the Paris Agreement, which seeks to end the fossil fuel era in the second half of the century by shifting the world economy to such cleaner energy as wind and solar power, according to a Reuters report.  A week before the crucial Bonn conference, China's chief climate change negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, expressed hope that Washington would stay in the Paris accord and contribute to the global agenda on fighting climate change. China has made it clear that it's willing to deepen collaboration with the US in areas such as clean energy, energy and resource conservation, and carbon capture and storage, said Xie, who is attending the Bonn meeting.  David Dollar, senior fellow at John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, told me in an interview that the ballast in Sino-US relations is their cooperation on the global public goods, the most important of which are free trade and climate change. Without successful cooperation on issues that matter to the global public, bilateral ties will likely become more volatile and bounce back and forth on trivialities, Dollar said.  And last week, Cui Tiankai, Beijing's top envoy in Washington, said that many international community members have pinned hopes on the US and China playing their due parts in addressing global challenges.  It is interesting to note that on Nov 3, the day when Trump left for his 12-day trip to Asia, a major US government report affirmed that global warming is real and is ""extremely likely"" caused by human activities, a stark contrast with Trump's position on climate change. Also noteworthy is the passion of US businesses and many states in pursuing green development and expanding cooperation with China, which will lead to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  Of the 29 company CEOs accompanying Trump on his visit to China, 10 are engaged in liquefied natural gas or other energy fields, raising the prospect of deals on liquefied natural gas, which causes less pollution than coal, according to a Xinhua report.  Jerry Brown, governor of California, which is the largest economy among US states, champions sub-national cooperation in climate change. He visited China in early June to sign agreements with the Ministry of Science and Technology and two provincial governments to work together on reducing emissions.  Last Tuesday, UN Environment Programme Executive Director Erik Solheim said: ""In all likelihood, the United States of America will live up to its Paris commitment, not because of the White House, but because of the private sector… All the big American companies are dedicated to go in the green direction.""  That coincides with the trend in China, where green development was highlighted at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which drew up a blueprint for the country's economic growth in the next five years. The matched trends hopefully mean a broad prospect of climate change cooperation between China, the US and the rest of the world.

False notion led to wrong impression about China,11/2/2017,"                              A ship loads containers at a terminal in Qingdao, Shandong province. [Photo/China Daily]      It's a book that takes on conventional thinking-if not biases-held by many Americans about China, and very simply knocks it down. And it could come at no better time since US President Donald Trump will start his first state visit to China in a few days and misperceptions about China seem to be as rife in the White House as they are in average American households.  Former World Bank China director Yukon Huang talked about his latest book, Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong, last week to an audience at World Bank headquarters in Washington.  Huang, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said at a book talk on Oct 27 that Trump and his advisers had said that too much of US foreign direct investment is going to China, resulting in job losses and declining competitiveness.  According to the White House, ""we left jobs overseas, we left jobs to China; we need to bring them back here"", but, in fact, only 1.5 percent of US foreign investment goes to China, Huang said, backing up his claim with a slew of diagrams.  ""In my book, I explain this by the composition of trade and say if we get the diagnosis wrong, we get the policy recommendations wrong,"" he said. ""It is about how to get more of America's foreign investment to China, rather than worrying that too much is going to China.""  Speaking at a panel discussion on ""China's 19th Party Congress Outcomes and Analysis"" sponsored by the US-China Policy Foundation on Oct 26, Huang said that many average Americans share Trump's sentiment that China is responsible for the US trade deficits.  Those deficits were significant in the 1990s and had surged by 2006 and then they started to moderate. China's trade surpluses were essentially nonexistent until 2004 or 2005, then they started to get very big and then they came down, Huang said.  ""America's trade balances and China's trade balances move totally in the wrong direction,"" he said.  In his book, Huang argued that trade balances are the result of multilateral rather than bilateral relationships.  ""How could China be responsible for America's trade problems, when in fact, America's trade problems existed long before China even became an export power and their balances moved in opposite directions?"" he writes in his book.  False perceptions about trade have created a wrong impression in the United States about who is the world's leading economic power, according to Huang.  A decade ago, annual surveys of Americans by Gallup and Pew about who is the world's leading economic power would generate a clear answer: America by far was the leading economic power; only 10 percent said it was China, Huang said at the discussion.  Today, the majority of Americans will say China is the world's leading economic power, while the vast majority of Chinese say America is, Huang said.  But the vast majority of China analysts argue that internal rebalancing is needed, and this view has featured prominently in China's policy discussions with the US.  For despite its impressive performance, China's growth process has been internally unbalanced, defined by its exceptionally low share of consumption to GDP and comparatively high share of investment to GDP.  Huang said cracking the conundrum of China is not whether one should be positive or negative about China's economy and its implications for the US, but instead about fitting China into a framework that leads to a better understanding of the reality.

Trump should be shown the complexity of China's reality,10/19/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump speaks next to first lady Melania Trump after meeting with police at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 4, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    The itinerary for US President Donald Trump's visit to China next month may already be ironed out, but David Lampton, a senior China expert in the United States, would like it to go beyond focusing on policy issues between the two countries.    For the president and any other political leader in the US or other countries who do not have much knowledge of China, it is important to get to know the whole picture of the country, said Lampton, who has traveled numerous times to China since the 1970s and is director of China Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.  ""This should be an opportunity to expose him to the complexity and diversity of China,"" he said.  The White House, in a statement released on Monday, said Trump will arrive in Beijing on Nov 8""for a series of bilateral, commercial, and cultural events"", including meetings with President Xi Jinping.  It did not say if Trump, a former New York businessman, will be travelling outside Beijing to get to know more about China and its people, or if he would, like his predecessor Barack Obama did in 2009, have a town hall meeting at a campus.  Early last month, the US Department of State said the US first lady, Melania Trump, will travel with Trump.  ""I know Chinese like to invite people and show them good things, modern things, all this kind of things,"" said Lampton.  He said this is all to the good, but they should show him the diversity of China, ""show what it is to govern China, how big it is-most provinces in China are bigger than European countries-how heterogeneous it is,"" he said.  Lampton, who has written several books on China, said visitors to the country are fully acquainted with the modern China, like Pudong in coastal Shanghai. But China is a very diverse country, and it still has a lot of people that are at a modest level of economic development, the former president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations said.  ""I'm a teacher, and I believe to know more is a good thing,"" Lampton said. ""The more you know when you make a decision, the better off you are.""  If US leaders make policy assuming all of China is like Pudong then of course they're going to treat the country as a very powerful country with no problems, he said.  US leaders need to understand that, like themselves, Chinese leaders have a lot of things on their minds, Lampton said. The country has its own problems to solve, and ""Chinese leaders aren't spending all their time thinking about how to make life more difficult for Americans"".  ""They're trying to think how to improve life for Chinese people"" he said. ""So I would say a very important objective of the visit should be to give Trump a balanced understanding of what China is, not only what China is today, but what China wants to become,"" Lampton said.  From 1972 when the two countries established formal diplomatic relations to 2009, US presidents from Richard Nixon to Obama have visited cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Guilin (in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, South China) and Hong Kong.  Xi had the first face-to-face informal summit with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April.

Are bomb shelters the only option to escape a nuclear war?,8/31/2017,"                      US President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday that ""all options"" are again on the table after Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile, this time a rare firing of a projectile over Japan.  The new missile test has triggered consternation on the ground, causing sirens to blare in Japanese towns, stocks to dip on Wall Street, and diplomats from Seoul and Beijing to Moscow to call for either further sanctions or more restraints.  But what can the average citizen do under the apocalyptic threat of a missile or nuclear war? Among a myriad of answers, the headline of a news story caught my attention: ""Bomb shelter business booms as Trump and North Korea posture"".  The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula has raised the specter of a nuclear attack, which has given rise to the bomb shelter business in the US and elsewhere, according to a report from McClatchy new agency in Washington.  Ron Hubbard, president of Atlas Survival Shelters in Montebello, California, which produces what it touts as the ""only bunkers tested against the effects of a nuclear bomb"", said he expects to sell at least""1,000 big bomb shelters and tornado shelters combined"" this year compared with 10 bomb shelters in 2011.  ""The rise in shelters (sales and inquires) has increased in both America and Japan"", Hubbard said on Tuesday, adding that there were no customers in China but a few inquiries from the Republic of Korea.  Another company, Rising S Bunkers in Murchison, Texas, has sold 67 bomb shelters this year, mostly to Japan, compared with just nine in 2016, according to the McClatchy report on Sunday.  Hubbard may be right to claim that ""shelters are the only solution to the crisis and there is nothing else a person can do except taking shelter if a bomb comes in"". But the question is not only how many people can afford the luxury, or how many such bunkers would be enough.  The root cause of the current war rhetoric of the leaderships, the panic among the masses, and the impulse for some to own a shelter, is that we have seen a cycle of endless nuclear tests, missile launches and military drills.  Each party has its own legitimate security concerns. Pyongyang vows to never give up its weapons programs, or take ""tough counter-measures"" against hostility from the United States and its allies, particularly the ongoing annual US-ROK military drills.  On Tuesday, US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that ""enough is enough"", while Russia's ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said: ""It's troubling, because tensions are high and whose nerves are stronger, we don't know.""  Beijing has proposed ""dual suspension""-Pyongyang suspends its nuclear and missile activities and the US and the ROK suspend their big military drills. The proposal accommodates the legitimate security concerns of all parties, serves to draw them back to the negotiating table and seek a balanced resolution, while ensuring long-term peace and stability on the peninsula.  The Chinese initiative should, therefore, be taken seriously by all parties.  Hours after Pyongyang test-fired the latest missile test, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a regular news briefing: ""I suggest you think about the scenario when China calls for restraint, calmness and dialogue, while directly concerned parties keep conducting military exercises and ratcheting up military pressure, against the background of flying missiles launched by another party.""  ""Then, who should take the blame and who should do more?"" Hua asked.  The US is now grappling with and recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which killed at least 11 people and paralyzed Houston. The fourth most-populous US city has opened more megashelters to house flooded families.  Let's forget the bomb shelters for now, and go all out to prevent man-made disasters.

Washington's smear campaign against Huawei doomed to fail,3/1/2019,"                      Company logo at the office of Huawei in Beijing, Dec 6, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   US President Donald Trump said last week that he wants the United States to become a technology leader through open and fair competition rather than by blocking others of their ""currently more advanced technologies."" The message came as a surprise because US officials have been busy waging an aggressive smear campaign against Huawei, Chinese telecommunications equipment maker and the world's leading 5G technology player.  In the week leading to Trump's speech, US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went from Warsaw to Munich to Brussels to pressure Europeans to ban Huawei from their 5G networks or face US ""punishment"".  Many expected Trump's words to put an end to the smear campaign, but they have proven ineffective. Major European countries have come out one after another, saying they will make their own decisions, and some have already refused to impose a total ban on Huawei as ordered by Washington.  However, the US State Department has ignored Trump's remark that Washington does not seek to artificially block any companies in 5G. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona which opened on Monday, US State Department ambassador for cyber and international communications Robert Strayer continued to portray Huawei as a national security threat, without providing any evidence.  The logic for Strayer and other US officials seems to be that Huawei is guilty until proven innocent, a violation of the legal principle that has been held dear by the international community, including under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That is why Vodafone CEO Nick Read, who operates the biggest mobile carrier in the Western world, questioned the unsubstantiated allegation by the US. Read not only warned that removing Huawei equipment would be ""hugely disruptive"" to 5G rollouts, but also said that he prefers to make sure ""we have a fact-based conversation"".  Read was not alone. I sought the views on Tuesday of Clemens Fuest, a prominent German economist, who also challenged the logic of assuming that a company poses a security threat simply because it is based in China.  While the US has been making all kinds of speculative allegations against Chinese telecom companies, Huawei's rotating chairman Guo Ping shed light on Wednesday by calling out the US as the true threat to cybersecurity.  In an article in the Financial Times, Guo said that if the US National Security Agency wants to modify routers or switches in order to eavesdrop, a Chinese company will be unlikely to cooperate. He cited a leaked NSA document which said NSA wanted ""to make sure that we know how to exploit these (Huawei) products"". Guo argued that Huawei ""hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants,"" emphasizing that ""Huawei has not (planted) and will never plant backdoors"".  In a 2014 article, the German news magazine Spiegel, too, had revealed that the NSA made considerable efforts to spy on Chinese politicians and companies, with Huawei being a major target.  The current episode reminds people of five years ago when the US, then led by president Barack Obama, lobbied its European allies to not join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, by questioning the AIIB's governance and environmental standards. However, major US allies from Europe to Asia, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and the Republic of Korea, all defied the US and became the founding members of the AIIB.  That seems to be increasingly the case as more countries from Europe to Asia to Africa to Latin America defy the US and embrace Huawei's 5G technology, a technology that is a product of global cooperation.

Merkel's slap down of US stance reveals allies' growing rift,2/22/2019,"                          US President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a meeting during the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Dec 1, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   US leaders are used to lecturing the world, including their European allies. But when Vice-President Mike Pence tried to do that at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, he was taught a hard lesson that he might not forget for the rest of his life.  After criticizing European leaders for sticking to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and for trying to bypass the US sanctions on Iran, Pence arrogantly demanded in Munich that the European Union and its key members, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, quit the deal.  He also pressed European nations to ban Huawei in their 5G network development and to stop buying arms and energy from Russia. ""We cannot ensure the defense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East,"" Pence said.  However, his ""America First"" talk was met with a cold shoulder from the audience, as reflected in their silence when Pence was expecting applause. The deafening silence spoke volumes about Europeans' disapproval of many of the policies and practices of the current United States administration despite the many headaches within the EU, from Brexit to rising populism.  I am not sure if Pence listened to the speech by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in which she delivered a sharp critique of US foreign policy.  Her passionate call for win-win cooperation and multilateralism contrasted sharply with Pence's dark worldview, full of hateful, confrontational and Cold War bluster.  Merkel said that Europe had learned a lesson from World War II and Nazi history, and that even though international multilateral forums may be slow or arduous, she was convinced that the US should put itself in the other person's shoes, and try to forge win-win situations rather than trying to solve issues on its own.  To Merkel, the US is pulling the world, especially Europe, back to the Cold War by pulling out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a treaty signed in 1987 between the US and the Soviet Union and regarded as a major step toward ending the Cold War.  Merkel did not hide her outrage when she warned that ""for us Europeans the really bad news of this year is the cancellation of the INF Treaty"" and ""the answer can't lie in a blind race to build more weapons"", a reference to Washington's threat ""to develop our own military response options"" and ""to deny Russia any military advantage.""  Merkel's words were greeted with a standing ovation from the audience. Many of them were happy to see that a European leader was finally standing up to Washington instead of remaining silent and following it blindly.  It was not a good week for Pence, who traveled to Europe and met his Waterloo while trying to force Europe to take orders from Washington. It was also a debacle for his tireless efforts to defame Huawei and coerce European nations which plan to use Huawei in their 5G networks.  Just two days after his speech, the Financial Times reported that the UK Cyber Security Center concluded that any alleged risk from using Huawei's equipment is manageable.  At the same time, it was a week of waking up for Europe, and many nations around the world, with the realization that they should make their own decisions, instead of being dictated to by Washington as they have been for decades.

Pew Center survey results a slap in the face for Mike Pompeo,2/16/2019,"                      For years US officials and politicians have been hyping up the ""China threat"" theory, targeting everything from Chinese trade, investment and military to bank loans, technology and even Chinese students studying abroad. What makes the world's only superpower paranoid and feel threatened by China or other countries is anybody's guess. But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to Central Europe this week is the latest example of how despicably some US politicians have been spreading canards about China and desperately trying to drive a wedge between China and other countries. Pompeo, a former CIA chief, however, does not seem to have achieved much success in his designs. When he recently tried to lecture Hungarian leaders about the alleged China and Russia threat and warned that if European countries use Huawei equipment, it would make ""it more difficult for us to partner alongside them"", he was quickly brushed off by Hungarian Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Peter Szijjarto. It is indeed humiliating to those host countries for Pompeo to try to dupe them into believing that Russia and China seek to erode their sovereignty, because it suggests they don't know how to handle their relations with other countries. What Pompeo has exhibited might be part of ""American exceptionalism"" since no leaders from other countries travel the world to slander others like those of the US do. Senior Chinese officials certainly have no appetite to return the favor. A Pew Center survey released this week offered Pompeo a timely reminder of the growing global fear of the US misusing its power and influence. A median of just less than half across the 26 countries surveyed said that US power and influence pose a major threat to their countries. In 10 countries, roughly half or more of the respondents said US power is a major threat to their nations, including 64 percent who said so in Mexico. In Canada, 46 percent regard US power and influence as a major threat to their country, compared with 32 percent for Russia and 31 percent for China. Ironically, more people in France, Germany, Britain, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands, whose defense ministers gathered in Brussels this week for a NATO meeting, see US power and influence as more of a threat to their countries compared with China's power and influence. What is heartbreaking for Pompeo and many other US politicians must be Japan, a key US ally in Asia, as 66 percent of Japanese see US power and influence as a major threat to their country. Moreover, in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Tunisia, the Latin American and African countries surveyed, more people see US power and influence as a major threat compared with Russian or Chinese power and influence. What really dealt a heavy blow to Pompeo is that China's power and influence stand at the bottom of the threat list in the Pew survey despite the incessant US campaign over the past years to hype up the ""China threat"" theory. US politicians have clearly not looked at themselves in the mirror. They fabricated the ""China military threat"" theory while having by far the largest military budget as well as hundreds of military bases across the world. They accuse China of meddling in other countries' domestic politics while dropping bombs and staging coups in other sovereign nations. I probably should send Pompeo a copy of the Pew report or a mirror, or both. The author is China Daily EU Bureau chief based in Brussels. chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn         "
Washington's war on Huawei a commercial and geopolitical ploy,2/1/2019,"                          View of a Huawei store in Huaibei city, East China's Anhui province, April 28, 2018. [Photo/IC]   The indictment of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies on 13 charges by the US Justice Department on Jan 28 is nothing but the latest US premeditated move to foil China's rise in the field of high-tech.  Huawei's extraordinary success in the global telecom market, especially in developing the critical 5G technology, has prompted the US administration to take its gloves off and resort to despicable actions. They include the detention of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec 1 by Canada at the behest of the United States for alleged violations of sanctions against Iran.  Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Columbia University, described the detention as ""really part of the Trump administration's broader attempt to undermine China's economy by imposing tariffs, closing Western markets to Chinese high-technology exports, and blocking Chinese purchases of US and European technology companies"".  Frederick Kempe, president of Atlantic Council, wrote in December that the US government's targeting of Huawei was a sign of the ""accelerating tech arms race"" between the US and China.  In a leaked memo, a US National Security Council official wrote about the dangers posed by Huawei's rise to become the world's most significant supplier of 5G gear. ""We are losing,"" the memo said, noting that whoever leads in this race ""will have a tremendous advantage toward... commanding the heights of the information domain.""  The US first targeted Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company, at least five years ago when a House of Representatives Intelligence Committee report called them a national security threat, without providing any evidence. And US telecom companies AT&T and Verizon both dropped Huawei products early last year under government pressure.  However, the so-called national security concerns are merely hypothetical, with words such as Huawei ""could"" or ""may"" be used by the Chinese government to spy on other countries.  To use the same logic, people should feel a deep existential threat from the US because it possesses nuclear weapons which can destroy the planet and kill every human-being 100 times.  The US government has employed similar tactics against its allies, too. In a Jan 17 article, the Economist revealed how the US Department of Justice has subjected scores of large foreign companies to extraterritorial actions, often resulting in helping US companies. It cited the example of Alstom, a French power and transport group, which faced US legal action in 2010-15 and later sold the bulk of its assets to General Electric in a deal that was announced in 2014 and closed in late 2015.  But the US actions against China are far more sinister, as reflected in the speech by US Vice-President Mike Pence at the Hudson Institute on Oct 4, when he tried to defame China for each and every action it has taken.  Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, who knows well about China and the US, warned in a talk last September that ""we seem to be walking into another war"" and ""beginning with a trade war, developing into an investment war, before metastasizing into a new 'technology war' as China and the United States now struggle to secure the commanding heights of the new technologies that will either drive, or destroy, the economies of the 21st century.""  Sachs called the US administration, not Huawei or China, as today's greatest threat to the international rule of law, and therefore to global peace.Given these facts, European countries should firmly resist the mounting US pressure to ban Huawei in their countries, as reported by The New York Times on Sunday, because the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown us the bloody results of bowing to US pressure.

'Sonic attack' by crickets reveals witch-hunting mentality of US,1/18/2019,"                          The dome of the US Capitol building at dawn in Washington, DC, US, on Dec 27, 2018. [Photo/IC]   On June 8, 2018, the US embassy in Beijing issued an alert to Americans in China to seek medical attention if they experienced symptoms consistent with the mysterious sonic attacks that have affected US embassy staff in China and Cuba. The symptoms included dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, cognitive issues, visual problems, ear complaints and hearing loss, and sleep disorder.  The United States evacuated some of the staff from its Guangzhou consulate after they complained of some of the symptoms.  The move came after similar cases were reported by US diplomats in Havana, Cuba. Without providing any evidence, the US State Department withdrew 60 percent of its staff from its Havana embassy in October 2017, and expelled two-thirds of the Cuban diplomats in Washington. US President Donald Trump and other officials accused Cuba of having targeted their diplomats with some kind of ""acoustic sonic weapon"".  US State Department press secretary Heather Nauert, who is now the US ambassador to the UN, attributed the expulsion to ""Cuba's inability to protect our diplomats in Havana as well as ensure equity and impact of our respective operation"".  In fact, China and Cuba both employed huge resources to investigate the cases but found no evidence to support the ""sonic attack"" theory, nor did the teams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation find anything.  Speculations were rife in US news media. NBC News reported on Sept 12 that US officials suspected Russia to be behind the ""sonic attacks"" in Cuba and China. Now we know that the ""sonic attacks"" were not waged by Cuba, China or Russia, which are the easy targets for US politicians.  The New York Times reported on Jan 4 that two scientists presented evidence that those sounds provided by US government officials in a recording were actually made by crickets. Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Z of the University of Lincoln in Britain even identified the culprit: the Indies short-tailed cricket.  But so far, US government officials have not commented on the shocking revelation, let alone apologizing to the Chinese, Cuban and Russian governments for damaging their reputation or inviting the Cuban diplomats back to Washington. I don't think the US expects China and Cuba to arrest the crickets and extradite them to the US to face trial, or fears that Beijing and Havana would turn them into military weapons in the future.  The cricket episode is just a reminder of the many such false accusations made against China. The US administration's allegation of Chinese interference in the US midterm elections based on some newspaper inserts even failed to convince most US news outlets, which are often in line with their government on national security issues.  Many Western politicians are not bothered to look at the facts when pointing fingers at China. Their knee-jerk reaction is that China is wrong and harbors ill intentions. And that is the conclusion they drew when Robert Schellenberg, a repeat drug smuggler, was recently sentenced to death in China for trafficking 222 kilograms of methamphetamine, without thinking that the drug could have potentially killed many people and destroyed many families.  Something sinisterly similar happened when China helped establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, and invested in Asia, Africa and Latin America to build infrastructure facilities, things that the US has shown no interest in.  Of course, European countries have responded favorably to the AIIB despite US pressure to stay away from it. At a seminar in Paris on Jan 10, French lawmakers, scholars, business leaders and former senior officials welcomed the Belt and Road Initiative while offering suggestions on how to improve it.  That is a much-needed healthy mindset in today's world.  The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.  chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn         "
Will downgrade prompt EU to come out of US shadows?,1/11/2019,"                          A European Union flag is seen outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Nov 14, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   European Union officials and politicians have been outraged since learning the US State Department quietly downgraded the EU's status from a state to an international organization at least six weeks ago.  It all happened when EU Ambassador to the US David O'Sullivan, usually among the first 30 foreign envoys to be seated, watched as he was among the last to be called at the funeral of former US president George H.W. Bush in early December.  Brussels feels ""big brother"" has humiliated, even betrayed it. While some EU politicians are appealing Washington to resolve the issue, the current episode is just a bitter reminder that disagreements between the two transatlantic allies are many and growing fast.  The EU has opposed many major actions taken by the United States administration in the last two years. These include the US withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, and its decision to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Just like the downgrade, the US administration did not even bother to notify the EU before announcing its plan of withdrawal from the INF Treaty, a treaty with Russia that is critical to European security.  The EU strongly protested the US' unilateral and protectionist trade policies when the White House imposed punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last year, including those from the EU, in the name of national security. As a US ally, the EU found it hard to understand how it could pose a threat to US national security.  At the World Trade Organization, the EU has joined China, India and some other countries to fight the US which has been blocking the appointments of judges to the WTO's court, known as the Appellate Body.  For leaders of the EU, which faces one of the biggest crises, US President Donald Trump's support for Brexit and his earlier remarks that the United Kingdom will be ""better off"" without the EU added fuel to the fire.  No wonder German Chancellor Angela Merkel said repeatedly last year that Europe cannot rely on the US to maintain the world order and protect Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron, too, is deeply upset with the US president. Shortly after Trump declared himself a nationalist, Macron said ""nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism"" at the World War I Armistice Centennial Commemoration in Paris in November with Trump among the audience.  Trump has indeed shown little regard for the EU. He has charged that the EU was established in order to take advantage of the US in trade. He has even said that ""nobody treats us much worse than the EU"".  A Pew Research Center survey shows that across Europe, the ratings for the US have been plummeting and anti-Americanism is on the rise. For example, only 14 percent of French people said they had confidence in Trump's international leadership.  The major disagreements between the EU and the US, however, go way back before Trump became US president. Europeans were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War launched by former US president George W. Bush. They also condemned the rampant US military drone strikes in South Asia and the Middle East under the Barack Obama administration.  The good news is that the EU has started to wake up to act independently rather than blindly following the US as it has done for decades. For instance, the EU did not bow to US pressure to quit the Iran nuclear deal. Instead, it has taken countermeasures to thwart the renewed US sanctions.  But the EU should do more in this regard, including rejecting the mounting US pressure in limiting high-tech cooperation with China, a huge win-win opportunity for China and the EU.

Income gap an acute issue for many nations,12/14/2018,"                          A protester wearing a yellow vest with the message, ""Macron Resign"" takes part in a demonstration of the ""yellow vests"" movement in Nice, France, December 8, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The meeting I was attending in a venue near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Friday and Saturday last week was abruptly cut short, as expected, due to a gilets jaunes, or yellow vest, protest. The graphic scenes from the previous weekend that were broadcast on TV time and again-burning cars, looting, and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets-were scary.  Friends had advised me to stay at the hotel and not go near the protest. But they were advising the wrong person, a journalist whose instinct and duty would suggest otherwise.  As I set out toward the Champs-Elysees early on Saturday morning, I met many yellow vests on their way there. They were from different parts of France, such as Normandy and Corsica. Their anger was written on their faces as I chatted with them, despite my limited French and their limited English.They were indeed furious with the new fuel tax that President Emmanuel Macron proposed early in the year, but they were more outraged with the income inequality and poverty they are trapped in.  Without much prior knowledge about social inequality in France, I was shocked to learn of their frustration at Macron, whom I actually admire.  Most Chinese know France as a rich nation and are unaware of the huge group of people who can't make their ends meet, a situation that is usually associated with developing countries.  Those I spoke to said the heavy tax burden was a major trigger for the protests. Data from Eurostat, the European Union's statistical body, shows that the tax-to-GDP ratio rose across Europe in 2017, with France topping the list of its tax revenue and making up 48.4 percent of its GDP. Belgium follows with a tax-to-GDP ratio of 47.3 percent.  Undoubtedly European countries must effectively address their worsening income gap or face a ""revolution"" as some yellow vest protesters have called their ""leaderless"" movement.  The yellow vest movement is reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street movement that erupted in New York City in September 2011 and swept US cities the following year. I was on the Brooklyn Bridge on Oct 1, 2011, when New York City Police arrested 700 protesters.  It was a controversial arrest despite the NYPD saying it had warned the protesters beforehand. As someone walking backward and taking photos of the demonstrators, I could tell that only those marching at the very front could have heard the warning, not the many hundreds that followed.  The OWS movement was just protesting against the widening income gap and corporate influence in US politics, yet it was crushed by heavy-handed policing. Many of those protesters later became supporters of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.  The income gap in the United States is higher than other advanced economies and has also increased more rapidly in recent decades. The Gini coefficient in the US, which stood at 0.435 in 2016, was the highest of any of the G7 countries, which ranged from 0.330 in France to 0.388 in the UK, according to a Pew survey released in July.  News reports reveal that the top wealthiest 1 percent in the US owns 40 percent of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 80 percent own only 7 percent.  In the past decade, income disparity has also widened rapidly in emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa. It is a pressing issue in many countries, and one that calls for urgent attention and effective action.

Climate inaction should be seen as crime against humanity,12/7/2018,"                      People take part in the Claim the Climate march in Brussels, Belgium, on Saturday to demand action at the United Nations conference on climate change in Poland. [Photo/Agencies]   The huge crowd turnout at the ""Claim the Climate"" march in Brussels on a wet Sunday afternoon came as a big surprise to me because the Belgian capital has a population of just a little more than 1 million.  The Cinquantenaire Park, where the protesters finally gathered, was packed with people of all ages, worried about their own future and that of their children and grandchildren. Local media estimated about 70,000 people attended the march.  In an awakening report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October, the world's top climate scientists warned that there is only a dozen years left to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5C-beyond which each 0.5C increase will significantly worsen the risks of droughts, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people on the planet. The scientists called for urgent and unprecedented changes to reach the climate target.  The demonstrators in Brussels were responding to the IPCC call in urging their government and the world to take immediate action against climate change. The march was organized to coincide with the beginning of the UN Climate Conference in Katowice, Poland, where leaders and representatives of some 200 countries are meeting to help put the Paris Agreement into real action.  The Paris climate accord, adopted in December 2015, set a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by drastically reducing emissions while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to within 1.5C.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has sent many tweets on climate change in the past weeks. On Tuesday, he announced to hold a UN Climate Summit in New York during the week of the UN General Assembly in September next year with the goal of raising real ambition, and promoting transformative action in the real economy and an unprecedented citizen and youth mobilization.  There is no doubt that US President Donald Trump's decision last year to pull out the US from the Paris Agreement has greatly hurt the cause. The US was the largest greenhouse emitter before 2006 and its per capita emission is still more than twice that of China.  Last month, Trump even cast doubt on the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a report by his own government in which experts warned of the devastating effects of climate change. The report lists the adverse impact of climate change on US communities, economy, agriculture, water, infrastructure, health, indigenous people and coasts.  ""I don't believe it,"" Trump reportedly said in response to the report.  In a recent article, Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said that those leaders who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity.  In Poland on Monday, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger told the audience that Washington's leadership is ""a little bit backward"" and people should look at US cities and states which are taking actions against climate change.  China and India are major supporters of the Paris climate accord. But the two largest developing nations also face huge challenge in fighting climate change. In a report on Wednesday, the World Health Organization estimated that 1 million lives could be saved through reduction in air pollution alone. The benefits would be higher in countries key to tackling global emissions, such as China and India, according to the WTO report.  There is no doubt that all countries have much to do to combat climate change before it's too late.  The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.         "
Europeans angry with policies of Trump's America,11/17/2018,"                      [Photo/Agencies]   Many Europeans hold US President Donald Trump in disdain for his views. Thousands of people protested against his visit to Britain in July and some British politicians called for him to be banned from entering the country because of his administration's discriminatory immigration policies.  Their rejection of what he stands for was fully exhibited on Sunday when Trump joined world leaders in Paris to mark the centennial of the end of World War I, only to hear French President Emmanuel Macron who said under the Arc de Triomphe that ""nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism"". It was a message directed at Trump, who recently claimed to be a nationalist.  On Wednesday, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux also publicly denounced Trump for displaying a lack of ""common decency"" after the US president took to Twitter to attack Macron on Tuesday, when the French were mourning the anniversary of the 2015 Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people and injured more than 300.  On that sensitive day for the French, Trump sent multiple tweets attacking Macron's idea of Europe building its own army, including mocking the French experience in the two world wars. ""They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along,"" Trump tweeted.  He then assaulted Macron's low approval rating, France's high unemployment rate and even wine tariffs. Trump, of course, did not forget Macron's poignant words in front of world leaders on Sunday and tweeted that ""… there is no country more Nationalist than France…"".  The US president apparently believed that he could easily browbeat Macron via his Twitter account, just like he has many domestic political opponents.  Trump, however, failed to force Macron to back off. The French president said on Wednesday that, ""Diplomacy is not made through tweets but through bilateral discussions"", another scathing remark directed at Twitter-addicted Trump.  While Trump attacked Macron for floating the idea that Europe should have its own army and not depend too much on the United States, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday that she endorsed the idea of creating an EU army.  Indeed, what happened these past days matches very well with the result of a Pew Center's Global Attitude Survey released on Oct 1. It shows strong frustration with ""Trump's America"" among key US allies in Europe.  In Germany, only 10 percent have confidence in Trump and three in four people say the US is doing less these days to address global problems. In France, only 9 percent have confidence in Trump and 81 percent think the US does not consider the interests of countries such as France when making foreign policy decisions, a common view held by the 10 EU states in the survey. In Spain, the confidence in Trump is as low as 7 percent.  And across the 10 EU nations surveyed, a median of just 43 percent has a favorable opinion of the US, something that most Americans might not be aware of or find it hard to comprehend.  Even on the issue of individual liberty, a shrinking share of people in the EU believe the US respects its people's personal freedom. The rate is 43 percent in Britain, 40 percent in France, 35 percent in Germany and 31 percent in Spain, a quite poor record for a country whose politicians like to tout how free the country is.  In this sense, the EU has already become a counterweight to Trump's America and a vital force for building a multipolar world.

EU should work harder to foil US disruptive policies,11/10/2018,"                      After learning that my new assignment is to cover the European Union, an economist friend, who holds Dutch and US dual citizenship, told me that the EU, with all its current problems and uncertainties, remains one of the more hopeful and positive political forces in today's broken world. That was my hope, too, when I landed in Brussels on Wednesday. The border control and customs officers at the airport were very friendly and efficient, disproving frequent complaints about EU inefficiency. The local weather, which I had also heard a lot about before coming to Brussels, changed from beautiful fall sunshine in the morning to strong winds and rain in the afternoon-synonymous with the world we are living in. I was thinking about heading to Paris this weekend to cover a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will be among many world leaders attending an event in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. I am no longer sure about the trip, though, after Trump said on Wednesday that he would not meet Putin this weekend, contradicting the message from Moscow. The Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki in July was a positive step toward improving relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers. But the new US sanctions against Russia that followed are a great leap backward in US-Russia ties-as is Trump's threat to pull the US out of 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, if it were to become reality. The EU, which is at the heart of the treaty, is opposed to Trump's move, and has urged the US and Russia to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve the treaty. And it warned that a new arms race would benefit no one; on the contrary, it would cause even more instability. The EU has also lashed out at the US for re-imposing full sanctions on Iran, effective on Nov 4, following Trump's decision to withdraw Washington from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In stark contrast to the US move, French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated the plan for a special financial channel, known as Special Purpose Vehicle, to continue EU-Iran trade and maintain the EU's economic sovereignty. Also, he emphasized that ""Europe refuses to allow the US to be the trade policeman of the world."" And German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday that Europe must respond to Trump's ""America first"" agenda of trade protectionism and unilateral diplomacy with ""Europe United"". Advocating an EU payment system independent of the US, in order to save the Iran nuclear deal, Maas said Europe should form a ""counterweight"" to the US whenever Washington ""crosses red lines"". Writing in the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Maas said: ""Single-handedly, we will fail in this task. The main goal of our foreign policy is therefore to build a sovereign, strong Europe."" Back in July, the EU and Japan inked their free trade agreement sending a clear message about their trade intentions to Trump at a time when he imposed high tariffs on imports from the US' major trade partners. Although the EU faces many tough challenges of its own, such as migration, Brexit and growing populism in some member states, it has proved to be a rational and important force on global issues in contrast to the US. Thanks to Trump's ""America first"" policy, the US has been quitting international treaties, neglecting its obligations, abusing its superpower status and acting unilaterally and disruptively. So Brussels has to work even harder to prove it no longer dances to Washington's tune. The author is the chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels. chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn         "
Time to change dangerous dynamic of past months,11/2/2018,"                      The phone conversation between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on Thursday was probably the most positive signal in the past months in China-US relations haunted by tit-for-tat tariff retaliations and concerns of a new Cold War between the world's two largest economies.  Their commitment to a meeting at the end of this month in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit sends another positive signal that the teams from the two sides will be working hard in the coming weeks to pave way for a successful outcome.  Despite Trump's China bashing during his presidential race, the bilateral relationship started unexpectedly well during the first year of the Trump administration when the two leaders met in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April last year and again during Trump's state visit to Beijing last November.  But that amicable relationship took a steep downturn when the US singled out China as a revisionist power in its National Security Strategy last December and followed by a series of unilateral and hawkish moves against China, including punitive tariffs on US imports from China, restrictions on Chinese investment in the US and hostile speeches on China such as the one made by Vice-President Mike Pence at the Hudson Institute on Oct 4.  Fear-mongering about China, including the Chinese news media operating in the US, the 300,000-plus Chinese students studying in US universities and colleges and various academic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, has resurged drastically.  The US has also flirted with China's core national interests. The US Congress passed the provocative Taiwan Travel Act signed by Trump on Mar 16 this year. The US also threatened Latin American and African nations which sever ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan to establish formal relations with the People's Republic of China.  The dramatic turnabout of the relationship on multiple fronts has triggered deep concern over whether the world's existing power and the rising power are heading to a new Cold War or Thucydides Trap as Harvard University scholar Graham Allison warned about.  It is no secret that China and the US have major differences. And many of those differences will probably remain for a long time to come.  No one, however, should deny that the two countries had far more differences and disagreements back in 1972 when Richard Nixon made the historic trip to China and in 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties. Yet the leaders of the two nations showed their wisdom by pursuing a path of expanding cooperation and managing and narrowing differences.  There is no doubt that the more than four decades of active engagement and cooperation have brought huge benefits for the two nations and their peoples, and has made the world a safer place, if we recall the extreme hostile relations back in the 1960s and especially the early 1950s when the two countries fought in the bloody Korean War.  As philosopher George Santayana said, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The history of China-US relations serves as a warning for those who advocate a decoupling of the two economies, arms race and other confrontational approaches.  Tackling the thorny issues between China and the US won't be easy. That is exactly why the two countries should work even harder on those issues through dialogues instead of confrontation. There is no better alternative.  China and the US shoulder great responsibility in tackling critical global issues, such as epidemic disease, climate change, peacekeeping and global governance.  Let's hope that the upcoming meeting between Xi and Trump will help reverse the course of the past months.  The author is a columnist at China Daily.         "
Global call is for US to stop being a threat to peace,10/26/2018,"                          Supporters attend the ""Rally for the American Dream - Equal Education Rights for All,"" ahead of the start of the trial in a lawsuit accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian-American applicants, in Boston, Massachusetts, US, October 14, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   Back in November 2012, I condemned the documentary Death by China based on the book Death by China: Confronting the Dragon-A Global Call to Action by Peter Navarro, then a professor at University of California-Irvine and now director of the White House National Trade Council and an assistant to US President Donald Trump.  I equated the movie to ""hate speech"" because its key points are China is bad in every respect; China is stealing American jobs, killing its babies with unsafe toys, and its army is preparing to kill Americans. I also called the movie ""garbage"" and ""akin to World War II Nazi propaganda"" that ""should never have made it to the screen"".  Sadly, slandering of China has become a favorite pastime for some US politicians, as exemplified by Donald Trump in his 2016 campaign. The HuffPost Entertainment's hilarious video Donald Trump Says 'China', in which China is mentioned 234 times, has been viewed 14.58 million times on YouTube.  For US politicians, defaming a rising China can be done at no cost to themselves, and can help energize and mislead their often less informed voters. Few US news organizations are bothered to conduct any fact checks of what they say.  That's why US politicians never tire of scaremongering about China. That's why Vice-President Mike Pence could deliver a speech targeting China redolent of the rhetoric of the Cold War at the Hudson Institute in Washington on Oct 4, a ludicrous speech that described everything China does as evil. And that's why Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began his talk in Mexico City on Oct 18 by backstabbing Chinese investment in Latin America.  The accusations that China's investment in Latin America is neocolonialism and Chinese loans in Africa are all debt traps not only betray the facts on the ground, they are insulting to those sovereign African and Latin American nations by assuming they don't know what they are doing.  The fake Bloomberg story on Oct 4, the day Pence spoke at Hudson, about Apple and Amazon products containing a Chinese spy chip could well be part of this political campaign. Apple, Amazon and Super Micro executives have all demanded Bloomberg retract the story written based on sheer speculation.  These are just some of the latest cases in which an all-out smear campaign is being conducted against China by the US.  Let me make clear that I am not claiming that China does not make mistakes or never does anything wrong. Like many developing nations, China is in the middle of a long learning process. Learning from the rest of the world has contributed hugely to China's success over the past 40 years, and China should welcome honest criticism so it can improve its development path.  But to describe everything China does as evil, as Pence did, or to denigrate China in a third country, as Pompeo did, is simply indecent behavior, especially for national leaders.  Fortunately, Chinese leaders have not demonstrated the same trait as these US politicians. Few national leaders in the world do.  Yet that does not mean they could not give a long-and factual-list detailing the hideous track record of the US, which would include the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and the thousands of innocent civilians killed as ""collateral damage"" in US military drone strikes.  China, despite all the accusations by the US, has never done anything remotely as destructive to world peace as the US war in Afghanistan, which is now in its 17th year and has become the longest war in US history.  Global polls, including by Gallup, have shown repeatedly over the years that the US is considered the greatest threat to world peace. It's clearly time for these narcissist US politicians to look at themselves more carefully in the mirror.  The author is a columnist at China Daily. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "

Trump has since reportedly sent at least 115 tweets denying climate change. However, climate change is not a Chinese hoax, even if Trump really does believe so.  On Oct 6, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Incheon, the Republic of Korea, approved a report calling for efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, instead of 2 degrees, above the pre-industrial level, in order to avoid extreme climate impacts such as drought and floods around the world.  The report said it would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society in order to reach that goal.  Yet its stark warning has not moved the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press published on Wednesday, Trump said he is not willing to ""sacrifice the economic wellbeing of our country for something that nobody really knows"". And that is the main reason he, after becoming president, quickly withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, which was adopted by 195 countries in December 2015.  Trump even bragged to AP how he has ""natural instinct for science"" when it comes to climate change, citing the fact that his uncle, John Trump, was a professor at MIT.  The White House clearly has a new talking point for denial these days. Speaking on Tuesday after visiting the damage caused by Hurricane Michael in Georgia, Vice-President Mike Pence said the causes of climate change have ""yet to be seen"".  This is nothing but a lie told in front of those who felt the hurricane's wrath. It betrayed the conclusion by most climate scientists that warming waters are connected to the strong storms. A NASA report found that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.  The US is by far the largest carbon polluter in history. It is now the second-largest carbon emitter in the world after China, but its per capita emissions are still more than twice that of China. And it is irresponsible to say the least for the current US administration to choose to absent the country from the global fight against climate change.  There are efforts at subnational levels, such as by the state of California led by Governor Jerry Brown, and by individuals such as billionaire Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg, to help keep the US pledge under the Paris accord.  It is good to know that Bloomberg may rival Trump in the 2020 presidential election. His win would inject much needed momentum in the global fight against climate change.  Oops, did I just interfere in the 2020 US presidential election?  The US is probably the most divided country in the world when it comes to climate change, with Republican and Democrat supporters holding starkly different views.  A Pew Research Center survey released on Monday shows that only 11 percent of registered Republican voters see climate change as a pressing issue facing the US, while 72 percent of the Democrat voters say it is a serious problem.The Trump administration, which has been spending much time waging trade wars, is not willing to seriously consider the latest IPCC report.  French President Emmanuel Macron promised last month that France won't sign trade deals with countries that do not comply with the Paris accord. That actually is something that other countries should insist on when they go into trade negotiations with the Trump administration.

UN speech reveals US' perilous worldview,9/28/2018,"                          Luo Jie / China Daily   I wrote in my column two weeks ago that if US President Donald Trump were to choose to speak at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, he would see many faces of resistance against his unilateral and protectionist policies. That proved true on Tuesday when he delivered his 35-minute speech at the UN General Assembly.  To the chagrin of the haughty US president, his excessive bragging of having ""accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country"" triggered laughter among the delegates from around the world. It is not known, though, whether he mistook the audience for his supporters attending his rallies, where he always speaks in a nationalistic tone and is so adept at spreading misinformation.  In a fact check after Trump's speech, The Washington Post pointed to 14 key claims made by Trump on the UN General Assembly podium. They are either exaggerated or false, including the claim that the US lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs and 60,000 factories after China joined the World Trade Organization.  While many in the United States tend to focus on Trump's embarrassing moment of being laughed at on a global stage, what is dangerous for the world are his disdain for the world order and attacks on global bodies such as the United Nations, the UN Human Rights Council and the WTO.  Unlike his predecessors, who often liked to claim the moral high ground in their speeches, Trump is clearly not afraid of ""going low"" in front the international community.  He even unabashedly touted his decisions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, and to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, decisions that are widely regarded as disastrous for global peace and prosperity and have been condemned by the vast majority of UN member countries.  Trump didn't shy away from threatening and coercing even poor countries, as he said the US is ""only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, (are) our friends"". He also reiterated his pledge to cut funding for UN peacekeeping forces.  To Trump, the US, the world's superpower, has been long victimized by every country in the world. ""The United States will not be taken advantage of any longer,"" he claimed on Tuesday.  This should wake up even those who still hold any illusion about Trump or his policies, as the US president laid bare his disruptive ""America First"" worldview on Tuesday.  French President Emmanuel Macron, who took the podium shortly after Trump's speech, expressed the feeling of many countries when he passionately advocated multilateralism and denounced protectionism, claiming that ""in the 21st century, we will only triumph through bolstered multilateralism"". In his 44-minute speech, the 39-year-old French leader even urged countries to stop signing trade agreements with those countries that don't comply with the Paris climate agreement, a direct challenge to Trump.  On Monday, France joined Germany, Britain, China, Russia and Iran in recommitting to the Iran nuclear deal. And the European Union is working on a special payment system for trade with Iran to counter the Trump administration's threat of imposing sanctions on economies that do business with Iran.  Trump may be hugely proud of his speech. But it's really a confession about how during his less than two years of US presidency, he has been breaking global rules and norms faster than any of his predecessors. And that includes his trade conflicts with several economies which threaten to disrupt global supply chains and dismantle the global trading system.  If Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly achieved anything, it is this: It helped rally the world against Trump's unilateralism and protectionism.

Selective use of FARA on media outlets deeply disturbing,9/20/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   The Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday that the US Department of Justice has ordered Xinhua News Agency and China Global Television Network to register as foreign agents is deeply troubling.  The Foreign Agent Registration Act, enacted in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda, has been mainly applied to lobbyists for foreign governments, and rarely used against the news media in the past decades. But that has changed over the past two years thanks to some US politicians fear-mongering about Russian and Chinese media outlets.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang was right in saying ""countries should perceive media's role in promoting international exchange and cooperation in an open and inclusive spirit"" and ""facilitate rather than obstruct media's normal work, still less politicizing the relevant issue"".  International news outlets, such as CGTN, Al Jazeera, RT (Russia Today) and France 24, have done a great job of informing the American public about the world, especially because major US cable networks don't carry world news on a daily basis. For example, CGTN America broadcasts news from around the world, compared with CNN America, which focuses on US President Donald Trump around the clock.  The revival of FARA against foreign media outlets started in earnest last year when the Department of Justice forced RT to register as a foreign agent. Some US lawmakers have accused RT and Al Jazeera of being ""anti-America"" or ""meddling in US elections"". In reality, it's simply a case of news organizations playing their role as watchdogs.  Was I ""anti-America"" when in my columns I severely criticized US foreign policy, from the Iraq War to the embargo on Cuba? Was I ""meddling in US elections"" when I agreed more with Bernie Sanders than with Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Still, to Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, what I had done was clearly ""foreign influence"" and should not be tolerated.  In sharp contrast, I have not heard the Chinese government labeling any major US news organizations as ""anti-China"" despite their often controversial and biased coverage of China.  The latest enforcement of FARA is particularly disturbing because of its selective nature. There is no indication that the Department of Justice has also asked fully government-funded news organizations from countries that are US allies to register under the law.  Instead of attacking international media outlets, which are doing Americans a great favor, US politicians should spend their time better addressing many issues in the US new media. A Gallup/Knight Foundation survey published on Sept 11 has urged the US media to restore their trust, which has been declining over the past decade. Most US adults, including more than nine in 10 Republicans, say they have lost faith in the news media in recent years, according to the study.  A Pew Center study published on Sept 10 shows that, while about two-thirds of US adults say they at least occasionally get news on social media, 57 percent say they expect the news they read or watch on social media to be largely inaccurate.  Ironically, Republicans and Democrats both say they can't even agree on the basic facts, according to another Pew survey on Aug 23.  Trump's tweets, which have 54 million followers, are full of disinformation. A fact check by CBS News on Wednesday showed Trump is wrong in claiming China is ""now paying us billions of dollars in tariffs"". The fact is, China isn't paying the tariffs. The tariffs are paid by US importers such as Ford and Walmart that either swallow the cost or pass it on to US consumers.  The Department of Justice and people such as Rubio will serve their country much better by addressing these real issues rather than waging a smear campaign against Chinese news media.

Resistance to US unilateralism has spread across the world,9/14/2018,"                      US President Donald Trump was furious to learn, courtesy the Sept 5 op-ed in The New York Times, that a force of resistance exists within his administration where some officials have vowed to thwart part of his agenda and his worst inclinations. In the days that followed, Trump has lashed out at the anonymous author, labeling his or her act as ""treason"", and tried to dig him/her out of his administration, including pressuring the Times to reveal the author's identity. Senior White House officials have rushed to deny they penned the article. While it's unclear whether Trump will be able to identify the author, he should not be surprised that there are people within his administration who are opposed to his policies. Just take a look at what's happening in the United States and the world beyond. At the ongoing Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, California Governor Jerry Brown is leading both domestic and global resistance against Trump's climate policies. The Sept 12-14 summit has brought together local government officials, business leaders and NGO chiefs who are against Trump's environmental policies. These people continue to push for a low-carbon economy even after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord on June 1, 2017, and later scrapped the Barack Obama-era coal emission standards. Brown has pushed for an aggressive environmental policy in his state, including signing a bill that calls for generating 100 percent of the state's electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045 and issuing an executive order requiring California to completely eliminate net emissions across the state's economy by the same year. Brown is among a group of US governors and mayors who have pledged to stick to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Under Brown, California became the first US state to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government in 2015 on regulating carbon emission. China and many other countries, too, are opposed to Trump's climate policies. China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment is co-hosting the China pavilion at the San Francisco summit to highlight the country's relentless efforts to combat climate change. China has been steadily transitioning toward a low-carbon economy by moving away from coal and investing heavily in renewable energy. China launched the world's largest national carbon trading market last year, and has planted more trees and commissioned more electric buses to serve commuters. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also been resisting Trump's climate policies with many tweets on the importance and urgency of fighting climate change. He issued a statement on Monday saying he will convene a major climate summit in 2019 to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda. Apart from the climate front, governments across the world have also been criticizing the Trump administration for withdrawing the US from the Iran nuclear deal and for threatening to punish foreign governments that don't cut imports of Iranian oil to ""zero"" by Nov 4. The US' major trade partners, such as China, the European Union, Japan and Canada, have been resisting Trump's tariff wars that are threatening the global trading system and global economic growth. The list goes on. When Trump presides over the UN Security Council in New York this month as chair of the council, he would see many faces of resistance against his unilateral and protectionist policies, including from close US allies in Europe. He would see many more such faces if he chooses to speak at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly that opens on Sept 18 and would be attended by 193 member states.

New investment law of the US discriminates against China,8/31/2018,"                          A Boeing factory in South Carolina, US, employs about 7,000 workers. China is Boeing's largest commercial market, with one in four planes delivered to Chinese customers. [Photo by Wang Ying/Xinhua]   The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, signed by US President Donald Trump on Aug 13 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, is a hostile law against Chinese investment.  Despite statements by some White House and Congressional leaders that FIRRMA does not target China specifically, the ulterior motive was evident at the Aug 23 roundtable on FIRRMA, where Trump and several lawmakers had a field day demonizing Chinese foreign direct investment. Every participant at the roundtable singled out China, mentioning it at least 15 times.  FIRRMA has expanded the power and scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency that screens foreign FDI for national security concerns. The law makes CFIUS filing for certain categories of transactions mandatory, expands the areas of transactions subject to CFIUS jurisdiction, and enhances the CFIUS's power to delay, block or unwind transactions deemed a threat to US national security interests.  Under FIRRMA, the CFIUS's scrutiny also covers sales and leases of real estate in proximity to US government facilities and sales of US companies deemed ""critical technology"" and ""critical infrastructure"". Such vague concepts leave much room for the opaque CFIUS to target Chinese investors.  While the law does not specify China in most provisions, Chinese FDI in the US is likely to face the toughest scrutiny by the CFIUS.  This has already been the case. Over the past years, more Chinese FDI has been reviewed and blocked in the US than from any other country. Last September, Trump ordered the blocking of the $1.3 billion acquisition of US chipmaker Lattice by Canyon Bridge. In February this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the acquisition of the Chicago Stock Exchange even though the deal had been approved by the CFIUS.  Trump's order in May to block the $117 billion acquisition of Qualcomm by Broadcom, a Singapore-based company, was also based on wild speculation that China might have something to do with the deal.  What FIRRMA does target China explicitly is its requirement for the US commerce secretary to provide information biannually for the CFIUS and Congress on Chinese FDI in the US. Besides FIRRMA, the National Defense Authorization Act includes the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 that controls exports and outbound transfers of technology. The US export control regime, a legacy of the Cold War, has long been discriminative against China. Many rules, as a former US Commerce Department official in charge of the issue told me during a chat, are outdated and laughable in today's world.  Yet for the Trump administration and some lawmakers, the Cold War may never end. Their unwarranted fears over Chinese FDI are in sharp contrast to the fervor of US governors and mayors who lead trade missions to China every year to woo Chinese investment and trade.  According to the Rhodium Group, Chinese FDI now supports about 150,000 US jobs. And an Oxford Economics study shows China-US trade supports 2.6 million jobs in the US. But the hostile US policies have dampened the enthusiasm of Chinese investors, as seen in the sharp fall of Chinese FDI in the US in the first half of this year and the smaller size of the Chinese delegation attending the SelectUSA in Washington in June, although China's control of capital outflow is another major factor.  FIRRMA is a major setback for the investment environment in the US at a time when China is increasingly welcoming foreign investment by easing its restrictions and implementing its new negative list on foreign investment on July 28, which reduces the number of items covered from the 63 to 48. As such, Trump's move will only end up harming the US economy.  The author is a columnist at China Daily. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
"Time for Trump to heed advice, 'to jaw-jaw is better than to war-war'",8/24/2018,"                      The talks between China and the United States in Washington this week prompted sighs of relief despite the fact that they are unlikely to put an end to the trade tensions between the two countries.  The timing is not that great because the US imposed punitive tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday, and China retaliated dollar-for-dollar with tariffs on US imports on the same day. That is in addition to the 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of goods the two countries imposed on each other on July 6.  The timing also is not ideal because with the approaching midterm election, US President Donald Trump will continue to play politics by ""getting tough on China"" and blaming China for his country's economic woes. This is especially true when Democrats are likely to gain an upper hand in many Congressional districts now held by Republicans.  The erupting scandals this week of Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty to tax fraud and campaign finance violations and Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort being convicted of tax and bank fraud charges also mean Trump will be happy to use China to divert attention from them.  By reviving tariffs on $50 billion Chinese exports, Trump broke the agreement reached after the two countries' talks in late May, the decision being announced just days after the US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the looming trade war with China would be put on hold.  While this breach of promise has complicated bilateral talks, it is always better jaw-jaw than to war-war as Winston Churchill observed.  For decades, China and the US have maintained high-level dialogues to address each other's concerns. These mechanisms, such as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, have not solved all the problems in their relations overnight, but they have contributed greatly to the generally relatively stable development of the bilateral relationship by making incremental progress.  Who on earth thinks that the major differences between China and the US can be resolved overnight?  I have covered many of those meetings over the years, and can say that just enabling representatives of the two sides to get to know each other makes those meetings worthwhile, because that makes it easier for them to communicate and coordinate once the top leaders set the tone.  Frictions are bound to exist given their fast expanding relationship. It means that the two sides need to talk to each other more, not less, and they should definitely not resort to unilateral actions that escalate tensions à la Trump's punitive tariffs.  Trump clearly believes that the US can gain a trade advantage by weaponizing its economic might.  Some US officials believe that the current strong US economy and low unemployment make this the perfect time to wage a trade war. They revel in other economies taking a hit, such as the fall in share prices on the Shanghai Stock Exchange or the dramatic depreciation of the Turkish lira.  Such gloating over other's misfortunes is not only sickening but also shortsighted. What Trump and his trade hawks have been doing is simply shooting themselves in the foot. US businesses, farmers and ranchers and consumers have already become collateral damage in Trump's attacks on China's trade and that of other US trade partners.  The US Federal Reserve warned this week that the escalation in international trade disputes was a potentially consequential downside risk for real economic activity and that wide-ranging tariff increases would reduce the purchasing power of US households.  All these suggest that the US should rely on talks, not tariffs, to resolve the trade disputes with its partners.  The author is a columnist at China Daily.         "
Trump finding it harder to fool people over trade,8/17/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump waves to the news media while walking across the South Lawn after arriving in Marine One from a recent trip to New York at the White House in Washington, US, August 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   It is puzzling why US President Donald Trump's interpretation of the US trade deficit with China differs starkly from that of almost all economists. His declaration that trade wars are good and easy to win is a clear contradiction to the reality on the ground.  A Quinnipiac University poll released this week may provide some clues. It shows that Trump may be losing support from ""uneducated white voters"", referring to those without a college degree.  It is not a crime to not have a college degree, but what Trump has been doing is to cash in on people's ignorance about trade.  On Wednesday, the US president again glorified his trade policy by tweeting that ""Our Country was built on Tariffs, and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals...""  This follows his multiple tweets on Aug 5 claiming ""Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated..."", ""Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry"" and ""Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion...""  Trump also said in an Aug 11 tweet that he is ""looking forward to dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple.""  It is unclear whether Cook explained to him that night about how trade works and why the bilateral trade deficit does not matter, using the iPhone as an example. The iPhone accounted for $15.7 billion, or 4.4 percent, of the US trade deficit with China in 2017, but most of that was contributed by companies in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany and the United States.  The International Monetary Fund has warned that Trump's tariffs are a big threat to the global economy including the US economy. Oxford Economics lead economist Adam Slater has called Trump's tariffs a ""significant"" threat to world growth and said they could reduce world trade by 4 percent and wipe away 0.4 percentage points of global GDP, about $800 billion.  Trump may use the collected tariffs to pay off the mounting national debt, but US exporters are having to pay hefty retaliatory tariffs. Besides, US companies based in China are paying the punitive tariffs Trump imposed on China under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, because they are among the major Chinese exporters to the US. In this sense, Trump is literally taxing US companies.  This is true also because a large portion of the US tariffs on China are on intermediary goods that US companies rely on.  US farmers and ranchers, who are among Trump's supporters, are also suffering, especially as the autumn harvest season approaches.  Element Electronics, a rare US TV maker, recently announced it was closing its plant and laying off all its workers in Fairfield County, South Carolina, a victim of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum and on components from China.  The tariffs are so bad that even Harley-Davidson, once Trump's favorite company, wants to move its US production to Europe to avoid retaliatory tariffs.  The general consensus among economists and trade experts is that tariff is a tax on consumers. It will drive up the US dollar and hurt US exports. Many worry that if Trump carries out his escalating tariff threats it might even cause a global recession, just like the notorious protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which was signed into US law in 1930 and blamed for exacerbating the Great Depression.  Trump's tariffs are bad for the US and the world. The Quinnipiac University poll suggests that even the ""uneducated"" won't be easily fooled.

US intimidation won't succeed in bringing nations to their knees,8/10/2018,"                          An Iranian man walks in front of a currency exchange shop in the Iranian capital Tehran on August 8, 2018. [Photo/VCG]   The Donald Trump administration reimposed a first batch of economic sanctions on Iran this week while continuing to wage trade wars against the rest of the world. What the sanctions and punitive tariffs have in common is the belief that the United States, given its economic and military might, can bring other nations to their knees through coercion and bullying.  History, however, has proven that such tactics fail most of the time. The US has imposed an embargo on its small island neighbor Cuba for 60 years, yet the embargo, called a blockade by Cubans, has not crumbled the Cuban government.  The same is true for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which has also been heavily sanctioned by the US government over many years. The joke in Washington among some Korean Peninsula experts is that many US politicians think the regime in Pyongyang will have collapsed when they wake up the next morning. That has proven wrong day after day and year after year.  Iran, too, has survived decades of brutal US sanctions.  I have not yet been to Iran and the DPRK but I have visited Cuba three times. What the US sanctions have achieved there is impoverishing the Cuban people, especially women and children.  The US sanctions have failed to achieve their purpose of bringing these countries to their knees. It is naïve to believe that nations will simply surrender if the US puts pressure on them. On the contrary, it often unites their people and makes them stronger, as a Chinese proverb from 2,000 years ago says: ""Brothers fighting at home will unite to fight against an outsider together.""  The Chinese fought against the US in the bloody Korean War in the early 1950s despite the fact that the US had the absolute military supremacy. So it is wishful thinking that the US can force China to cave in with its bullying tariff tactics.  It is disappointing that US pundits, while criticizing Trump's trade wars and reimposing economic sanctions on Iran, have not used words like coercion, intimidation, blackmailing and bullying to describe his behavior. They would not hesitate to use such words if it were China or Russia committing such actions against other nations.  The US has long put itself beyond the international community and the United Nations. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US has reneged on its international obligation by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. What's worse is that it wants to punish other nations which abide by the deal endorsed by the UN Security Council.  If such high-handedness is left unchecked, it will set a bad precedent for the international community and endanger the authority of the United Nations.  This is not to mention that trade wars and economic sanctions, especially the second batch to be put in place in early November on Iranian oil, will cause great damage to the global economy, oil markets and the livelihoods of ordinary people, including Americans.  China has made it clear that it is always opposed to such unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. Russia and the European Union, including France, Britain and Germany, which are also parties to the JCPOA, have also opposed the reimposed US sanctions.  The international community should form a united front against such US intimidation and bullying. It should send a clear message to Washington that Trump's unilateral sanctions and punitive tariffs are a great threat to the global community and they will not let him succeed.

'America First' policy dooms US' Indo-Pacific strategy to failure,8/3/2018,"                          US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [Photo/IC]   While US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's elaboration on a free and open Indo-Pacific at a business forum in Washington on Monday, two days before he embarked on a trip to Asia, was not short of lofty words and promises, it did lack honesty, sincerity and substance.  In defining the strategy, Pompeo said the United States seeks ""partnership, not domination"". Yet it is clear that the latter is exactly what the US does want. Having been the dominant power in the region since the end of World War II, it now feels that position is threatened by China's rise. The Donald Trump administration's so-called Indo-Pacific strategy is a rebranding of the pivot to Asia strategy of the Obama administration with the same aim of countering China's growing influence in the region, which is viewed by Washington as a challenge to its dominance.  Pompeo and other senior State Department officials have tried to depict the Indo-Pacific strategy as inclusive and not meant to contain China, but such words are not credible.  The Trump administration in May abruptly canceled its invitation to China to the Rim of the Pacific naval exercises despite the fact that China participated in the drills in 2014 and 2016 when tension in the South China Sea was much higher.  The tension is substantially lower now, with China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations actively pursuing a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. The US, not a claimant to maritime territories there, should not sabotage the peaceful settlement of disputes.  Make no mistake. China, as the world's largest trading nation, has more at stake than any other country in ensuring freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.  Pompeo talked about committing US investment in the region's infrastructure. However, with the Trump administration still struggling to fund its $1 trillion domestic infrastructure initiative, such a pledge is an empty promise.  Pompeo did not mention the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank whose mission is to address the shortfall in infrastructure investment. The US is among a few countries in the region which are not AIIB members.  China's Belt and Road Initiative, a bid to build connectivity in the region and beyond, has also been supported by most countries in the region.  It is true that the AIIB and Belt and Road Initiative both have room for improvement, yet the US' doubts about them show that Washington is too obsessed with its own dominance and geopolitics rather than peace and prosperity of the region.  China-haters in Washington have been celebrating the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, especially the so-called Quad alliance, which brings together the US, Japan, Australia and India in concerted efforts to contain China.  But close observers know their interests are not aligned and it will be difficult for them to bring them into alignment. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi explicitly stated at the Shangri-La Dialogue two months ago that India seeks an ""inclusive"" Indo-Pacific and will not isolate any country, a clear message to the US.  What really undermines the entire Indo-Pacific strategy is US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy, which contradicts everything Pompeo tried to sell to the region.  By withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and UNESCO, and by disdaining the World Trade Organization and the international trade system, Trump has seriously damaged the credibility and leadership of the US in the region.  East Asian economies, which embrace globalization and multilateralism, and are well integrated in the global supply chains, stand to suffer the most from the trade wars being waged by the Trump administration.  Unable to claim the moral high ground and without the power of setting a good example for the region, the US will hardly succeed with its flawed Indo-Pacific strategy.

World should unite against US abuse of financial system,7/28/2018,"                          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and US President Donald Trump speak to the news media in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, US, July 25, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was happy on Wednesday to reach a deal with US President Donald Trump to put on hold their escalating tariff wars. Missing was a reiteration that Europe will not succumb to the US threat of an oil embargo on Iran or opposition to the re-imposition of US sanctions on Iran that was lifted after the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.  Instead, Juncker, both at the Rose Garden and the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, sent a confusing signal by talking about more energy cooperation with the United States.  This was in sharp contrast to his strong message earlier that the European Union will launch the process of activating a law that bans European companies and courts from complying with US sanctions against Iran after Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Juncker vowed at the time that his commission has a ""duty to protect European companies"" from US sanctions.  Despite that pledge, many European companies have already started reducing or are planning to reduce and even terminate their business related to the Iranian oil, following the US threat of financial sanctions on companies that don't stop their buying of Iranian oil by Nov 4.  Turkey seems the most determined to defy the US coercion with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stating on Wednesday that it goes against the independence of states to cut ties with its ""neighbor and strategic partner"" because the US demands it.  Standing up to the US threat should not be just about protecting European companies. It is more about abiding by the principle of honoring the multilateral agreement-the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action-that was endorsed by the UN Security Council.  The US has not only broken its promise by pulling out of the agreement, it is taking the entire world hostage by abusing the US monopoly in the global financial system.  Trump clearly believes in bullying and intimidation tactics. He sent an all-cap tweet on Sunday, saying ""NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.""  It was a response to a comment by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that ""America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars"", referring to the US bid to pitch Iranian people against their government.  Trump said on Tuesday that he is ready ""to make a real deal"" with Iran, but Iranian officials rebuked it by saying Iran will never take part in one-side talks following US threats.  Many have speculated that Trump's latest rhetoric may be a ""fire and fury"" moment like his tweet threatening the Democratic People's Republic of Korea months ago that ended with a summit of rapprochement in Singapore on June 12 between him and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un. However, what's happening on the Iranian front is hardly encouraging the DPRK to reach a deal with the US, a deal that Trump could ditch anytime given his record of abandoning multilateral deals in the past 18 months.  Some believe Trump's real motive on Iran is about regime change. And such message won't be received well in Pyongyang, either.  The EU, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany and Iran, the remaining signatories of the Iran nuclear deal, should unite and rally the world against Trump's unilateral sanctions on Iran.  Juncker and Trump also talked on Wednesday about the reform of the World Trade Organization, but what's urgently needed is a reform of the global financial system so that no hegemonic power can abuse it.

Trump-Putin meeting lays bare wild Russophobia in United States,7/20/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump receives a football from Russia's President Vladimir Putin during their joint news conference after a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, July 16, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   As someone who keeps a close eye on US politics, I have long found the Sinophobia among American politicians ""absurd"" and ""disgusting"". US presidential campaigns have often displayed the obsession of politicians to make China their favorite bogeyman.  However, I have to admit that in the past years, the Russophobia exhibited in the US has been even more horrifying. What happened last week reflected such maniac phobia.  US President Donald Trump, elected for his anti-establishment campaign, had to reverse the words he said at Monday's joint conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki due to the excessive backlash at home, especially from his Republican supporters.  When asked on Monday about the alleged Russian meddling in 2016 US presidential election, Trump said, he had asked President Putin, and that ""he just said it's not Russia"".  ""I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be,"" Trump continued.On Tuesday, Trump changed tack and said the sentence should have been: I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.  For people who have followed Trump, it's hard to believe this correction is his real thinking.  Those critical of the meeting probably expected their president to go to the summit and point his finger directly at Putin at the news conference and accuse him of everything from election meddling to the Ukraine crisis.  They may not realize that Putin can point a finger too. The US has more than once interfered in Russian elections, although US politicians like to call it ""democracy promotion"".  The US and its NATO allies supported the demonstrators who unseated Ukraine's elected, pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.  Many scholars believe the increased Russian support for the legitimate Syrian government is a response to the US arming of Syrian rebels to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad Syrian government.  Unfortunately, only a small group of Americans, such as Patrick Buchanan, who served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations, famed University of Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer, and Ted Carpenter, a scholar at the Cato Institute, have commented on this.  It would no doubt have pleased the Russophobes if the summit or press conference had turned out to be a finger-pointing contest between the two leaders. But that would have been a waste of such an important opportunity for the two countries to improve their deeply strained relations. And it won't help solve any key bilateral, regional and global issues that require the US and Russia to work together.  Those critical of the meeting clearly have no interest in seeing progress made on any of these issues.  About 90 percent of the world's 15,850 nuclear weapons are in the hands of the US and Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. These nuclear warheads, which could wipe out human civilization multiple times, are certainly a pressing issue.  That is why I applaud Trump for his courageous summits in rapprochement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Russia, despite my strong opposition to many of his unilateral actions, such as pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and launching a tariff war against the US' major trading partners.  US President Bill Clinton, when mediating peace between Israelis and Palestinians in the 1990s, said making compromise is a sign of strength, not weakness. Multiple US and Soviet leaders have sat down for summits even during the height of the Cold War.  The Russophobia in the US today is so bad that it has made such compromises and rapprochement between the two countries more difficult than ever. This is a threat to Russia, the US and the whole world.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Trump's actions damaged US' international leadership,7/13/2018,"                          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (center L) shakes hands with US President Donald Trump during a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, July 11, 2018. NATO leaders gather in Brussels for a two-day meeting. [Photo/Xinhua]   US President Donald Trump escalated the trade quarrel between the United States and China this week by announcing he intends to impose additional 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports worth $200 billion.  When and how the trade conflict between the world's two largest economies will end is anyone's guess. However, one thing is clear: The damage it has done to the US' image and global leadership will dwarf any victory he tries to declare. In this sense, the US has already lost ""bigly"" with its many protectionist and isolationist measures.  Trump's ignorance is staggering. He believes that trade is a zero-sum game, and that a country with a trade deficit is being taken advantage of by its trade partners.  Yet many economists and trade experts have tried to enlighten Trump over the past year, including Jason Dedrick of Syracuse University, Greg Linden at University of California, Berkeley, and Kenneth Kraemer at UC, Irvine, who wrote this week on the Trump administration's misreading of the trade deficit, such as in the case of iPhone 7.  China added only $8.50 with a battery and labor costs while most of the $240 that shows up as a Chinese import to the US is retained by Apple, and companies from Japan and the Republic of Korea. Still, imports of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus contributed $15.7 billion to last year's US trade deficit with China, a seriously distorted figure.  Yet their efforts, and those of others, have all proved to be in vain.  The US tariffs will cause great harm to the global economy and disrupt global supply chains that include not only Chinese enterprises, but companies from around the world, including many from the US. These companies and consumers all oppose and resent Trump's tariffs.  The US has lost because Trump's unilateral and protectionist actions have deprived the US of any moral high ground. It is destroying the multilateral global trading system that the US helped to set up and tried to preach since the end of the World War II.  It is just the latest such US action following Trump's withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council as well as his reported threat to pull out of the WTO.  China announced on Wednesday that it will immediately file an additional complaint at the WTO regarding the latest US tariffs. While on Monday, Switzerland joined a host of others in filing WTO cases against the US for the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in the name of national security.  Trump's unilateral actions, including his tariffs on China and many other nations, have also set a bad precedent that big powers can act wantonly and irresponsibly and bully other nations.  Trump is proud of being unpredictable, but that really means unreliability and irresponsibility that people don't expect from a superpower like the US.  That is probably why Pew and Gallup polls have showed a sharp decline in favorable sentiment toward the US around the world since Trump took office. So no matter how much money Trump can extract from China and the US' other trade partners, it will pale in significance to the losses sustained by US to its reputation and global leadership.  Trump may have been a shrewd real estate businessman and believes he can coerce other nations given the US' economic and military might, but he clearly does not realize the cost the US is paying for his administration's actions.  Perhaps Trump does not care about the US' reputation and leadership in the world. Which in itself suggests that the US has lost in the trade hostilities he has initiated against China and other major trade partners of the US.

US must recover checks and balances of its political system,7/6/2018,"                          Li Min/China Daily   Americans are proud of their system of checks and balances established by their founding fathers. But as their President Donald Trump wages a trade war against the entire world, many feel that that system is broken.  The Trump administration fired the first shots in what could evolve into a full-fledged trade war in the past months by imposing punitive tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in the name to safeguard domestic industries, and then new steel and aluminum tariffs for alleged ""national security"". Both moves triggered retaliation from US trade partners and their complaints at the WTO.  Trump seems poised now to dramatically escalate the trade disputes with additional tariffs on $34 billion Chinese goods on Friday.  Trump and his trade hawks hope that China and other US trade partners will blink first because of the escalation given the US economic might and its oversized clout in the global economic and financial system.  To their surprise, China and most US trade partners have demonstrated that they won't be blackmailed.  Most US lawmakers, the business community, farmers, ranchers and consumers oppose Trump's tariffs because those tariffs will hurt US consumers and businesses as well as those of other economies.  In Senate hearings about two months ago, I heard Pat Roberts, a Republican senator from Kansas, talking emotionally about how he was surrounded by 100 farmers and their kids voicing their deep concern about foreign retaliation against US farm products that will endanger their livelihoods.  More than 100 House Republicans implored Trump in March not to go ahead with the steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed under the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962.  Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill in March to nullify Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. ""Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster,"" he said in a statement.  Unfortunately, Flake failed to get enough attention when many believe Trump's tariff threat was a mere negotiating tactic and when the midterm election means that Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to come together.  Trump's rationale for the tariff war is that US trade partners are to blame for US trade deficit, and US trade deficit means the US is a loser and has been taken advantage of by its trade partners, all of which are refuted by economists.  Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution gives Congress the power to set tariffs on imports and to regulate commerce with foreign nations.  But in a series of trade acts, Congress has delegated most of the power to the president. The 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act gave the president growing authority to negotiate trade deals and the US Trade Act of 1974 gave the president trade promotion authority to facilitate negotiations.  With these acts, the US president can unleash a trade war that disrupts global supply chains and threatens global recession, without any checks and balances from US lawmakers, or the American people. And many US lawmakers now regret that Congress gave the president so much power on trade.  In waging such a disruptive trade war, Trump is not making America great again, but rather making the US the most despised and disruptive actor in the global system. It is the rest of the world, rather than the US, that has the moral high ground in upholding the multilateral global trading system that the US and its allies established after the end of World War II.  The US Congress and American people must regain the power to stop Trump's trade war.         "
US' disruptive actions render it a 'rogue nation',6/30/2018,"                          [Photo/VCG]   A nation is good or bad not for the reputation it enjoys but for the actions it takes  US officials and politicians who have for years excelled in calling other countries ""rogue nations"" should know the term is being increasingly applied to their own country now.  Robert Kagan, a neoconservative historian at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the May 14 edition of The Washington Post that most people assume US foreign policy would follow one of two courses: being a primary defender of the international order since the end of World War II, or pull back from overseas commitment, shedding global responsibilities and turning inward.  ""It turns out there was a third option: the United States as a rogue superpower, neither isolationist nor internationalist, neither withdrawing nor in decline, but active, powerful and entirely out for itself,"" Kagan wrote, citing US President Donald Trump's policies on trade, Iran and several other areas. He accused Trump of not merely neglecting the liberal world order, but also milking it for narrow gains.  I have long admired Kagan's wealth of knowledge but often disagreed with his interventionist views in world affairs. However, I couldn't agree more with him on the Trump administration.  The term ""rogue nation"" has come to my mind many times, such as when the US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq under President George W. Bush, when President Barack Obama dramatically escalated drone strikes on sovereign nations, when Trump ordered the cruise missile strikes on Syria last year and again this year, or now as the US continues its more than half a century of embargo on Cuba.  But my civility prevented me from using the term. The strongest language I have used against the US is: a ""threat to global rules and norms"". That was in my May 19 column, in which I listed Trump's appalling actions of withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Iran nuclear deal, cutting funding to the UN, and threatening to impose more punitive tariffs on imports and abandon trade agreements with the US' major trade partners. The US announcement last week of pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council is the latest such action.  Search results for ""US"" and ""rogue nation"" are surprising. Kagan is not alone. Mary Robinson, a former UN special envoy on climate change, said last year that the US pullout from the Paris accord ""renders it a rogue state on the international stage"". Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, too, blasted Trump for withdrawing from the accord in an article titled ""US a step closer to being a rogue nation"".  And Peter Hartcher, political and international editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, censured Trump for withdrawing from the Iran deal in a May 9 article, headlined ""Donald Trump's America has just become a rogue nation"".  If withdrawing from the Iran deal that was endorsed by the UN Security Council has made Trump's America a rogue nation, then the fresh threat it issued on Tuesday to impose sanctions against governments that don't cut imports of Iranian oil to ""zero"" by Nov 4 would make it a ""rogue superpower"", as Kagan has described it.  China, India, the Republic of Korea, Japan, France and Italy are among the largest importers of Iranian oil, and now the US, with its monopoly in the global financial system, wants to force them to follow US-devised rules that contradict those of the UN Security Council.  Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argued last week that US allies should not yet treat the US as a rogue nation despite Trump's irrational trade actions, for he believes the Congress, the business community, farmers and the public will force Trump to his senses.  Until Alden's prediction comes true, the ""rogue nation"" term would continue to describe Trump's America thanks to its innumerable disruptive actions.

          Trump and his trade hawks must be brought down to earth
        ",6/22/2018,"                           Cai Meng/China Daily   If US President Donald Trump has finally come to his senses on Wednesday by signing an executive order to reverse his administration's inhuman practice of separating children from their parents illegally for illegally crossing the southern US border, he should also be brought to his senses to stop the tariff war he has initiated with China, and, indeed, the whole world.  The past week is like a replay of April. Disregarding the consensus reached at the recent high-level bilateral talks in Washington and Beijing to end the tariff threats, the Trump administration on June 15 announced a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports, with most of the tariffs due to come into effect on July 6. Hours later, China released its retaliatory tariff list on an equal amount of US exports. Trump then escalated the tariff war by directing the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to identify an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports for a new 10 percent tariff. China has vowed to fight back with comprehensive measures.  Many believe that the Chinese will be short of retaliatory targets since China exports far more to the United States than US exports to China. But a Bloomberg report suggests that China could punish the vast US investment in China, which would hit companies such as Apple, General Motors, Starbucks and Walmart.  A Deutsche Bank Research study shows that if you count both US exports and sales within China, the US has a surplus of $20 billion with China.  There should be no concerns that China may run out of ammunition. However, it is nothing worth celebrating because such a tariff war spells disaster for both nations and the world.  Returning to China a week ago after years of covering Washington, I was asked repeatedly by people of diverse background to make sense of Trump's tariff actions.  I can't. The many US economists I had talked to, including left and right leaning and centrist, can't make sense of it either. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro is probably the only US economist who believes ""jobs and wealth are being given to other countries"", despite the rebuttals from numerous respected economists.  Benn Steil and Benjamin Della Rocca, two economists at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on Tuesday that Navarro and Trump are ""logically and historically false"" in their comments about the trade deficits of the US.  Their study proved that rising growth tends to expand US imports through high consumption. Thus the imports reflect the strength of the US economy, rather than giving jobs and wealth to other countries.  Many studies have also shown that automation and factory efficiency, rather than China, or India or Mexico, are the main reason for vast majority of jobs that have been lost in the US.  What is also true is that Trump's tariffs, which are aimed at hurting the Chinese economy and blackmailing China, will inflict enormous harm on US consumers and businesses. Tariffs on China are simply new taxes on US consumers, not to mention China's retaliatory tariffs on US exports.  The outcry by US farmers, ranchers, retailers, manufacturers, economists and bipartisan lawmakers against Trump's tariff measures shows that those tariffs, whether aimed at China or other nations, are extremely unpopular and considered irrational and irresponsible. They harm the US at the same time they hurt other countries.  Trump's tariffs are not only holding the Chinese and other economies hostage, they have seriously violated the global trade rules and norms, undermined the credibility of the US' global leadership and eroded the moral high ground the US likes to claim.  There is too much at stake. Trump and his trade hawks must be brought to their senses.  The author is a columnist at China Daily.         "
Summit critics put at risk all that has been gained so far,6/15/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump walks with the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un at the Capella hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on Tuesday. [Photo/Agencies]   I went to Singapore to cover the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un with hopes it would go well but also concern that Trump might walk out on impulse.After all, he had just withdrawn the United States' endorsement of the G7 joint statement on way to Singapore.  Not only the worst did not happen, it was such a successful summit that anyone who genuinely cares about the peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula should warmly applaud it.  Trump and Kim deserve much credit no matter how much you may disagree with them on other issues. The jubilant celebration by the Korean community in Singapore right after the summit is testimony to this.  The Republic of Korea's President Moon Jae-in praised the summit on Thursday for allowing the entire world to escape the threat of a nuclear war.  Singaporean leaders and media also spoke highly of the historic moment.  But back in the US, it has become a bickering partisan issue ahead of the midterm election. Critics have said Trump has given legitimacy to Kim, for the lack of details in the joint statement and in particular a road map to denuclearization, for making concessions or making concessions too early, such as the halt of joint US-ROK military drills, for not vocally raising the issue of human rights in the DPRK, for serving China's interests, or for making China the biggest winner, as claimed by Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Barack Obama administration official on China.  Few seem to be interested in discussing constructively how to sustain the positive momentum of the summit and make it a lasting success in achieving peace and denuclearization on the peninsula.  Why should anyone expect that issues between the US and the DPRK, which have festered for almost 70 years, to be resolved in one meeting? The lack of details in the joint statement was to be expected given each of the four areas is itself an immensely complicated undertaking.  China and the US did not resolve all the key issues when they established diplomatic ties in 1979, seven years after President Richard Nixon's icebreaking trip to China and handshake with Chairman Mao Zedong. The two countries still have many outstanding issues.  For the US and the DPRK, it is the beginning and a good beginning of a long and arduous journey.  The whole world emerged as the winner from the reconciliation on Tuesday. China is of course a big winner, having called for direct talks between the US and the DPRK for years and supported United Nations resolutions on peace and denuclearization of the peninsula. China's stance has been more consistent than any of the other parties involved.  But it is the people of the two Koreas, who are the biggest winners. They would be the victims if, the 1953 armistice no longer held and there was a renewal of the catastrophic hostilities on the peninsula. That is probably why some folks in the Korean community gathering in Singapore on Tuesday night burst into tears, they were tears of joy and hope.  It is true that no one can say with absolute confidence that Trump and Kim, given their characters, will be able to continue their cordial relations as displayed on Tuesday, but we should all have our fingers crossed they can.  Instead of whining, and making it a partisan issue in the midterm election and into the 2020 US presidential campaign, those in Washington should help advance peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

"Summit could be beginning of peace, reconciliation",6/8/2018,"                          A combination photo shows US President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-un. [Photo/Agencies]   I was walking to the National Press Building on Monday when a TV news crew stopped me and sought my comment on the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un.  They picked the right person since I am going to Singapore to cover the June 12 summit to be held at the Capella Sentosa Hotel. It will be a historic summit: The first one between a sitting US president and the top leader of the DPRK.  I applauded Trump in a column on May 20, 2016, after, the then presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said he would be willing to talk to Kim. ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" Trump said at the time.  China has long called for direct engagement between the US and the DPRK, the two major players responsible for the tension on the Korea Peninsula. The Barack Obama administration rejected such direct diplomatic engagement despite its diplomatic advances with Iran and Cuba.  The Trump administration threatened a military strike following nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK. And the ensuing war of words between Trump and Kim early this year worried many in the region about a possible catastrophic conflict that would result in the loss of millions of lives.  Tension has been dramatically reduced since March when it was announced that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet Kim. Trump later canceled the planned meeting blaming Pyongyang, saying it had shown ""tremendous anger and open hostility"". But he revived it just eight days later after the DPRK called Trump's decision ""regrettable"" and held out hopes for ""peace and stability"".  Many in the US believe the summit will immediately result in complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization by the DPRK. That's why when Trump called the summit a ""getting-to-know-you meeting,"" he drew sharp criticism within the US.  But his lowering of expectations is actually realistic. Given the decades of hostility between the two countries, which are technically still at war with each other following a 1953 armistice, there has been very little mutual understanding and mutual trust between the two countries. It is unrealistic to expect that an issue as difficult and complicated as denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which the US seeks, and the security guarantee from the US, which the DPRK has demanded in return, will materialize during the upcoming meeting.  Back in the 1970s following the ice-breaking trip to China by US President Richard Nixon in 1972, it took many years for China and the US just to normalize their relations. China-US relations have become broader and deeper in the past decades thanks to the engagement pursued by both sides. This is despite their differences on a range of issues.  Rome was not built in a day. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the reconciliation between the US and the DPRK will not be accomplished in one single meeting. Even US experts have cautioned that the denuclearization process itself could take as long as 15 years.  What it means is that the two sides should continue to actively engage diplomatically and meet each other halfway, and refrain from returning to the past war of words and exchange of military threats.  If the Trump-Kim summit in Sentosa, meaning ""peace and tranquility"" in Malay, can be the beginning of that peace and reconciliation process, it will be not only a historic summit but also a successful one.

Trump should keep the promise he made to DPRK,6/1/2018,"                      While there are some in the United States saying it will win their leader a Nobel Peace Prize, doubts have been cast on whether the planned summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un will actually take place.  The on-off-on roller-coaster has exposed a shocking lack of seriousness and preparedness on the US side, particularly on Trump's part, as to how to seize such a rare opportunity to ease the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  It is true that for the two countries to agree to the historic meeting is in itself a major breakthrough, especially if we recall the saber-rattling and war of words just months ago.  But while the DPRK has made goodwill gestures in the past weeks toward improving relations and denuclearization, by blowing up its nuclear test site and releasing three US detainees, it is unclear what concessions the US is willing or able to make going to the summit and subsequent talks.  Pyongyang has made it clear that it will cancel the summit if Washington forces it to unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons program or continues to float the Libya model.  The DPRK has long cited security concerns to justify its nuclear program. After all, a peace treaty to end the Korean War, which started in 1950, has yet to be signed by the relevant parties.  The US security guarantee must be in a formal document so that the Trump administration and future US leaders will be obliged to abide by it.  It is a lesson learned from the Libya disarmament in 2003. The Barack Obama administration and its NATO allies pursued regime change in Libya in 2011, eight years after Muammar Gadhafi gave up his nuclear weapons program.  In this sense, the US has much to do to make its security guarantee credible this time around.  The US likes to blame the DPRK for all the past failures on denuclearization. But certain US government actions-such as when the US government stopped shipping oil to the DPRK as agreed upon and former president George W. Bush calling Pyongyang part of an ""axis of evil""-were much to blame for past setbacks.  Key in the security assurance is the DPRK's long-standing opposition to the massive US troops stationed in the Republic of Korea and their frequent joint drills on and in the waters off the peninsula.  If a peace treaty to end the Korean War is signed, it does not make sense for the US to continue to deploy those troops on the peninsula. Holding regular military exercises aimed at the DPRK would become unnecessary provocations.  Many US politicians and the military-industrial complex do not want to see a de-escalation of tensions on the peninsula, let alone a unified Korea, because that would take away the justification for such a US military presence there.  The phasing out of UN sanctions and US unilateral economic sanctions on the DPRK, while a reasonable expectation for the DPRK, will unfortunately be extremely challenging politically at home for Trump. China has long advocated direct contact between the DPRK and the US to ease tensions. China does not oppose Korean reunification because no one else in today's world better understands the term ""reunification"" than Koreans and Chinese.  The Chinese would applaud a reunified Korea as a peaceful, prosperous and friendly neighbor. But China would not like to see a reunified Korea that becomes a US puppet and is used as a geopolitical tool by the US against China.  The ball is now in Trump's court.

US a real threat to global rules and norms,5/19/2018,"                          Luo Jie/China Daily   The Donald Trump administration has isolated the United States, even from some of its close allies, by taking actions that challenge international rules and threaten world peace  For years, many US officials and politicians have been trying, albeit with ulterior motives, to portray China as a rising power which challenges international rules and norms, but judging by what we've seen in the past years, especially past weeks, no country deserves the title of a coercive and disruptive power more than the United States.  The fact that the more than 60 Palestinian civilians killed, including six children, and the over 2,000 injured by Israeli forces were part of the protesters demonstrating against the shifting of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday makes the US directly responsible for the deaths and injuries and the overall mayhem.  The decision to shift the US embassy, announced by US President Donald Trump in December, not only breaks with decades of Washington's foreign policy but also violates United Nations Security Council resolutions that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of Israel and Palestine. Fittingly, the UN General Assembly denounced Trump's decision in December despite US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley's open threat to UN members who ""disrespected"" the US on the issue.  The embassy decision not only shows that the US cannot be an honest mediator in the Middle East, especially between Israelis and Palestinians, but also demonstrates that the US is a major destabilizing force in the region.  While Trump claimed on Monday that ""our greatest hope is for peace"", what's happening on the ground suggests otherwise. Trump has opened a second Pandora's box in the Middle East in just one week. Trump's announcement on May 8 to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is clinching evidence of the US' inability to honor a multilateral deal. The UN Security Council unanimously endorsed the deal, after it was reached on July 14, 2015, between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council-the US, China, Russia, Britain and France-plus Germany and the European Union.  The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly affirmed in the past years that Iran has been complying with the deal. Other parties to the agreement, including the US' close allies in Europe, had tried to dissuade the US from abandoning the deal. But to no avail.  Right after Trump announced the US' withdrawal from the deal, tensions flared up between Iran and Israel, with the two sides firing missiles on each other's targets.  These are just the latest US actions that have violated international rules and norms.  In August 2017, the Trump administration notified the UN that it intends to withdraw from the Paris climate accord reached by more than 190 countries in December of 2015 to fight carbon emissions. Incidentally, the US is historically the largest carbon emitter and its per capita emission is still more than twice that of China's.  In October, the US State Department announced the US would withdraw from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at the end of 2018. The US stopped funding the organization in 2011 after UNESCO admitted Palestine as a full member, and its decision to pull out of the UN body reflects a desperate move after it failed to coerce UNESCO to make changes according its demands.  This is not the first time the US has done this, though. The Ronald Reagan administration had withdrawn the US from UNESCO in 1984 saying it was excessively influenced by the Soviet Union. The US had its full membership restored only in 2003 when George W. Bush was US president.  Also, in December 2017, the US announced it would cut $285 million in funding to the 2018-19 UN budget, just days after 120 countries condemned Trump's decision to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The funding cut poses a threat to the UN missions for peacekeeping, environmental protection, humanitarian assistance and public health, issues that are very important to global stability and peace.  Moreover, Trump has called the World Trade Organization ""a disaster"" for the US and has threatened to break the WTO by imposing protectionist tariffs on imports, and thus violating international trade rules. This is despite the prevalent experts' view that the US and many other countries are the prime beneficiaries of WTO that deals with the global trade rules.  To Trump, who is trying desperately to promote his ""America first"" policy, every deal the US has inked in the past, whether bilateral or multilateral, is a bad deal if not the worst deal ever for the US. That is why the Trump administration has been blaming almost every major US trade partner for taking advantage of the US, despite the fact that the US has long been using its dominance in the global financial system, its economic power and military might to intimidate other countries, irrespective of whether it deems them adversaries or allies.  Both Canada and Mexico, for example, have complained about the US' bullying tactics while renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was originally signed in 1994. In March, the Trump administration threatened new steel and aluminum tariffs if Canada and Mexico didn't agree to its revisions to NAFTA. And on May 11, Trump called NAFTA ""a horrible, horrible disaster"" for the US.  Trump has also made unilateral moves that threaten the free flow of trade and investment between the US and China, which include such unreasonable demands as China should reduce its trade surplus with the US by $100 billion each year for the next two years and the Chinese government should stop ""subsidizing"" its industries. Almost all economists emphasize that the US trade deficit is a result of its fiscal policy and American people's low savings rate, and that the US and many other advanced countries, too, subsidize their industries.  Last week, David Gergen, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to several former US presidents, described Trump's actions as ""bullying China"".  As a real estate businessman-turned-politician, Trump should know that honoring a deal matters more than anything else in economic relations. Otherwise, why should anyone trust him or the US in any future negotiations? And among the deal he should honor, a very important one is his planned meeting with Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, which incidentally is a rare positive step taken by Trump.  While the latest developments have created uncertainties for the planned meeting, the US is suffering a credibility crisis after its decisions to pull out of and renegotiate so many major deals, especially its decision to pursue regime change in Libya in 2011 even after Muammar Gadhafi had abandoned his nuclear weapons program.  There are a lot more hurdles to be cleared, more on the US side than on the DPRK side, to show what kind of compromises they are willing or able to make given the long-standing hostility and distrust between the two countries.  So far, most critics have used unilateralism and isolationism to describe Trump's actions. Indeed, the US has been quite isolated, even from some of its close allies, for taking actions that have disrupted and challenged international rules and norms and are threatening world peace.  It's important therefore for Trump to know that his disruptive actions run contrary to his slogan of ""Make America Great Again"", as they will ""make America less great"".

White House up to its tricks with some nonsense quite a lot,5/11/2018,"                          Photo shows a commemorative envelope themed on ""Chinese air force conducts island patrols around Taiwan"". The Chinese People's Liberation Army air force released a promotional video and commemorative envelopes, recapping its recent flights over China's island of Taiwan, on April 28, 2018. [Photo/Xinhua]   In a statement last Saturday, the White House described China's caution that foreign airlines should not refer to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as independent countries as ""Orwellian nonsense"".  But it is the statement itself that is nonsense. The letter by the Civil Aviation Administration of China to 36 foreign air carriers is simply trying to correct a mistake that has existed for too long.  Who on earth still thinks the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative region or Taiwan are independent countries? Since China and the US established formal diplomatic ties in 1979, even the US government does not think so.  So why does the White House still make a fuss about the issue by ignoring plain and simple facts?  On Jan 12, The Paper, a Shanghai-based news publication, reported that at least 24 foreign airlines still list Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as countries, rather than using the term ""regions"", which Chinese prefer. The story went viral among Chinese netizens.  Yes, given the country's recent history, Chinese are sensitive to such issues. Macao was for too long occupied by the Portuguese, Hong Kong was forced to be ceded to the British, and Taiwan was forced to be ceded to the Japanese.  International companies know that in order to succeed, they need to be sensitive to the feelings of the local populations where they operate. In this case, foreign airlines that were not aware of this sensitivity before should seriously heed CAAC's advice.  Such advice applies not only to corporations, but also to every individual. When starting to learn English in elementary school, I was taught to refer to people from the United Kingdom as British, not English, because they could be Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish, many of whom don't want to be called English.  Referring to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as a country goes beyond insensitivity, it's about basic facts.  Would the White House or average Americans feel okay if others start to describe Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Alaska or Texas as independent countries, because there have long been independence movements there?  After spending a year in Hawaii in the early 1990s, I learned that the Hawaiian sovereignty movement has been alive since 1893, when the US overthrew the Hawaiian kingdom. In 1993, both the US Congress and then US president Bill Clinton apologized to the native Hawaiians for the illegal annexation.  A Puerto Rican independence movement has also existed ever since the US seized the territory from the Spanish in 1898. I have made three trips to the Caribbean island and love its people, culture, history, beaches, coffee and its ""un-American"" metric system.  However, news from the beautiful island after Hurricane Maria last September has been heart-breaking. Not only have so many people been living without power month after month, the federal government of the world's only superpower has not exactly been going all out to help the disaster-stricken population. It is shameful.  I could go on and on with the independence movement in Alaska, Texas or even Vermont. But of course, the US Constitution does not allow any state to declare independence.  And most Americans may find it hard to understand the feelings of Chinese on the matter. After all, US history over the last 150 years has been a constant annexation of territories from Asia to Latin America.

China and US will benefit by putting trade ties on the right track,5/4/2018,"                        Before the US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing to discuss a host of trade and investment issues on Thursday and Friday, the right atmosphere should have been created to make the talks productive.  But that atmosphere was poisoned after the United States unleashed a series of protectionist measures, including tariffs on solar cells and modules as well as washing machines announced in January, steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in the name of national security in March, and the proposals to slap tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese imports under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.  The unilateral US actions are widely seen as a violation of the rules of the World Trade Organization, and these first shots fired by the US have triggered grave concern about the future of the multilateral global trading system.  The list of trade and investment issues between the two largest economies could be very long, but the correct approach is to address them through talks and negotiations and the existing multilateral system.  The opposition to US tariffs and other protectionist measures has been voiced not just by US trade partners, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during their recent visits to Washington, but by many in the US as well.  The US-China Business Council, which represents 200 US companies doing business in China, released a report on Monday emphasizing the great benefits the US gains from its trade with China. Exports of US goods to China hit a record $128 billion and grew much faster than US exports to the rest of the world. US exports to China also support 1 million US jobs.  On Tuesday, the US National Retail Federation and Consumer Technology Association released a study showing the proposed US tariffs on imports from China and the retaliation promised by China would cost hundreds of thousands of US jobs and greatly harm the US economy.  Specifically, the report said the tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese imports, along with the Chinese retaliation, would decimate 455,000 US jobs and shrink US GDP by $49 billion if implemented, with US farmers bearing the brunt of the trade actions. According to the report, the net income of US farmers would decrease by 6.7 percent and 67,000 agriculture jobs would be lost.  The Brookings Institution also released its Export Monitor 2018 report on Monday, concluding that US communities that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 are more exposed to the Chinese tariffs, as measured by the share of exports in tariff-affected industries and the direct and indirect jobs those exports support.  It is true that the tariff measures, coupled with the growing US restrictions on Chinese foreign direct investment in the US, will hurt China and many other countries that are part of the global supply chains, but the US will not emerge a winner as several US reports this week have shown.  Imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese imports and stringent restrictions on Chinese foreign direct investment will only increase the costs for US consumers and deny US companies opportunities in the vast Chinese market.  The best way forward is for the two sides to sit down and address each other's concerns in an equal and mutually respectful way. Although it is unrealistic to expect many thorny issues to be solved overnight, talks, rather than unilateral actions, are the only right option.  The two countries should resume talks on the Bilateral Investment Treaty, or even start discussing the possibility of a free trade agreement to pave the way for a lasting and healthy trade and investment relationship.

"In human rights, Washington surely doesn't 'lead by example'",5/2/2018,"                          Students, teachers and parents protest in Chicago Union Park on March 24, calling on the US government to strengthen gun control and improve campus security. Wang Ping / Xinhua News Agency   The US State Department owes a debt of gratitude to China's State Council Information Office for publishing the United States' human rights record every year since 1998.  The report on US human rights record in 2017, released on Tuesday, lists many high-profile human rights violations in the US, from mass shootings, hate gatherings by white supremacists, a criminal justice system that discriminates against African-Americans and the huge wealth gap between average white and black families.  It also lists US human rights violations in other countries such as the heavy civilian casualties of US military operations, hacking websites and waging cyber warfare, and holding and torturing people without trial at the Guantanamo detention center.  New York-based Human Rights Watch, in its World Report 2018, highlights many of the same violations. It says the US moved backward on human rights at home and abroad across a range of issues in 2017. The report severely criticizes US President Donald Trump's actions on refugees and immigrants, and for calling them criminals and security threats and consistently advocating anti-Muslim ideas and policies.  Human Rights Watch also says the 2.3 million people in US state and federal jails and prisons on any given day comprise the world's largest reported incarcerated population. Nearly six times more black men are incarcerated compared with white men, and an unarmed black person is five times more likely than an unarmed white person to be killed by police.  Such chapters on human rights violations perpetrated by the US are exactly what's missing in the US State Department reports on nearly 200 countries and regions, which is a shame given that the US reports claim in the preface that ""we seek to lead other nations by example"".  The double standard and geopolitics the US employs in its report is exactly why it backfired so badly after its release on April 20. That US Acting Secretary of State John Sullivan called the governments of China, Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ""forces of instability"" because of their ""human rights"" issues is just one example of the US' geopolitical game.  Pointing out China's problems in human rights is one thing, because as a developing country, China has much to improve in this regard. But labeling China a ""force of instability"" is blowing the issue out of proportion-and that it does not fit reality at all is obvious.  At the 2018 International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual spring meeting that ended last Sunday, the message was that China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past four decades and contributed to a third of global economic growth in the past decade, more than any other country.  Those facts show China is a source of not only stability, but also prosperity for its own people as well as those across the region and beyond, not to mention China's big role in UN peacekeeping missions and the Paris climate accord. The list is long.  Sullivan should read some of the readers' comments after Agence France Presse tweeted on April 20 that ""US brands China and Russia 'forces of instability'.""  For instance, Mario Santana commented: ""I keep forgetting; was it China, Russia, Iran or ... (the DPRK) who invaded Iraq in 2003, bombed Libya in 2011, and has been arming jihadists in Syria since 2012?""  Cuanticorojo wrote: ""Really? Name a country invaded by these forces.""  ""US(has) caused more war, terror and instability on foreign land than anyone else. Don't kid yourself. And funny how it ignores Israel and Saudi (Arabia),"" said Coitnana, referring to the US' double standard.  And cappygolucky said: ""Not looking in the mirror, hey America.""  Not many will doubt the US is more deserving of the title ""force of instability"".  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
"Trump given a basic trade lesson by IMF, World Bank",4/20/2018,"                      A potential trade war between China and the United States was the focus of attention as the world's central bank governors and finance ministers assembled in Washington this week for the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual spring meeting. At the Tuesday morning news conference on the IMF's World Economic Outlook report, I asked about the possible impact of US President Donald Trump's announcement and imposition of tariffs and the threat to cancel trade deals. I was surprised, however, that journalists from Europe, Africa and Latin America all posed questions on how their regions and countries would be impacted by a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Such deep concern around the world was a key takeaway at the annual meeting. Indeed, the IMF's report warns a trade war would have a devastating effect on the global economy, which would be the true loser of a trade war. The first shots were fired when, inconsistent with the World Trade Organization principles, the US announced in March its intent to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports for national security reasons. The second takeaway was the constant mentioning in the IMF outlook report and by its officials that the multilateral mechanism, instead of unilateral actions, should be used to resolve trade disputes, a clear message directed at the US administration. The Trump administration's unilateral actions have threatened to break the World Trade Organization. US President Donald Trump has constantly attacked the WTO, including in his Tuesday's tweet saying""... Look how bad WTO is to U.S."" The Trump administration has also been blocking a new appointment at the WTO appellate body that handles dispute settlement. The third takeaway, probably a surprising one but an appropriate one, is the IMF's repeated education on trade deficits, both in the World Economic Outlook report and by its officials. This, in my view, is purely for Trump's benefit, as he continues to show little understanding of deficits, especially the bilateral deficit with China. The IMF warned that the negotiations aimed at reducing the US' trade deficit after the steel and aluminum tariffs were introduced will do little to change the multilateral or overall US external current account deficit. The reason: the deficit is largely a result of aggregate US spending that continues to exceed total income. The IMF also warned that recent US fiscal measures will actually widen its current account deficit. Higher spending and tax cuts in the US will raise its current account deficit for 2019 to above $150 billion. It is puzzling to most economists and trade experts why Trump is obsessed with his country's trade deficits, especially its trade deficit with China, and why he blames US trade partners for the deficits and equates the deficits as a loss for the US. Neither of which is right. While it is alarming that Trump does not understand Trade 101, the US president at least got the figure in the right ballpark for a change when he recently blamed China for $375 billion in US trade deficit. For months, Trump has blamed China for a trade deficit of $500 billion, saying at a March 23 news conference, for instance, that ""last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China"". That number was actually the total Chinese exports in goods to US in 2017 and did not exclude the $130 billion US exports in goods to China. And if the $39 billion US trade surplus in services with China in 2017 was included, bilateral trade deficit was only $336 billion, according to US data. The Chinese data for the bilateral deficit is even lower. It may take a while for Trump to get all the numbers right, but hopefully less time for him to heed the concerns raised at the IMF/World Bank annual meeting.

US' demonizing of Chinese FDI a shot in the foot,4/13/2018,"                          Chinese 100 yuan banknotes are seen in a counting machine while a clerk counts them at a bank in Beijing, March 30, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]   There will likely be a sharp decline in Chinese foreign direct investment in the United States in 2017, partly as a result of China's tighter control of capital outflow, but also because the US government and lawmakers increasingly view Chinese FDI through the lens of geopolitics.  That was a message from two reports on Chinese FDI in the US released by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the Rhodium Group.  The fact that Eric Chewning, US deputy assistant secretary of defense for manufacturing and industrial base policy, was the keynote speaker at the Tuesday meeting in Washington to launch the reports is both surprising and telling.  Chinese FDI in the US plunged by more than one-third in 2017, the first major correction in a decade. The value of newly announced deals in 2017 declined more than 90 percent.  An unprecedented number of Chinese deals were delayed, or abandoned in 2017 as parties failed to obtain approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which screens FDI for potential national security risks.  While the committee's shortage of staff was cited as a reason, one of the reports titled New Neighbors said a more important reason is that CFIUS has broadened its approach to reviewing Chinese deals, taking into consideration a wider array of criteria when assessing security risks. CFIUS prevented nearly $10 billion of Chinese acquisitions in 2017.  Politicization of deals and political gamesmanship may deter Chinese and other international investors, the report warned.  But such politicizing will likely get much worse when the US Congress passes the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, or FIRRMA, likely later this year. FIRRMA will greatly expand the scope of CFIUS scrutiny and target mainly Chinese investors coming to the US. Put bluntly, it is a discriminative act against Chinese investors.  Chinese investment in the US has already created nearly 140,000 direct jobs. That is why US local leaders-governors and mayors-have shown huge enthusiasm for attracting Chinese FDI, for instance, by leading trade and investment missions to China.  However, Chinese FDI is quickly politicized once in Washington. In a March 21 opinion piece, Republican Senator John Cornyn from Texas and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from California, the two who introduced the Senate bill, wrote that ""as we speak, China is using any means available to turn our technology and know-how against us and erase our national security advantage. This weaponization of investment is aimed at vaccuuming up US industrial capabilities in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics which have obvious and important military application"".  They quoted Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying that by 2025, China will pose the greatest threat to US national security of any nation.  Robert Pittenger, a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, who introduced FIRRMA in the House, similarly scaremongered about Chinese FDI on the CSPAN channel on Wednesday.  The vicious words reflect the Cold War mentality in the latest US National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy that define China as a strategic competitor and a revisionist power that threatens the US.  Already, Silicon Valley and the US electronics and semiconductor industries, which depend a lot on foreign investment, have voiced deep concerns about FIRRMA's and CFIUS's rejection of Chinese FDI in the tech sector.  There is no doubt that while US government and lawmakers demonize Chinese FDI, the US and American people stand to lose out on the great opportunities presented by Chinese outbound investment.

"Negotiation, not useless tariff threat, the way forward",4/5/2018,"                      US President Donald Trump and his Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross both tried to calm down the panic about a possible trade war on Wednesday just hours after China slapped 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion imports from the US, including soybeans, whiskey, cars and planes. Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning that “we are not in a trade war with China” while Ross told CNBC that he expects trade actions between the two countries will likely lead to a negotiated deal. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, indicated that it’s possible that Trump’s tariffs are a negotiating tactic and won’t go into effect. If this were the case, then Trump has already proved himself wrong because China has demonstrated that it can’t be coerced and is fully determined to reciprocate, as reflected in both the Section 301 and the Section 232 cases. Wielding a big tariff stick won’t gain the US more leverage at the negotiation table. By threatening protectionist tariffs, Trump has caused a major disruption in the global trading system and also put Americans in harm’s way. US consumers, farmers and blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for Trump, are hurt already as a result of the tariff war triggered by the Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs. The damages will be much bigger if the tit-for-tat tariffs sparked by the Section 301 case take effect. China has long called for negotiations to resolve bilateral trade and investment issues. So if the Trump administration is open to negotiation as they indicated, they should immediately stop the tariff stick and start negotiations with China. Negotiations, whether through the China-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade or other platforms, will be a much better way to address each other’s concerns than threatening a tit-for-tat tariff war. Yes, negotiations may not be a smooth process and will not solve all the problems or solve them in a short period of time. That is just the nature of many complicated issues in big countries like China and the US. The gun violence, for example, has haunted Americans for decades, but it remains a serious issue regardless of massive public demonstrations like the recent “March for Our Lives”. China has long called on the US to loosen and lift its restrictions on US high-tech exports to China. The US has not only failed to address this effectively, but rather moved in the opposite direction with more discriminative policies against China, both in trade and investment. And it’s impossible for the US to demand that China, the largest developing country, solve its problems overnight even if this is in China’s best interest. What is important is that China is moving in the right direction. It has been steadily improving its protection of intellectual property rights, a key element for China to move into an innovation-driven society. Chinese leaders have pledged further reform and opening-up. President Xi Jinping is expected to roll out new reform and opening-up measures at the Boao Forum for Asia to be held in Hainan Island April 8-11. After all, this year marks the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up drive, which has brought phenomenal progress to China and also benefited the whole world, including the US. It’s in China’s own interest to continue to reform and open up. So it’s really time for Trump to give up the useless tariff weapon and come to the negotiation table.

US bid to foil Chinese tech sector's rise bound to fail,3/30/2018,"                          China tech makes a show at SXSW 2018 in Austin, Texas. [Photo/MAY ZHOU / CHINA DAILY]   Recent moves by the Trump administration aimed at foiling China's development of its high-tech industries are nothing but a containment strategy that is doomed to failure.  US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade advisor Peter Navarro both fear-mongered lately about the Made in China 2025 strategy, which aims to upgrade the country's manufacturing sector by focusing on 10 sectors-information technology, high-end machinery and robotics, aerospace, marine equipment and ships, advanced rail transport, new energy vehicles, electric power, agriculture machinery, new materials and biomedical.  While Lighthizer described the Chinese strategy as a threat to the global trading system and vowed that the US will draft its punitive tariff list, based on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, targeting Chinese products under the strategy, Navarro distorted the Chinese plan as an attempt ""to dominate every single emerging industry of the future, and therefore your economies aren't going to have a future"".  This is in stark contrast to what Premier Li Keqiang said at the China Development Forum on Monday that the Made in China 2025 strategy promotes an open and fair environment with equal treatment for domestic and overseas businesses.  China will not force any technology transfer from any foreign company and will enhance efforts to protect intellectual property rights and severely crack down on infringement, and it welcomes more globally competitive businesses to share China's growth opportunities, Li said.  The US has taken actions to tighten restrictions on high-tech exports to China, and Chinese investment in the US tech sector. The decision last week by Best Buy to stop selling smartphones and laptops by Huawei is the latest example of pressures on US businesses by their government and Congress, following similar declarations by AT&T and Verizon in January.  The US is exceptional in this regard. Huawei has been quite successful in other countries. It just launched its cutting-edge P20 and P20 Pro smartphones in Paris this week. In Africa and Latin America, Huawei and ZTE, the two largest Chinese telecom product manufacturers, have helped many nations modernize their telecom systems.  The ulterior motive of such US actions is reflected in its recent National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy which repeatedly mentioned China and labeled it as strategic competitor and revisionist power that threatens the US.  The underlined message is clear: The US should do whatever it takes to prevent China from surpassing the US, whether economically, militarily or technologically.  In the early 1990s, the US exhibited similar paranoia against an economically fast rising Japan, despite the fact that Japan has been its security ally. There was much talk in the US 25 years ago about Japanese conspiracy to overtake the US or the US being at economic war with Japan.  It is true that the US containment strategy today does not look exactly like the Cold War when the US and the Soviet Union had little economic interdependence. But in trying to hurt China today, the US will also hurt itself.  However, one thing is clear, the US bid to halt China in advancing its technology sector will not succeed. Despite the US' draconian restrictions on exporting high-tech products to China, China continues to advance.  On the contrary, the US efforts will only make China more determined in pursuing its modernization strategy. And the US may very well miss the great opportunities of the vast Chinese market, not to mention that the Chinese have a long memory about the countries that have inflicted harm on their nation.

Trump trying to fool US public with tariff claims,3/23/2018,"                      Anyone who believes that there is unanimous support in the United States for the Trump administration's proposed Section 301 tariffs on China should refer to the House of Representatives hearing on Wednesday when US Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer was grilled.  Lawmakers, many from states which elected Donald Trump as president, expressed the deep anxiety of their constituents about the possible repercussions of tit-for-tat retaliation or even a trade war being triggered by the proposed tariffs on China, which could reportedly be up to $60 billion a year. The biggest concern is the effect they would have on US industries and local economies, and what that would mean for workers, farmers and consumers, especially low-income families.  Major US retailers, from Walmart to Target, voiced similar concerns in their letter to Trump last week, saying the Section 301 action would worsen the inequality in the US and punish working families with higher prices on household basics.  There is no doubt that the Section 301 action and the other US tariffs announced recently will hurt the Americans Trump has pledged to put first.  For example, the tariffs imposed on imported washing machines announced in January will end up as a tax on 97 million US households in the name of protecting 2,400 workers in washing machine factories. And the tariffs on imported solar modules and cells threaten 258,000 workers in the installation sector in the name of saving 2,000 workers in the manufacturing sector, according to the Cato Institute.  Trump's Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could result in a net loss of 146,000 US jobs, even without taking into consideration possible retaliation from US trading partners, according to Washington-based consulting group Trade Partnership.  A major disruption in China-US trade would be disastrous for the US. China-US trade supports 2.6 million US jobs, including jobs that Chinese companies have created in the US, according to a 2017 Oxford Economics report.  The report shows that besides supporting US jobs, Chinese manufacturers lowered prices for US consumers, dampened inflation and put more money in their wallets, since for a typical US household earning $56,500 in 2015, trade with China saved these families up to $850 that year.  In 2007, Sara Bongiorni's book, A Year without Made in China: One Family's True Life Adventure in the Global Economy, describing her family's attempt to boycott Chinese made products attracted much attention. While the story might have changed today, because a lot of labor intensive jobs have been relocated from China to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh over the past decade with rising labor costs in China, still US consumers shopping in stores such as Walmart and Target would be hurt if China and other developing countries no longer supplied cheap products due to the tariffs.  ""The Economic Benefits of US Trade"", a 2015 report by the Council of Economic Advisers, shows that compared to a world with no trade, median-income consumers in the US gain an estimated 29 percent of their purchasing power from trade.  But Trump does not want American people to know this. Instead, he has constantly painted US as a victim in global trade. He has never talked about how most manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation, rather than trade, and he has never talked about how the US government has done a poor job of helping workers negatively impacted by trade deals.  Trump has also misled the US people by equating US trade deficits to a loss for the US and a win for its trade partners, despite the fact that almost all economists disagree with such a notion.  It's time to stop Trump and other folk fooling the American people.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US witch hunt against China harks back,3/16/2018,"                          File photo of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. [Photo/Agencies]   After some US politicians and news outlets tried to denigrate normal US-China cultural and academic exchanges, a China specialist, speaking at a recent talk in Washington, warned about an undertone of McCarthyism.  McCarthyism in the early 1950s was a dark period in US history when US Senator Joseph McCarthy led a massive scare campaign aimed at purging alleged communists in the US government and institutions.  When it was suggested that McCarthyism was too strong a word, the China specialist said it might be better to say witch hunt. But to me, McCarthyism was a witch hunt, only in an extreme way.  The China bashing and fear-mongering in the United States are nothing new, with politicians often indulging in them. I am not referring to the constructive criticism about China, which should be warmly welcomed, but the witch hunting based on utter ignorance, prejudice or malice.  The recent attacks in the US on the Confucius Institute, the China-United States Exchange Foundation headed by former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, the Chinese news media operating in the US, Chinese students and scholars studying and teaching in US colleges and universities and Chinese foreign direct investment are examples of this witch hunt.  FBI Director Chris Wray made a shocking comment at the Feb 13 Senate hearing when he said the US should view ""the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat"" and ""it's going to take a whole-of-society response by us"". He listed Chinese professors, scientists, students in the US among the threats.  Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, was equally guilty when he asked the question about ""the counterintelligence risk posed to US national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics"".  No wonder many Asian-American organizations such as The Committee of 100 immediately condemned such racially charged rhetoric.  It is the rhetoric of hate speech. Which is how I condemned the 2012 documentary Death by China based on the book by Peter Navarro and Greg Autry.  The same would apply to Rex Tillerson, the just-sacked US secretary of state, when he tried to incite hatred of China by deliberately distorting the Chinese activities in Africa and Latin America during his recent trips there.  The remarks of US politicians, news media and even pundits when talking about China have become increasingly disturbing; to many of them, it seems to be simply their default mode to vilify China.  Some US lawmakers, pundits and journalists I chatted with recently have denied the existence of such a bias against China. Yet I am not convinced.  In her latest book Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations, Amy Chua, a professor at Yale Law School better known for her parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, talks about how Americans indulge in great ideological battles and how identity politics have seized both the American left and right in a dangerous and racially inflected way, preventing them from correctly understanding and dealing with foreign countries.  Whether it's called McCarthyism or a witch hunt, the trend currently developing in the US should serve as a wake-up call not to repeat a dark period of US history.

Using Africa as a ploy to attack China futile,3/10/2018,"                      File photo of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. [Photo/Agencies]   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's 27-minute speech at George Mason University, Virginia, on Tuesday before he embarked on a five-nation tour of Africa would have been fine had he cut it a bit short. Instead, he chose to accuse China of encouraging dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices and corrupt deals to mire African countries in debt, undercut their sovereignty, deny them their long-term and self-sustaining growth.  Tillerson had also accused China of being a colonial power before his visit to Latin America a month ago only to be countered by Peruvian Trade and Tourism Minister Eduardo Ferreyros, who praised China as a good trade partner.  The same is true in Africa. After Tillerson landed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on Wednesday on the first leg of his Africa trip, he must have been surprised to see a sparkling light rail built by China Railway Group that has been operating since 2015, the year I visited and covered the African countries with huge economic potential. He should also have been struck by a 759-kilometer modern railway linking Addis Ababa with neighboring Djibouti, which started commercial operations on Jan 1 this year. More than 95 percent of the trade of landlocked Ethiopia passes through Djibouti.  When Tillerson said the United States sees a bright future in Africa, I thought he meant China, not only because I wrote that China views Africa with optimism, but also because BBC reported on Tuesday that Chinese construction companies have made significant improvements to long-neglected infrastructure in a number of countries.  China believes Ethiopia and many other African countries have the potential to repeat China's economic miracle while avoiding the mistakes it has committed in the past four decades.  One wonders whether Tillerson toured the Eastern Industrial Zone in Dukem just outside Addis Ababa, for there he would have seen how Chinese companies are contributing to industrial modernization, training workers and creating tens of thousands of jobs, invalidating all his accusations against China.  David Dollar, a US Treasury emissary in Beijing during the Barack Obama administration and a former World Bank country director for China, has done extensive research on China in both Africa and Latin America. Asked about the accusations labeled against China by Tillerson recently and Hillary Clinton a few years ago, Dollar denounced them as ""nonsense"", saying it is hard to back them up with evidence and they were humiliating to African and Latin American countries.  Douglas Paal, director of the Asia program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has just returned from a fact-finding trip to Africa. In a talk at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, he praised China's economic activities on the continent, saying the African countries welcomed them. Paal, a China expert who served in the George H.W. Bush administration, termed Tillerson's speech on Tuesday as ""terrible"", ""an impoverished speech conceptually and counterproductive tactically"" that sets the ""American policy in the wrong direction"".  Tillerson's speech may have been aimed at distracting African countries from the offensive comment of US President Donald Trump against them in January, or Tillerson's deeds as chief executive of Exxon Mobil to push for deals in African countries that were widely denounced for being mired in corruption and ignoring human rights. African oil exports account for some 90 percent of US-Africa trade.  Whatever the motive, Tillerson's ploy is unlikely to succeed because of China's cooperative and positive activities in Africa. Of course, Africa would benefit much more if the US, instead of criticizing China, joined hands with China to tap the huge growth potential of the continent.

Trump's mixed messages on peninsula issue are dangerous,3/2/2018,"                            US President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the East Room of the White House in Washington, US, Feb 23, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]     By continuing to test nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles in 2017, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea raised tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. But equally disturbing have been the contradictory messages from the Donald Trump administration, such as a ""preventive war"", ""bloody nose"" and, especially, last week's unspecified ""phase two"" concept.  Such belligerent rhetoric is especially troubling now, because the just-concluded Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games brought about rapprochement between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea. The DPRK sent high-profile officials and a nearly 500-strong delegation to the Winter Olympics, and its leader Kim Jong-un invited ROK President Moon Jae-in to visit the DPRK. More importantly, the DPRK also stated its willingness to hold talks with the United States.  Pyongyang has also offered to send a 20-member delegation next Wednesday to the March 9-18 Pyeongchang Winter Paralympics. It's true that the current reconciliation does not necessarily mean Pyongyang will abandon its missile and nuclear programs, but it seems this is a good time for all parties involved to pursue dialogue to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration's messages to both Pyongyang and Seoul have been confusing, to say the least.  In fact, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may feel baffled himself. Back in December, when Tillerson said the US was willing to start diplomatic talks with the DPRK without any preconditions, he was quickly overruled by Trump. And in October, when Tillerson said in Beijing that Washington was in direct communication with Pyongyang to pursue diplomatic talks, Trump tweeted that Tillerson was ""wasting his time"" in trying to negotiate with the DPRK.  On Monday, Trump told US governors that the US is willing to talk only under the right conditions, that is, after the DPRK gives up its nuclear and missile programs. But on Feb 23, right after the US Treasury Department announced new unilateral sanctions on the DPRK, Trump told a news conference, where Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, too, was present, that ""if the sanctions don't work, we'll have to go to phase two. Phase two may be a very rough thing, may be very, very unfortunate for the world"".  Although Trump did not specify what phase two means, many see it as a signal for preemptive military strike, which has been opposed by all countries, including US allies Japan and the ROK.  The DPRK's security concerns, it seems, are justified, as the US has pursued regime change in countries such as Iraq, which did not have any nuclear weapons, and Libya, which had abandoned its nuclear program years ago.  Back in August, Trump tweeted that Pyongyang will be ""met with fire, fury...the likes of which this world has never seen before"". And at the UN in September, the US president said he might be forced to ""totally destroy"" the DPRK. These were in addition to the constant US rhetoric that all options were on the table, a code for war. As such, Trump's war rhetoric shows that the DPRK's worry is valid.  The US is known to resort to military means to resolve issues, and the Trump administration seems to be following the same policy, as it seeks a hike in its 2019 defense budget and sharply reduce its funding for the State Department and US Agency for International Development, a sign of increased militarization of the US foreign policy.  But an all-out military conflict on the Korean Peninsula will result in the loss of countless lives and will be devastating for the region and the world. So no one, not even the US, should float such an irresponsible idea.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
Trump's fixation on deficit shows he needs an economics primer,2/23/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump delivers a speech on tax reform after touring Sheffer Corporation in Blue Ash outside Cincinnati, Ohio February 5, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   Donald Trump has been consistent in blaming the United States' economic woes on its trade partners, having done so even before he started campaigning to be president in 2016. However, his rationale is totally flawed.  The many economists I have talked to cannot understand why the Trump administration is so infatuated with the country's trade deficit.  When reports indicated that the US' trade deficit grew 12 percent in 2017 to $566 billion, economists were quick to point out that the Trump administration's tax reduction this year will help widen the US trade deficit by stimulating imports. Trump should raise taxes if he really wants to shrink the trade deficit.  The US has itself to blame because its trade deficit has everything to do with US fiscal policy, the low US saving rate and the role of the US dollar as a global currency.  In the past months, the Trump administration has been imposing punitive tariffs on a wide range of goods, everything from solar panels, washing machines to steel and aluminum products. The rationale is to safeguard US domestic industries from injuries caused by foreign imports. But if the US does not buy from China, the Republic of Korea or Mexico, for example, it will only buy from elsewhere, at higher prices.  A week ago, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross released reports on the department's investigation into the impact on US national security from steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the 1962 US Trade Expansion Act. It is still not clear what actions Trump might take based on the reports. However, the tariff measures the Trump administration has introduced in the past months have already sparked protests and countermeasures from US trade partners, as well as strong backlash at home.  For example, the tariffs on solar cells and modules will effectively eliminate 23,000 jobs in US solar energy industry in 2018, much more than the few jobs it seeks to protect in several inefficient US firms. Several prominent US senators, such as John McCain, have criticized the tariffs on solar panels as a tax on US consumers.  This has not taken into account the huge damages it will cause the US and global renewable energy industry. Having withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accord, Trump probably does not care about this anyway.  The same backlash was triggered when Trump sat down on Feb 13 with US lawmakers to discuss the Section 232 case against steel and aluminum imports.  The Congressmen who expressed the deepest concern were mostly Republican. They believe that the tariffs will invite retaliation from other countries and also hurt US manufacturers, both downstream and upstream, by raising the prices of intermediary materials. The lawmakers also believe that the tariffs are likely to produce net job losses in the US.  After all, only 16 percent of US domestic consumption of steel was imported in 2016, and China, the favorite bogeyman for US politicians, accounted for only 2 percent of the 16 percent.  With only 3 percent of what the US produces domestically needed for national security reasons, it is hard for the US to make a case based on national security grounds.  In the solar panel tariff case, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, the ROK and European Union have already taken the US to the World Trade Organization.  Clearly someone has to enlighten Trump on why his fixation with the trade deficit and tariffs is not helping the US while hurting the US' trading partners.

US' strategies poison the well for cooperation with China,2/9/2018,"                      The National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Nuclear Posture Review unveiled by the United States over the past two months have poisoned the well of the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world. In them, China is called a challenge to US power, influence and interests, and accused of attempting to erode US security and prosperity. The Pentagon claims that long-term strategic competition with China and Russia are now its principal priorities. The past two months have seen a torrent of anti-China rhetoric. Many US politicians, pundits and even news outlets have also jumped on the bandwagon in spreading their China threat theory. For instance, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Latin America of the imperial power of China on his trip to the region this week. On the economic and trade front, the US has adopted discriminative measures against China largely because China is not a US ally. Such a hostile climate created by the Trump administration is hardly conducive to cooperation between the two countries on important bilateral, regional and global issues. And there are many issues they should be cooperating on, from fighting terrorism and promoting global growth to mitigating climate change and working to prevent nuclear non-proliferation, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that is such a priority for both nations and the world today. By using the rhetoric in its national strategies, the Trump administration has weakened the already fragile mutual trust between the two large nations.The word ""American imperialism"" was used frequently in China only four decades ago. Since then, China has not used such defamatory words against the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi did not point fingers at the US during his recent visit to Latin America. But facts speak louder than words. Tillerson was unsuccessful in defaming China. After his meeting with Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's Trade Minister Eduardo Ferreyros said China is a good trade partner.On the other hand, Tillerson's defense of the Monroe Doctrine reflects the deep-rooted thinking of an imperial power. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray dismissed Tillerson's suggestion that Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro could be toppled by his own military. It is true that the China-US relationship is characterized by both competition and cooperation. But while engaging in competition, the two countries should not let it spiral into conflict or confrontation, which would undermine the huge potential of cooperation. There was deep concern about the bilateral relations before Donald Trump's inauguration as US president last year. Most of the concern was based on Trump's tough anti-China rhetoric during his presidential campaign and his phone conversation with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. Fortunately, that concern dissipated greatly with the many subsequent close and positive interactions between Trump and President Xi Jinping. Trump's tweets in 2017 included many positive messages about China and Xi. The phone calls between the two leaders, and their meetings in the Mar-a-Lago resort in April, Hamburg in July and Beijing in November have all given bilateral relations an injection of positive momentum. Their launch of the four high-level dialogue mechanisms has also shown the willingness of both sides to continue to expand their cooperation and manage differences. China and the US have become much closer and similar today compared with 1972 when US president Richard Nixon made his icebreaking trip to China. However, the two countries will not be exactly the same largely due to their different histories, cultures, traditions and political systems. It means that creating a good working relationship is extremely important for the two large nations and the world. The antagonistic rhetoric against China in the US' national strategies is simply counterproductive in this regard. The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
"Which country is the real threat to world stability, it's not China",2/2/2018,"                          China has seen an increase in people's trust in institutions running the country while the US has recorded a massive collapse. [Photo/IC]   The State of the Union address delivered by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday and the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy unveiled by his administration in the past month have all painted China as a rival or threat.  But few have bothered to reverse the question and ask, ""Is the United States a threat to China?""  The answer to that is a resounding ""Yes!""  When I raised such a question last week at a discussion on ChinaFile, an online publication run by the New York-based Asia Society, I did not expect Rebecca Karl, a historian and China scholar, to respond by saying the US has not only been a threat to China, but also the whole world, for decades.  It is true that China is a threat to the US, but only in the sense that fast-rising China has made it increasingly impossible for the US to threaten China, whether economically, militarily, or diplomatically. And that will be more so in the coming decades if China continues its ascent.  That is indeed a challenge and threat to the US which has become accustomed to living in and policing its unipolar world.  The kinds of threats posed by China to the US as described by US politicians, pundits and news media are many and often paranoid. They cover everything from China's growing economic and military might to the development of manmade islands in the South China Sea, from Chinese investment in Africa, Latin America and the US, to the Confucius Institutes, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Belt and Road Initiative, and even Chinese news media operating in the US and globally and the 300,000 Chinese students studying in US colleges and universities.  Sooner or later, Chinese restaurants, estimated at more than 40,000 across the US, might be deemed a national security threat because their dishes are too oily and might contain monosodium glutamate as a flavor enhancer.  But if China does pose a threat to the US in these areas, then the US poses a much greater threat to China. It's not just that American fast food chains serve far more oily food and Americans' favorite snack-chips-contains too much MSG, the more than 800 US military bases in the world, including many surrounding China, pose a much greater threat to China and other countries. US military spending is more than that of the next 10 countries combined and still expanding.  The powerful US military-industrial complex, whose influence former US president Dwight Eisenhower warned against in his farewell speech in January 1961, has been behind this hyping up of supposed threats from China and Russia, because the defense companies will be the primary beneficiary if Trump's request for $716 billion for the Pentagon in 2019 is approved. This is a significant increase on previous years.  People should be reminded that China has never done anything nearly as threatening to world peace and stability as the US invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan and forcing regime change in Libya, not to mention the reckless US drone attacks in sovereign nations that have killed many civilians. And China has never been nearly as disruptive as the US has been in just this past year when Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord and from UNESCO, cut funding to the United Nations and recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.  It's quite clear which country poses the bigger threat to the world and is a bigger disrupter of global stability.

How divisive will Trump be when he speaks in Davos?,1/26/2018,"                          Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum, attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 23, 2018. [Photo/Agencies]   The news that US President Donald Trump will attend the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos and deliver a keynote speech there on Friday has shocked many and even sparked protests in several Swiss cities.  Trump's populist and nationalist rhetoric during his presidential campaign and in his first year in office is widely viewed as being the antithesis to the overwhelmingly globalist views at Davos. It's like having him speak at a Democratic National Convention.  White House officials explained on Tuesday that Trump's ""America First"" policy is not ""America Alone"" and he wants to tell the world that the United States is open for business and wants the world to invest in the US.  But facts are more eloquent than words. In the past year, Trump has announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. He has also cut funding to the United Nations and threatened to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The US president also defied the strong global opposition to recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Even on the key issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which Trump intends to talk about at Davos, he has repeatedly contradicted himself and members of his administration. In his first speech at the UN in September, Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, triggering an outcry against such a genocidal comment.  While on the trade front, Trump has pulled out the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement if the other parties involved-Canada and Mexico and the Republic of Korea-do not make unilateral concessions.  Just a day before he departed for Davos, Trump signed two orders imposing steep tariffs on imported solar cells and washing machines. The protectionist measures have dealt a heavy blow to the US and global renewable energy industry and drawn protests from both inside and outside the US.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have blasted Trump's protectionism and isolationism in their speeches at Davos in the past two days, although they did not mention the US president by name.  Richard Hass, president of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, described Trump as turning the US from a preserver to a disruptor of the international order in his first year in office.  The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer released this week showed that trust in the US has suffered the largest-ever recorded drop and ranks the lowest among the 28 nations surveyed. And a Gallup poll released last week that the median approval of US leadership in more than 130 countries and regions was at a mere 30 percent.  In both surveys, China fared better than the US, a rebuke to some Americans who still try to defame China as a disruptor of the global order.  Indeed, the speech by President Xi Jinping at Davos in January 2017 was one of the most frequently quoted in the past year, often as a contrast to Trump's isolationist, protectionist and anti-globalization statements and deeds.Xi was the star at the 2017 WEF when the world was haunted by the anti-globalization sentiment, in particular Brexit-Britain's departure from the European Union-and Trump's ""America First"" policy. The fact that Xi's words are still being cited at this year's Davos shows people's deep concerns over Trump's policies.  I hope Trump proves me wrong when he speaks on Friday in front of the world and business leaders who are clearly at odds with his policy.

Washington suffers from serious form of paranoia,1/19/2018,"                          Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, and his now-ex-wife Wendi Deng attends the premiere for ""The Tree of Life"" at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France, May 16, 2011.[Photo/icpress.cn]   The United States might be the most powerful country in the world. But its capital Washington is undoubtedly the most paranoid place on the planet as exhibited this past Tuesday.  In a front-page report, The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed sources close to the US intelligence community as saying that Wendi Deng, former wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is lobbying for a high-profile construction project funded by the Chinese government in Washington. The report also said the planned $100 million ""Chinese Garden"" at the US National Arboretum was deemed a national security risk because it included a 70-foot-high tower that could potentially be used for surveillance.  With due respect for the newspaper, the reporters clearly did not press their sources hard enough to get the facts, given the gravity of the allegation.  Anyone who has visited the arboretum knows that a six-story-high building in the 400-acre (161.87-hectare) arboretum may be good for bird watching as it would offer a 360-degree eyeful of lushness-trees, shrubs, bushes and grass-but an ill-advised spot for surveillance as it would be far from anywhere.  The arboretum is 3 miles (4.82 kilometers) from Capitol Hill and 4 miles from the White House. My office at the National Press Building is probably a better spot for surveillance, as it is only a block from the US Treasury Department and two blocks from the White House.  The China Garden project dates back to 2003, and the US Congress approved its construction in 2008. The long-delayed project had been on the factsheet of the annual US-China Consultation on People-to-People Exchange for many years.  I covered the groundbreaking ceremony for the project in October 2016, which was attended by senior US Agriculture Department and State Department officials, including then undersecretary of state Catherine Novelli and principal deputy assistant secretary of state Susan Thornton, who is now the acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  Exactly how this might turn out to be a Chinese spy project, according to the WSJ, is beyond anybody's wildest imagination. No wonder a Chinese embassy representative said the report was ""full of groundless speculations"".  If the Chinese government were to use the WSJ logic, it would not allow any US citizen to have a building or live within 3 to 4 miles of Zhongnanhai or the Great Hall of the People because they could pose a national security threat.I am glad Beijing is not even half as paranoid as Washington.  Also on Tuesday, Reuters reported that US lawmakers had urged AT&T to cut all commercial ties with Huawei Technologies and reject China Mobile's plans to enter the US market. The lawmakers also threatened US companies that having ties with the two Chinese firms could hamper their ability to do business with the US government. The news came a week after AT&T dropped its plan to sell Huawei's latest smartphone, the Mate 10, also under the pressure of US lawmakers.  Of late, the lawmakers have also introduced bills aimed at banning business with Huawei and ZTE, and more strictly scrutinizing Chinese companies investing in the US. The paranoia is so severe that many US experts, such as Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Dan Ikenson of Cato Institute are alarmed.  Some Chinese want their government to return the favor by targeting Apple and other US companies that have access to Chinese citizens' data. There is little doubt that the powerful US intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, are exploiting all means possible in China, including through US companies.  Yet I am glad the Chinese government has not shown the same paranoia as the US lawmakers and the WSJ.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US lawmakers make fool of themselves with Taiwan bills,1/12/2018,"                                             On Tuesday, the House of Representatives in the United States passed two bills relating to Taiwan through voice vote. The Taiwan Travel Act (H.R.535) aims to encourage diplomatic visits between US and Taiwan officials at all levels, while bill H.R. 3320 directs the US secretary of state to develop a strategy to restore observer status for Taiwan in the Geneva-based World Health Organization. The bills won't become law until they pass the US Senate and are then signed by US President Donald Trump. The fact that only a handful of Congressmen were present in the largely empty hall when the two bills were discussed and voted showed that most US lawmakers didn't take them seriously. The Taiwan Travel Act, sponsored in January 2017 by Steve Chabot, a Republican representative from Ohio, is a flagrant violation of the one-China principle observed since the People's Republic of China and the United States established their diplomatic ties in 1979. In the 1979 China-US joint communiqué on the establishing diplomatic ties, Washington recognized the PRC government as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The communiqué also stipulates that the US can only maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. So it's absurd for US lawmakers, such as Brad Sherman, a Democratic congressman from California, to describe Taiwan on Tuesday as a ""country"" and ""nation"". The Chinese government's stance has been firm and crystal clear. When the bill passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee last October, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that the bill could ""harm China-US relations"" and encourage ""Taiwan independence"". She urged the US to handle the Taiwan question with caution, abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués, refrain from conducting any kind of government-level exchanges with Taiwan, and not to send wrong signals to Taiwan ""separatists"". Bill H.R. 3320, sponsored last July by Ted Yoho, a Republican Congressman from Florida, is equally absurd, blaming Beijing for the loss of observer status at the WHO last year. China's central government made a special arrangement for Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly from 2009 to 2016 as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" in accordance with the 1992 Consensus reached between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. However, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic Progressive Party, who took office on May 20, 2016, has refused to endorse the 1992 Consensus and recognize that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one China, a prerequisite for Taiwan's participation at the assembly. So if those US lawmakers try to help the situation rather than confuse the public, they should urge Tsai to endorse the one-China principle as soon as possible. Cross-Straits relations developed by leaps and bounds in the eight years that Ma Ying-jeou was Taiwan leader from 2008 to 2016, delivering concrete benefits to people on both sides of the Straits. The Chinese mainland is by far Taiwan's largest trade partner, absorbing nearly 30 percent of Taiwan's exports. The closer economic and people-to-people exchanges brought unprecedented peace and stability to the Taiwan Straits, until jeopardized by Tsai's refusal to endorse the 1992 Consensus. Those US lawmakers who support the bills should first educate themselves instead of becoming a laughing stock. They should also realize that the days that they can willfully interfere in China's internal affairs are long gone. No US politicians should be allowed to flirt with the China-US relationship, the most consequential relationship in the 21st century. The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
US moves threaten to foil Sino-US trade ties,1/5/2018,"                      President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump speak to reporters at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday. XU JINGXING / CHINA DAILY   There were a lot of uncertainties a year ago over China-US trade and investment ties given what Donald Trump had said during his presidential campaign, in particular his claim that he would impose 45 percent punitive tariffs on imports from China and name China a currency manipulator.  Neither of these has happened so far. Indeed, President Trump handled the relationship quite well in 2017.  One highlight was the good personal relationship built between Trump and President Xi Jinping, after their in-depth meetings in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April, in Beijing in November and during the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July and several telephone conversations.  The two countries have become more interdependent and are now each other's largest trade partner. China is already the largest market for US agricultural products. The lifting of a 13-year ban on US beef exports to China has excited many ranchers in the United States. More than 300,000 Chinese students are studying in US colleges and universities and 3 million Chinese tourists visited the US in 2016.  In November, China announced it will further open its financial sector, by allowing foreign investors to own majority stakes in securities firms, investment management companies and life insurance providers. In the same month, China announced it will cut import tariffs of a wide range of consumer goods.  With 300 million middle-income consumers, and the number still growing, the potential for expanding trade and investment ties between China and the US, and indeed between China and the rest of the world, is enormous.  Recent moves taken by the Trump administration, however, have cast a shadow on the relationship.  On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States rejected a $1.2 billion deal by China's Ant Financial to acquire US money transfer company Money-Gram International Inc on the grounds of national security. It is just the latest of several large deals that have been blocked by CFIUS.  Meanwhile, the US Congress has introduced the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017 in a bid to expand the power of CFIUS, targeting primarily investment from China.  In August, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer initiated a Section 301 investigation into China's intellectual property policy and practice, a move inconsistent with the World Trade Organization's rules. In November, the US Commerce Department self-initiated anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese common alloy aluminum sheets. In the same month, the US formally notified the WTO that it opposes granting market economy status to China.  There has also been much talk lately that the Trump administration will take more tough measures on the China trade and investment front in 2018. This sounds likely given that 2018 is the midterm election year and everything in the US will again be deeply politicized.  China has been relatively patient so far. But if the US continues down the current path, it will trigger tit-for-tat retaliations that would hurt people and businesses not only in both countries, but aslo the entire world. Many economists have warned that a US trade war with China is a trade war with East Asia given the economic integration in the region.  Some US journalists have accused President Trump of making China great. It seems that to them making China great is bad for the US. The truth is that China and the US, given their interdependence, should both become great.  Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers described it well when he said that he could not foresee a future in which China does well and the US does not, or vice versa.  China and the US both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Some people in the US just need to change their zero-sum mentality.

US should look at itself before pointing fingers at other countries,12/29/2017,"                          Cai Meng / China Daily   I love the Chinese noodles at a place in Midtown Manhattan. But whenever I eat there, I try to eat them as quietly as possible because slurping is regarded as unacceptable in the United States.  In Chinese and Japanese culture, slurping is not only acceptable but regarded as a sign that the noodle or ramen is delicious. To me, biting mouthfuls of noodles, as people in the US do instead of slurping, is painful.  On the other hand, nose-blowing at the dinner table, viewed as bad manners in China, is common even in fine restaurants in the US. It's hard to understand why folks blow as hard as they can.  The comparison is reminiscent of the frequent finger-pointing at China by many in the US. China's behavior has often been described as ""disruptive,""""provocative,"" and a ""challenge to the status quo and global order"" while the US proclaims it is trying to keep peace and stability around the world.  China's launch of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was depicted by many in the US as a challenge to the existing global system, in particular the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, despite the fact that heads of the two banks, plus the International Monetary Fund, all welcomed the new addition due to the acute shortage of needed infrastructure financing in the region.  In October, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson rebuked China claiming it was subverting the global order, undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors and for being an irresponsible international actor. He charged that China's lending practices have saddled nations with ""enormous levels of debt"". US President Donald Trump, in his National Security Strategy speech on Dec 18, said Russia and China ""seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth"".Yet anyone following US behavior would find these labels fit the US.For example, the US' recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec 6 against the strong opposition of the world; its reduction of funding to the United Nations announced on Sunday by its ambassador to the organization Nikki Haley; its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord in June and from UNESCO in October.  If these are not disruptive behaviors that challenge the global order, then I don't know what are. If China had done any of these things, US officials, news media and some pundits would be having a field day orchestrating a new smear campaign against China.  But if these were US ""misdemeanors"", here are some ""felonies"": On April 7, the US launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles into the sovereign nation of Syria before any international investigation was conducted into the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.  And an on-the-ground investigation by The New York Times Magazine found that ""one out of every five"" airstrikes in Iraq conducted by US-led coalition resulted in civilian deaths, in contrast to the Pentagon narrative that only 89 of the coalition's more than 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq, or about one of every 157 strikes, killed any civilians.  Airwars, a London-based journalist-led transparency project that monitors and assesses civilian casualties from international strikes in Iraq, Syria and Libya, reported that airstrikes by the US-led coalition have killed at least 5,975 Iraqi civilians. That is a massacre. And that is just the airstrikes in that country.According to the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, in 2016 alone, the US dropped 12,192 bombs in Syria and 12,095 bombs in Iraq.  It's hard to imagine how words like ""disruptive"" and ""undermining sovereignty"" can apply to China when the US behaves like this.

US politicians use double standard to assess China's growing influence,12/22/2017,"                      For most of this year, many US politicians were busy with their witch-hunt against Russia. However, of late they have found a new target as they are afraid of the growing Chinese influence in the United States and the rest of the world. By singling out Moscow and Beijing as the prime threats to Washington, the US National Security Strategy that was released on Monday will trigger more such witch-hunts, which some China experts in the US worry would fan anti-Chinese sentiments or Sinophobia. US politicians have pointed fingers at the Confucius Institutes that teach Americans Chinese language, culture and history; Hong Kong-based China-United States Exchange Foundation that sponsors think tank events in the US; Chinese investment overseas meant for building infrastructure in Asia, Africa and Latin America; and even the 300,000-plus Chinese students in US colleges and universities, who not only help the US economy, but also offer valuable perspective about China to US students, especially those who don't get the chance to study abroad. If such paranoid argument were right, the 100,000 Strong Initiative, endorsed by former US president Barack Obama to train a new generation of US students how to fruitfully engage China, could be scrapped for fear that such students will be under the influence of China. Since seminars sponsored by the China-US Exchange Foundation in Washington outshone many US think tank events on China, often with no Chinese scholars on the panel, they should be expanded, rather than being curtailed, in order to facilitate the much-needed exchange and understanding between the two countries and their peoples. The US has never shied away from expanding its own influence. The new National Security Strategy of US President Donald Trump has a chapter on the US expanding its influence, but when it comes to countries such as China spreading their influence, the US calls it ""buying influence."" It's a common deceit used by US politicians who dub their own torture methods as ""enhanced interrogation"", killing of innocent civilians abroad as ""collateral damage"" and interfering in other countries' elections as ""promoting democracy"". When the US uses its leverage against other countries, it is called ""pressure"". When China does so, it is called ""coercion"" . The 800 US military bases overseas not only reflect how the US influences the world, but also how it dominates it. To be blunt, China deserves to spread its influence, just like any other country, as it is home to one-fifth of humanity, the world's second-largest economy, the largest trading country and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. China's growing influence fits well with the responsible stakeholder concept propounded in 2005 by then US deputy secretary of state Robert Zoellick. Would the world be better and safer if China had not become a major financier of the UN peacekeeping mission and sent the largest peacekeeping troops among the five permanent members of the Security Council? Would the world be better off if China's economy had stagnated and not contributed to a third of the global growth for many years? Would the world be more connected if China does nothing about building infrastructure in other countries, or had established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and launched the Belt and Road Initiative? As a developing country, China has a lot to learn about global governance, that's why the AIIB has more board members from European countries. US politicians should applaud the many positive roles played by China and its growing influence across the world, instead of nitpicking and launching a witch-hunt against it. In short, the world's only superpower needs to develop a healthy mindset so as to accept China's peaceful rise. The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
China no longer willing to be a dumping ground for US waste,12/15/2017,"                      There have been many stories in US news media lately about how China's ban on foreign waste has caused recycling chaos in their country.  A National Public Radio story last week described the impact on Portland, Oregon, quoting a spokesman for local Rogue Waste as saying that the company had no choice but to take all of its recyclable material to the local landfill.  Few Americans know that one of the largest US exports to China is recyclable solid waste, as Yukon Huang, author of the book Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom is Wrong, likes to remind people. He noted that many US Commerce Department officials had no idea that was the case.  Every day, some 3,700 shipping containers full of recyclables are trucked to US ports, loaded onto ships and sent to China. The items in those containers include plastics, metal, paper, cardboard, and textiles, which Chinese manufacturers use as raw materials, as Bloomberg News outlined in a report tracing the process.  The US exported some 37 million metric tons of scrap commodities valued at $16.5 billion to 155 countries last year. China accounted for almost one-third of that total, about $5.2 billion.  The State Council, China's Cabinet, however, announced on July 18 new regulations banning the import of foreign waste. On the same day, China notified the World Trade Organization that it will no longer accept imports of 24 types of solid waste.  The move will help reduce the health and environmental risks posed by the waste, and also free up more of China's large but somewhat chaotic recycling industry to tackle the rapid increase of solid waste produced by 1.3 billion Chinese themselves.  The US, China, Brazil, Japan and Germany are the leading generators of waste. The US produced about 228 million tons of waste in 2006, a figure that climbed to 254 million tons by 2013. China, which has a population four times the US', has caught up in recent years, producing 190 million tons of waste per year.  US news reports have all focused on the difficult situation facing the US recycling industry. Almost none has delved into how much US households have contributed to the severe pollution in China over the years by exporting such waste and how average Americans should change their lifestyle to produce less waste for the sake of the planet.  And Minister of Environmental Protection Li Ganjie vowed on Aug 22 to maintain high pressure on Chinese companies that process imported foreign waste so that they comply with the safety regulations, after about 60 percent of companies that process imported foreign waste were found in a recent probe to have violated relevant rules.  Relocation of pollution has long been a strategy by advanced countries to exploit the often lax environmental standards in developing countries. It is a blemish that few Western companies like people to know about while they brag about their so-called corporate social responsibility.  Tackling and recycling the mounting domestic solid waste in China will be an ever daunting task. But facing such a challenge reflects China's determination to embark on a more environmentally sustainable path, rather than pursuing economic growth at all costs.

Decision makes Middle East peace a more remote prospect,12/8/2017,"                      US President Donald Trump delivers a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem on May 23, 2017. In the final remarks that concluded his first visit to the region, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that peace between Israel and the Palestinians is ""possible"". [Photo/Xinhua]   By recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday and ordering preparations for moving the US embassy there, US President Donald Trump defied the will of the majority of countries, and not for the first time.On June 1, he declared that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement to which the US was one of the 195 signatories.In announcing his explosive decision on Wednesday, Trump claimed it to be in the best interests of the US and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. ""This is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement,"" he said.But nothing could be further from the truth. He has taken a giant step toward further destabilizing the volatile Middle East.Shortly after his speech, protests erupted in Gaza City, Istanbul and Amman. More protests are expected in the days ahead.The US likes to boast it has the most allies in the world, but Trump found none siding with him on this decision, not even close West European allies such as Britain, France and Germany, all of which warned him beforehand not to go ahead with it and slammed his decision afterwards.As UN Security Council Resolution 194 states ""the only way to peace is by establishing an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in peace next to Israel"".""I want to make it clear-there is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.It is reported that some key cabinet members, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, did not endorse Trump's decision, even though the State Department later said it will immediately begin the process to implement the decision by starting the preparations to move the US embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem. Prominent people such as former US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, now executive vice-president of the Brookings Institution, and The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, both Jews, criticized Trump's decision.Trump claimed that he has the public's support, but few people in the US have come out publicly in support of his decision. The 45th US president is said to be merely fulfilling his campaign promise to some American evangelical and Jewish groups.In doing so, Trump has made it clear that the US is not an honest broker in the peace process as it has long claimed and confirmed the widespread perception that it is biased toward Israel. No wonder that many Muslim and Arab leaders said on Wednesday that they will no longer accept US as the mediator for the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.With its clear bias and excessive meddling in the Middle East, the US has long suffered low favorability ratings in the Middle East. A Pew Center report in June this year showed that only 15 percent of people in Jordan and 18 percent in Turkey had at least a somewhat favorable view of the US in 2017.Past US presidents refrained from doing what Trump did on Wednesday despite a 1995 law requiring the reloation of the US embassy to Jerusalem, by taking advantage of it also allowing presidents to waive the requirement at six-month intervals to protect US national security interests.Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all signed the waivers. Trump, too, issued a waiver on June 1 and again on Thursday.His Wednesday announcement is not just a departure from long-term US foreign policy, but setting off a big bomb and making Middle East peace an even more remote prospect.The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Food trucks offer food for thought,12/1/2017,"                      In New York, including glitzy downtown and midtown Manhattan, thousands of food trucks sell delicacies from around the world, from jianbing (Chinese crepe), hot dog, falafel, tacos, sushi and waffles to steaks, burgers, juices and desserts. The tasty and affordable culinary delights they offer draw large crowds of people from the nearby high-rise office buildings. Besides sidewalks, food trucks in New York can also be found at concerts, and they are also hired for wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, anniversaries and reunions. Online maps tell people how to find different kinds of food trucks and carts nearby. And regular food-truck rallies are held in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. There are also annual awards for the best food truck and pushcart chefs. ""What's more appetizing than a Grammy, more mouth-watering than an Emmy? Yes, it's The Vendy-symbolic of culinary supremacy among New York's 10,000 sidewalk chefs,"" exclaimed the New York Daily News. Ji Chen ""Peter"" Wang, who originally came from Kaifeng in Central China's Henan province, was among the finalists for the 2017 New York City Vendy Awards announced in September. He serves up Chinese-style barbecue skewers on Main Street in downtown Flushing, Queens. The Great Food Truck Race, a reality TV and cooking series, has produced 51 episodes in eight seasons, showing the fantastic food truck and pushcart culture in the city. The Lonely Planet also has a section introducing food truck culture as a new way to bite into the Big Apple. And organized tours are provided for people to taste their way through the best food trucks in Downtown and Midtown Manhattan. Pushcart vending in New York dates to 1691, when the Dutch first settled in what was then New Amsterdam. In fact, the area near Hanover Square, not far from Wall Street, was one of those areas in the early days. Today, many food trucks and pushcarts can still be found there. Some Chinese friends wonder why New York, often regarded as the greatest city in the world, would tolerate food trucks and pushcarts everywhere in the city, including on the sidewalks of Times Square and Fifth Avenue. Some describe the scene as messy, and some complain about the heavy smoke. I have heard that complaint from some New Yorkers as well. But New York City has very strict regulations to ensure food safety and cleanliness. And overall, most New Yorkers I talked to believe those street vendors should stay rather than be kicked out. Chinese cities that regard getting rid of street vendors as a step toward modernity could learn much from the rich and vibrant food truck-and-pushcart scene in New York City. In my hometown city of Shanghai, for example, the number of street vendors has plunged over the past two decades, as the municipal government outlawed them from many streets. As a result, it's hard for locals to get their favorite breakfast-pie, fritters, soy milk, sticky rice rolls. Many Chinese cities have learned lessons the hard way. They tore down many old buildings in the past decades in a rush to build skyscrapers before realizing they were an invaluable part of the city's history. China boasts a civilization of 5,000 years. Its street vendors also boast a history much longer than New York City's. It would be nice to keep and revive that rich and vibrant culture.

"Foreign media outlets in US merit bouquets, not brickbats",11/24/2017,"                      The recent move in the United States against foreign media organizations that receive government funding has raised serious concerns about press freedom and political bias against certain countries. About two weeks ago, Russia's RT America was forced by the US Justice Department to register as a ""foreign agent"" under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, an outdated anti-Nazi propaganda law. Days later, Reston Translator, Sputnik Radio's partner in the US, also registered as a foreign agent, although it said the course was not taken on the Justice Department's instructions. In apparent retaliation, the Russian parliament, or Duma, passed a bill on Nov 15 requiring all mass-media outlets in Russia which get overseas funding to register as foreign agents. Back in the US, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, in its annual report to the Congress last week, recommended that FARA be strengthened to make mandatory the registration of all staff of Chinese State-run media outlets posted in the US, because ""Chinese intelligence gathering and information warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese-run media organizations and in light of the present uneven enforcement of the FARA"". China's Foreign Ministry denounced the commission's recommendation, with spokesman Geng Shuang saying: ""The content in the relevant report is sheer fiction, and the viewpoint of the report reflects their bias and stereotype against China."" News organizations receiving government funding is not unique to China or Russia. It is a common practice in other Asian and European countries, too. For example, the NHK World and France 24 are fully financed by the Japanese and French governments. The current row reminds me of a debate at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in early 2011 on whether news organizations should accept government funding. Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, two students and I debated as the team in favor of government funding. Bollinger, a noted First Amendment legal scholar, argued that US universities, which more or less receive government funds, are still able to maintain academic freedom. At the end of the debate, students at the school voted 28 to 17 in favor of government funding. And I remember saying that what matters is doing good journalism, rather than the source of funding. We have seen lousy journalism by privately funded media outlets and excellent journalism by media outlets that receive full or partial government funding. NPR and PBS, the two US stations that receive some government funds, are widely seen as doing good journalism. The truth is, international media outlets operating in the US, from RT, CGTN, TRT (Turkish Radio and Television Corp) to NHK World and France 24, are doing a far better job of informing Americans about the outside world than major US outlets such as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. The three US networks often cater to single news stories a day, focusing of late either on Russia and US President Donald Trump, or Russia and former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, or Roy Moore, or Robert Mueller. Such disservice to the American people should be the real concern. Indeed, Gallup polls in recent months have revealed such serious concerns among US citizens. A Sept 14 Gallup report showed Americans' trust in mass media has sunk to a new low, with only 32 percent saying they had a ""great deal"" or ""a fair amount"" of trust in mass media, down 8 percentage points from a year ago. And in an April 5 poll, 62 percent said the news media favor one political party over the other. So, for those US politicians and lawmakers who care about keeping US citizens well informed, they should stop demonizing international news outlets and, instead, start thanking them for bringing to Americans different perspectives.

Trump trip can pave the way for smooth ties ahead,11/10/2017,"                      US President Donald Trump clearly had a good time on Wednesday, the day he and his wife Melania Trump arrived in Beijing. In his tweets, he thanked China and its leaders for the ""beautiful welcome"" and ""unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City"".  The same day, Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang and US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross witnessed the signing of business deals worth $9 billion.  The day happened to be the one-year anniversary of Trump winning a surprise victory in the 2016 election.  It is understandable that some long-standing issues between the two countries, such as US concern for market access and intellectual property and Chinese concern for excessive scrutiny of Chinese investment in the US and restriction of high-tech exports to China, won't be resolved during this visit.  Just look at how difficult it is for the Trump administration, or any US administration, to push for major domestic policy changes, whether it's healthcare or tax reform.  In fact, two identical bills introduced on Wednesday in the US Senate and House of Representatives to beef up the scrutiny of foreign investment, especially from China, if passed, would worsen the concern on the Chinese side.  And China's reform and opening-up in the past four decades is a process of gradual evolution. Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping described it as ""crossing the river by feeling the stones"", meaning it is generally going forward but might move sideward or even backward sometimes.  Looking back at China's great transformation in the past decades, however, no one would deny it has made remarkable progress on all fronts-economic, social and even political.  If you can adjust like this and take a historical view, you are more likely to show patience and understanding. After all, China is a country with one-fifth of the world's population but whose per capita GDP is only one-seventh of that of the US. Things don't change overnight because its leaders snap their fingers.  Time seems a different concept in the two countries. China is known for its long-term planning, such as its five-year plans and even a plan into 2049, the centennial of the People's Republic. Americans tend to seek immediate results. A US president will usually talk about his vision for the next four years.  Mutual understanding is important because it would encourage the two sides to spend more time in expanding practical win-win cooperation rather than being overly obsessed with issues that won't be solved in a short period of time, or even a longer period of time.  This is not to say that they should overlook the issues. Instead, they should try to manage and mitigate the challenges and not allow them to hold back the overall relationship.  In marking his one-year anniversary, Trump has pleasantly surprised many who a year ago were deeply worried about a trade war between the two countries given his harsh campaign rhetoric. Today, few are worried about this anymore despite the fact that trade frictions might increase as the two largest economies become more interdependent.  Trump has also surprised many for his relatively good handling of the US-China relations, including forging a close working and personal relationship with President Xi Jinping.  The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as described by Xi as the Chinese Dream and the ""Make America Great Again"" policy as promised by Trump will only become more attainable if the two countries work closely to expand their cooperation, instead of indulging in any wasteful zero-sum game.

It's vital to find the root cause of terrorism in order to fight it,11/2/2017,"                              Police examine a rented truck used by a driver who fatally ran over eight people on a bicycle path on the West Side of Manhattan on Oct 31. [Photo/Agencies]      The attack in Lower Manhattan in New York City on Tuesday that killed eight people and injured at least 11 was a ruthless assault on innocent civilians and deserves the strongest condemnation. The suspect, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, driving a pickup truck mowed people down on a bike lane along the Hudson River.  Police said Saipov, who entered the United States legally from Uzbekistan in 2010, believes in the Islamic State group's ""ideology"", and on being questioned by the investigators, he showed no remorse for the brutal attack and, instead, was almost boastful about it.  Americans have shown their courage by not giving in to the attack. The Halloween parade in Manhattan on Tuesday night went on as scheduled, with a large crowd in attendance. And there is no sign yet that the Sunday New York City Marathon will be cancelled or postponed.  However, some talking heads on US news channels have been saying the US should increase the vetting process of immigrants, even shut the door on people from certain countries. Some have revived the Muslim-phobia since Saipov shouted an Arabic slogan, after fleeing his truck and before being shot by police.  It might be too early to talk about the root cause of such terror attacks since many Americans are still in trauma. But without finding the real cause, it would be impossible to come up with the right and effective policies.  Far too often, US politicians have chosen the easy answer: They hate our way of life, our freedom, democracy and success. And that has not helped solve the problem, as terrorism has become an even greater threat to the US and many other countries.  What is surprising is that no one seems to think US domestic and foreign policies might have contributed to the increase in such terrorist attacks. For example, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have caused countless civilian deaths and pushed the two countries into chaos. The rampant US drone strikes, from Pakistan and Libya to Yemen and Somalia, have resulted in many civilian casualties and have long been said to have helped terrorist groups such as the IS and al-Qaida to attract new recruits.  The torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq and the illegal detention of suspects at the at Guantanamo detention camp are examples of how the US disregards international laws despite constantly preaching to other countries to follow them.  For years, Pew Center surveys have shown low public favorability for the US in the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the anti-American sentiments in regions where the US has flexed its muscles. The favorability for the US is only 15 percent in Jordan, 18 percent in Turkey and 27 percent in Tunisia, according to a Pew survey released in August this year.  Besides, some US domestic policies might also have alienated the Muslim community. Certain actions and rhetoric, whether from the government or just a talking head on TV, have reinforced the idea that the US is at war with the Muslim world.  Sarah Lyons-Padilla of Stanford University and Michele Gelfand of the University of Maryland conducted a study two years ago and found that integration of Muslim immigrants, rather than isolating them, is critical to fighting homegrown radicalization. They said anti-immigrant discourse is likely to fuel support for extremism rather than reducing it.  China and the US have deepened their counter-terrorism cooperation in recent years, but Washington still uses double standard when it comes to defining terrorism in other countries, even though the victims of terrorist attacks are innocent civilians.  The Tuesday attack in Manhattan is a tragedy. But fighting terrorism requires domestic and foreign policies to be formulated on sound analysis, not rhetoric that is only politically correct.

Chinese trust government more than Americans do,10/27/2017,"                      A common misconception in the West is that the Chinese don't support their government and trust their leaders as much as people do in the so-called liberal democracies in the West. But findings can be surprising.  Back in the late 1990s, one of my American colleagues in Shanghai said that before he came to China, he thought the Chinese people were overwhelmingly against their government. However, after working in the country for a few years, he found that Chinese love their government just like Americans love their government.  Returning to the United States after a few years, he penned an article for a local paper in New York sharing his experience.  Various surveys have also shown that the Chinese support for their government and leaders is exceptionally high compared with the US and other Western countries.  In the trust barometer survey released in January of this year by Edelman Global Public Relations, the Chinese showed the highest trust (76 percent) in their government among people of 28 countries and regions.  This study contrasts sharply with several recent Gallup polls which showed dismal approval ratings by Americans for their government, president and Congress.  The Gallup poll released on Oct 20 found that approval for US President Donald Trump had slipped to 36.9 percent in his third quarter, compared with 38.8 percent in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, from Oct 5 to Oct 11, approval for the US Congress fell to its lowest level since July 2016, 13 percent. This was just a few percentage points higher than its historic low of 9 percent recorded in 2013.  Another Gallup poll released on Oct 19 showed that only 21 percent of Americans are satisfied with the direction in which the US is heading, the lowest in more than a year.  Americans continue to cite dissatisfaction with the government above all other issues as the US' top problem. Government-representing a wide array of complaints about the federal government-has been at or near the top of the list for the past nine years.  Another Gallup poll released in May showed that public trust in the government remains near historic lows. Only 20 percent of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right ""just about always"" (4 percent) or ""most of the time"" (16 percent). It contrasts with the readings in 1958 when about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing almost always or most of the time.  In sharp contrast, a 2013 survey of 39 advanced, emerging and developing countries conducted by the Pew Center revealed that Chinese expressed the highest satisfaction with their country's direction. The 85 percent satisfaction rate dwarfed the 57 percent in Germany, 33 percent in Japan, 24 percent in South Korea, and 31 percent in the US.  Pew surveys available since 2002 have constantly shown a huge lead in Chinese satisfaction in their country's direction over the satisfaction expressed by Americans.  Even on key concerns of pollution, corruption and inequality, Chinese have displayed optimism that the situation will improve with government efforts in those areas, a contrast to the often pessimistic views in the US regarding the key problems in the country.  It is true that China, as a developing country, still has a lot to improve and to learn from the rest of the world. The conventional wisdom in the West that the Chinese government does not respond to people's demands is also proved wrong in various surveys. That is actually a major factor why China has been relatively successful in the past decades.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
"It's robots, not Chinese that are stealing American jobs",10/13/2017,"                      During a recent visit to a Shanghai hospital, I was amazed to see a robot, instead of a human being, dispensing medicine.  And then dining last week in a Cantonese dim sum restaurant in Shanghai, I was instructed to place my order by scanning a bar code on a device at the table.  In each case, I wondered how many jobs had been lost due to these new technologies being introduced. But I have not heard any Chinese complaining that technology and automation are taking their jobs.  In contrast, a survey released on Oct 4 by the Pew Research Center found that Americans are more worried than enthusiastic about the coming developments in automation-from driverless vehicles to a world in which machines perform many of the jobs currently done by humans.  The survey indicates that many Americans anticipate significant effects from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetime.  Specifically, Americans are more than twice as likely to express worry (72 percent) than enthusiasm (33 percent) about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans, according to the survey.  They are around three times as likely to express worry (67 percent) than enthusiasm (22 percent) about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human-to-human interaction.  Also, 76 percent of Americans expect that economic inequality will become much worse if robots and computers are able to perform many of the jobs that are currently done by humans.  A similar share (75 percent) anticipates that the economy will not create many new, better-paying jobs for humans if this scenario becomes a reality. And 64 percent expect that people will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives if forced to compete with robots and computers for jobs.  Concern about the loss of jobs due to automation is not new. A study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University shows that 85 percent of the 5.6 million manufacturing jobs lost in the US between 2000 and 2010 are attributed to technological change, mostly automation.  This refutes the rhetoric of US President Donald Trump during his campaign that the US lost manufacturing jobs as a result of trade with China, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Japan and a host of other countries.  ""America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and 50,000 factories since China joined the WTO,"" Trump said.  While trade may contribute to some job loss, evidence has shown that it is not the major factor, when automation is factored in.  Yet we never hear this side of the story from US politicians, not from Trump or his 2016 contender Hillary Clinton.  What we hear instead is the Trump administration's executive order to ""Hire American and Buy American"" as if the basic economic theory of comparative advantage suddenly does not apply to the United States.  That is certainly not true. The US has imposed a much higher cost on its consumers in order to save a limited number of outdated steel jobs.  If the US is so hungry for Third World manufacturing jobs, I guess the Chinese, and probably the Mexicans too, are more than happy to move up the supply chain and adopt more automation while sending those low-tech jobs back to the US.  The question is: The US is no longer competitive in those industries, so are US consumers willing to pay a price several times higher?

Las Vegas carnage yet another wake-up call,10/4/2017,"                      The Sunday night massacre on the Las Vegas Strip which left at least 59 dead and more than 500 wounded has shocked the entire United States, triggering a new round of national debate on gun policy while people are mourning the victims.  The 64-year-old shooter, Stephen Paddock, was found to have dozens of weapons, including semiautomatic rifles, scopes and thousands of rounds of ammunition, at the hotel room where he committed the carnage and at his home in Mesquite, Nevada.  Yet this is just déjà vu all over again.  In my eight years in the US, I have seen the nation traumatized time and again by such mass shootings, from the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 that left 12 dead and 70 wounded to the shooting and killing that same year of 20 children and six adults in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, to June last year when a heavily-armed gunman opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49.  In each of the mass shootings, politicians, whether Republican or Democrat, all came out and angrily condemned the evil. But in the end, very little was changed in terms of gun policy, a reflection of a very polarizing issue in the US.  So, the question is not whether such a tragedy will happen again but rather when and where.  Gun violence has become such a serious problem in the US that the annual report on human rights violations in the United States, published by China’s State Council Information Office, has singled it out prominently every year.  The report released this year quoted FBI figures saying that firearms were used in 71.5 percent of the nation’s murders, 40.8 percent of robberies, and 24.2 percent of aggravated assaults in 2015. It also quoted a report by the Gun Violence Archive that there were 58,125 gun violence incidents, including 383 mass shootings, in the US in 2016, leaving 15,039 dead and 30,589 injured.  A Pew Center survey released in June reveals the US' complex relationship with guns. About 42 percent of US adults say they live in a gun-owning family, and a majority (66 percent) of gun owners say they own multiple guns.Gun owners and non-gun owners not only disagree on gun policy but also disagree on the extent to which gun violence is a problem in the US.  When I visited a gun show at the Howard County Fairgrounds in Maryland a few years ago, I was appalled at the wide range of weaponry available for sale, including many semi-automatic rifles.  The fact that many Republicans and President Donald Trump are not fans of tougher gun policy means that it will be more difficult now for any meaningful changes to be made despite the brutality of Sunday's carnage.  The latest tragedy has also triggered increasing concern and debate in China, especially with more and more Chinese travelling in the US and more Chinese parents sending their children to US schools.  One friend I saw in Shanghai on Tuesday expressed how sad she was learning the news and then asked why someone could own so many guns. Another said he feels China is a much safer place than the US, a view that is voiced by several readers on sina.com.cn.  I have always hoped to be proved wrong. Just like in previous cases, the renewed debate this time about gun policy is likely to quiet down in a matter of weeks, unless the vast majority of Americans demand more sensible gun policies. This would include a soul-searching about the deep-rooted gun culture, and some 300 million guns held by private citizens.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.         "
Tillerson's talk is a counterbalance to recklessness of Trump's tweets,9/29/2017,"                              Secretary of State Rex Tillerson holds a press briefing during the UN General Assembly in New York, US, Sept 20, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be in Beijing this weekend to prepare for President Donald Trump's visit to China and to discuss issues ranging from denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to trade and investment.  The trip comes two weeks after his meeting with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi in Washington. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also visited Beijing early this week, while Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong is in United States this week to co-chair with Tillerson the inaugural China-US Social and People-to-People Dialogue.  Such frequent high-level contacts are a good way for the two nations, which have different cultures, political systems and are at different development stages, to improve mutual understanding and trust, expand cooperation and manage differences.  Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, are regarded as key ""adults"" in the Trump administration, where Trump's loose talk often triggers controversy and confusion in US and around the world.  When Trump tweeted in June that ""While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried,"" it was Mattis and Tillerson who came out to soften the tone. ""We (China and US) reaffirmed our commitment to implement in full all relevant UN Security Council resolutions. For example, we both agree that our companies should not do business with any UN-designated North Korean entities,"" Tillerson said.  Speculation has been rife in Washington in the past two months that the top US diplomat might resign after his reported frustration with Trump on conflicting messages, policy issues and his power in staffing the State Department.  The rift seemed apparent a month ago when Tillerson said that ""the president speaks for himself"" while responding to questions about Trump's words that ""many sides"" were to blame when white supremacists and anti-racism protesters clashed on Aug 12 in Charlottesville, Virginia.  State Department spokesman R. C. Hammond dismissed the speculation, telling Politico that the idea of leaving early has ""never crossed"" Tillerson's mind.  If he was to, his speculated successor Nikki Haley, now US ambassador to the United Nations, looks less diplomatic and much more hawkish. For example, Haley said at the UN early this month that Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un is ""begging for war"". She used undiplomatic language to describe China's proposal for ""dual suspensions"" to the DPRK to freeze its nuclear activity while the US and the Republic of Korea freeze their annual joint military drills, saying ""the idea that some have suggested a so-called freeze for freeze is insulting.""  It would be wise for Trump to keep Tillerson. His departure, if it really happens, will deal a heavy blow to the Trump administration whose credibility depends a lot on its ""adult"" guidance. Tillerson is an essential one.  Tillerson is also good for US-China relations. During his first trip to China in March, he said that the US-China relationship is ""a very positive relationship built on no confrontation, no conflict, mutual respect, and always searching for win-win solutions,"" echoing a proposal made by China in 2012 to build a new type of major country relationship between the two countries.  While Tillerson has no longer mentioned such words following criticism back in the US, the thinking reflected in his March words is critically important for the rising power and the established power to maintain good relations.  With his pragmatic style, Tillerson will find that the two largest economies could cooperate a lot more in dealing with regional and global challenges if they follow the principle he touched on in March, even if he no longer says it publicly for fear of backlash at home.

Trump's speech at UN sends out troubling signals to the world,9/22/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, Sept 19, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Donald Trump's maiden speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday contained, to say the least, disturbing messages. Trump talked about the importance of respecting the sovereignty and rights of every country, saying ""we must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea"", a clear jab at Russia and China.  Yet it was Trump who ordered the 59 Tomahawk cruise missile attacks on Syria on April 7 in clear violation of that country's sovereignty. Worse, he didn't even bother getting UN endorsement for the attacks, unlike what former US secretary of state Colin Powell did, albeit with false evidence, in February 2003 before the US invasion of Iraq.  The arming of the Syrian rebels by former US president Barack Obama's administration was another blatant violation of Syria's sovereign rights. US leaders did not care about such violations when Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush ordered military drone strikes on countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Syria, causing many ""collateral"" civilian deaths.  The NBC News reported on Monday that the Trump administration is contemplating additional policy changes that will further expand the Central Intelligence Agency's authority to carry out drone strikes in a number of countries. Trump, if indeed, is contemplating such a move, will dwarf Obama who had dramatically increased the number of US drone strikes during his eight years in office.  When Trump referred to his administration's recent announcement that ""we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it takes fundamental reforms"", he meant the US will continue to violate the sovereignty of Cuba. The US embargo, imposed more than half a century ago, has caused untold sufferings to the Cuban people.  Trump might not be aware or refuse to acknowledge that the US is isolated on this matter. The UN General Assembly members, including US allies from Asia and Europe, have condemned the US embargo on Cuba throughout the past 25 years. The US abstained last year for the first time, but then Obama, who made the move to regularize ties with Cuba, was in office. Trump's words would only trigger continued condemnation from the UN General Assembly for the 26th consecutive year.  Shortly after his opening remarks, Trump said the US will spend almost $700 billion on its military and defense, claiming that ""our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been"". But is that a message a flexing of military muscles or an invitation to an arms race? The US spends more on its military than at least the next five countries combined.  The US often describes China's defense spending as a threat to regional and global peace. But that is a cunning way to distract people's attention from the huge amount of US taxpayers' money being wasted on the military industrial complex.  Trump once again revealed his love for war (or war of words) when he threatened to ""totally destroy North Korea"" despite every other country saying that there is no military solution to the Korean Peninsula problem.  Unlike those living in the region, Trump has not realized that a total destruction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would be catastrophic for the Republic of Korea and, to a large extent, Japan. It's another matter that the threat of using military power is not at all conducive to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  Trump made his disdain for the UN public when he tweeted last December that the world body is ""just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time"". He might have enjoyed his speech on Tuesday, but might not have realized that many in the UN General Assembly were not having a good time while he was sending out his disturbing messages.

Tapping the full potential of agricultural trade with US,9/15/2017,"                      My discovery on a trip last week to Bozeman, Montana, was not the Yellowstone National Park nearby, but the huge potential for China-US agricultural trade and cooperation.  It was also a feeling Montana ranchers and farmers shared at an agricultural forum with Chinese embassy officials and business leaders in the backyard of Morgan Ranch House. The host, Craig Morgan, was excited about the prospect that quality feeder cattle raised on his open country ranch may finally end up on Chinese dinner tables after China lifted a 14-year ban on the import of beef from the United States.  As the world's second-largest beef importer, China imported about $2.5 billion worth of beef last year. Still, the per capita beef consumption in China is only 5 kilograms a year compared with the world average of 10 kg. So if China's per capita beef consumption increases to 10 kg, it will need an additional 6.5 million tons of beef a year to meet the demand.  The fast-growing middle class in China, estimated at 300 million-almost equal to the US' population-is craving for quality food products from the US and other countries, a craving further fuelled by food safety concerns in China in recent years.  Those representing Montana farms, as in other US agricultural states, are already reaping the benefits of the rising demands in China, as it was the top destination for US agricultural exports last year, with a total value of $21.4 billion. The trajectory looks encouraging as the export of US agricultural goods to China grew 219 percent from 2006 to last year.  ""Cultivating Opportunity: The Benefits of Increased US-China Agricultural Trade"", a US Chamber of Commerce report released last November, predicted an additional cumulative gain of $28 billion in bilateral agricultural trade in the 2016-25 period if the two sides reduce or remove some of their tariff and non-tariff barriers.  The US, as an advanced economy, has much to offer in modernizing China's agricultural sector. It means big business for US agricultural machinery and expertise. That is why US Senator Steve Daines from Montana is strongly opposed to even the idea of a trade war between the two countries, which he believes will cause US farmers and ranchers the maximum loss.  The mood outside Washington is often different. At the Montana forum, farmers and ranchers discussed with Chinese participants how to expand practical cooperation, promote Montana beef in China and establish joint food processing ventures.  US provincial and local leaders, such as governors and mayors, have always been interested in expanding practical cooperation with China, in sharp contrast to many politicians in Washington. A US-China Business Council report released on Sept 7 showed that 432 of the total 435 US congressional districts have seen triple-digit growth in the export of goods and services to China since 2006. China was among the top three goods-export markets for 263 districts last year, and among the top five for 358 districts. It was also the top services-export market for 93 congressional districts in 2015 and among the top five markets for 399 districts.  Outside Washington, it's all about down-to-earth business without even a hint of politics. In Washington, in contrast, President Donald Trump's administration launched an investigation under Section 301 of the US Trade Law of 1974 into China's intellectual property practices last month and threatened recently-after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test-to stop trading with any country that continues to have trade ties with the DPRK, triggering fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies.  China and the US are like great natural partners for agricultural trade and cooperation, and no one should spoil that equation.

Trump should stop issuing irresponsible trade threats,9/8/2017,"                              Supporters wearing cowboy hats listen as US President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during a visit to Loren Cook Company in Springfield, Missouri, US, August 30, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    After the Democratic People's Republic of Korea claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday, US President Donald Trump posted several tweets, including one declaring: ""The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.""    If taken literally, Trump threatens to sever trade ties with not only China, which accounts for most of DPRK's foreign trade, but also with India, Germany, France, Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, Thailand and dozens of other countries that trade with the DPRK.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq all fell on Tuesday, by about 1 percent, on the first day of trading after the US Labor Day holiday. Part of the fall was attributed to the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But if Wall Street had taken Trump's tweet seriously, the market would probably have crashed due to a looming trade war between the world's two largest economies.  China-US bilateral trade exceeded $520 billion last year (the official US figure is $648 billion), making them each other's largest trading partners. According to an Oxford Economics report in January commissioned by the US-China Business Council, US-China trade ties support some 2.6 million jobs in the US across a range of industries. About 150,000 US aviation jobs alone depend on the Chinese market, according to Ray Conner, vice-chairman of Boeing. And China is the US government's largest creditor, holding $1.147 trillion in US Treasuries, according to the US Treasury data in August.  On the other side, millions of Chinese jobs depend on trade with the US, which is by far China's largest export market.  Can the two countries be more interdependent?  So, a trade war, as threatened by Trump using his Twitter account which is followed by 37 million people, would be devastating to both countries. China has long stated that there is no winner in a trade war.  However, this is still an understatement. Given their outsized impact on the fragile global economy and the global value chain, especially in Asia, a US trade war with China would be a trade war with Asia, including countries such as the Republic of Korea, Japan and Australia which are major US allies.  Many US businesses will also be badly hurt because they are part of the supply chain, such as Apple, which marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year.  Many economists say a China-US trade war would quickly set off global recession. I guess the International Monetary Fund, which I visited on Tuesday, is busy revising its World Economic Outlook and searching ways to deal with a global crisis. In its Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific this year, the IMF said the region continues to be the leader of global growth.  It would not be an exaggeration to say a China-US trade war would be like dropping multiple hydrogen bombs on the global economy, which would, among other things, make Trump's campaign promise ""Make America Great Again"" mission impossible.  No wonder US trade experts have quickly dismissed Trump's tweets as an empty threat. It may well be true that Trump, author of The Art of the Deal, just wants to extract concessions from China using the DPRK as a ploy. But threatening a trade war that could have devastating global consequences is not something a US president should do.  Maybe Trump was just distracting the world because the real winner from the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula seems to be the US military industrial complex, as Trump tweeted on Tuesday: ""I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.""  To me, China's response of terming Trump's threat ""unacceptable"" and ""unfair"" is way too polite. As US president, Trump should simply refrain from issuing such irresponsible threats.

Time to cure US of its paranoia about FDI by Chinese firms,9/1/2017,"                      The US administration says it welcomes foreign investment, but it is politicizing Chinese foreign direct investment yet again. Perhaps the US is paranoid about Chinese FDI. An example of its paranoia about Chinese FDI was the Securities and Exchange Commission's order on Aug 9 to put an indefinite hold on a $20 million acquisition of the Chicago Stock Exchange by a group of buyers led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group.  The decision was made after some US congressmen voiced concern that the deal could pose a threat to national security despite the fact that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cleared the transaction in December.  No wonder a recent report in The Wall Street Journal said: ""The Chicago Stock Exchange is a relic of history, trading less than 0.5 percent of US stocks and in such straits that it has been looking for a buyer. That isn't how US officials see it.""  Robert Reed, a columnist with the Chicago Tribune, was more explicit in his column last month, ""Time to OK Chinese investors' controversial Chicago Stock Exchange deal."" In the column, Reed hoped the SEC would not cave to the oversized political anxieties due to doubts that the Chinese government is behind the buyout and could use the exchange to launch cyberattacks or game the US financial market. He said that if given the go-ahead, the deal promises to be a plus for the local economy and a needed lift for the Chicago Stock Exchange. Members of the Chicago City Council also supported the deal.  Reed said it would be a big mistake to slam the door on the deal ""because of unspecified and broad-based suspicions about Chinese government influence or venality"".  The paranoia exhibited over the Chicago bourse deal is one of the many in the US in recent years. Two months ago, Reuters cited an unreleased Pentagon report warning that China is skirting US oversight and gaining access to sensitive technologies through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review. And US lawmakers are drafting legislation to give CFIUS more power to block foreign technology investments.  In February last year, US Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said the acquisition of Swiss agribusiness company Syngenta by ChemChina would threaten US food security. The then Barack Obama administration complied. Later, no plausible threat could be found and the deal went through.  In 2012, Obama personally intervened to block the acquisition of wind farms in Oregon by Chinese-owned Ralls Corp, citing its proximity to a military facility. In the same year, a House Intelligence Committee report described Chinese telecom equipment giants Huawei and ZTE as posing national security threat. For many in the US, the sheer fact that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei once served in the People's Liberation Army is enough evidence for such accusation.  If such US paranoia is justified, the Chinese government should look into major US companies to see if any of their founders and top executives served in the US military or intelligence agencies. The close ties of companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing to the US military should be enough reason to blacklist them for investment in China.  In 2010, MasterCard, VISA, PayPal, Bank of America and Western Union, under US government order, blocked WikiLeaks' banking services after it published US government documents. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, called these institutions ""instruments of US foreign policy"".  If that is the case, the Chinese government should more closely scrutinize these companies which are seeking growing presence in China, in order to make sure they won't disrupt the Chinese market under any circumstances. And this is a serious national security issue.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
"Envoy's job to mend ties, not drive a wedge",8/31/2017,"                              The Commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, testifies before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on ""Military Assessment of the Security Challenges in the Indo-Asia-Pacific Region"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, US, April 26, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      The Washington Post reported on Tuesday Harry Harris, the commander of the US Pacific Command, is likely to be the next US ambassador to Australia.  The Post and several other news outlets focused on Harris' past with a tough rhetoric about China on the maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and assumed he would rally Australia to counter a rising China.  Even though Harris' record seems to justify the speculation, I believe that's an inaccurate job description for Harris, or anyone who takes up that post. His mission should be to improve US-Australia relations rather than drive a wedge between Australia and China, who has had relations grow by leaps and bounds over the past decades.  US-Australia relations took a hit in February after President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the phone over a refugee resettlement agreement former president Barack Obama had made between the two countries. While the two leaders' meeting in New York in May seemed to mend ties, leaked video showed Turnbull mock Trump sarcastically in June at the Australian Parliament's annual midwinter ball.  China is Australia's largest trade partner, with a surplus in Australia's favor. Their bilateral trade is 2.4 times larger than that between Australia and the US. Chinese investment in Australia reached its highest level since the global financial crisis of 2008, at $11.49 billion in 2016, up 12 percent from 2015.  For those who want to play up the threat of Chinese investment in Australia, they should know the accumulated US direct investment in Australia is five times that of China's.  The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in December 2015, has been described by the Australian government as the most favorable trade deal China has ever struck with a developed economy.  Expanding China-Australia ties have gone far beyond trade and investment to include education, culture, science and technology, tourism, political and military areas. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met Turnbull in Canberra in March for the fifth China-Australia Annual Prime Ministerial Meeting. On Aug 28, the Chinese and Australian militaries held their 20th defense strategy consultation in Canberra to discuss bilateral and regional issues.  It is true that like any two nations, China and Australia may not see eye-to-eye on every issue, such as the maritime territorial disputes over the South China Sea. But tension in the South China Sea has greatly eased in the past year. The relationship between China and the Philippines has improved remarkably. China has been working with ASEAN countries to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, deepen their maritime cooperation and push forward consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.  These are positive signs that both the US and Australia should encourage. It is absurd for anyone to assume that China – whose economy, more than any other country, depends on the peace and stability in the South China Sea – wants to destabilize the region.  Some Americans believe Harris, if he does get the ambassador post (as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon hoped he would), wants to prevent Australia from getting too close to China. They expressed deep concern after then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott ignored a US warning in March 2015 and joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  Australian leaders, like other government leaders in the Asia-Pacific, have repeatedly expressed the sentiment that they don't want to be forced to choose between China and the US.  That is what Harris, or whoever becomes the next US ambassador to Australia, should bear in mind.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US' trade policy shows it seeks to be both player and referee,8/25/2017,"                               A container ship docks at the Port of Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang province. [Photo/Xinhua]      The United States launched a Section 301 investigation into China's technology transfer and intellectual property policies and practices last week, raising more concerns about the trade policy of the Donald Trump administration, which is increasingly unilateral, protectionist and rules-breaking.  While the action may reflect the views of some trade hawks in the Trump administration, many US economists have opposed reviving the outdated Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974.  The reason is clear. With its Section 301 investigation the US is trying to be a player and the referee at the same time. The dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization, set up in 1995, is the right place to address such issues.  The US is violating its WTO commitment with its Section 301 investigation. The implication of this is serious. If the US takes the lead in breaking WTO rules, it would set a bad precedent for others to follow suit.  Although the investigation, which might take a year, does not equate to a declaration of a trade war, it is moving in that direction. A trade war between the world's two largest economies, or just tit-for-tat retaliation between them, would be calamitous to not only themselves, but also the global economy, especially those in the Asia-Pacific supply chains.  And the unilateral action, whatever its purpose, is a setback to the progress made between China and the US over the past seven months.  During the presidential race, Trump threatened to impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports from China and label China a currency manipulator. Those threats faded away after he became president, and he and President Xi Jinping had a successful faceto-face meeting in Florida in early April. During the meeting the two leaders agreed on a 100-Day Action Plan for economic cooperation that, having proved fruitful, has now been transformed into a one-year action plan. And a week after the summit, the US Treasury Department determined that China was not manipulating its currency.  The Section 301 investigation has again cast a shadow over the bilateral economic relationship, especially over those industries that will be at the forefront of any retaliation should the worst-case scenario of tit-for-tat actions materialize.  The move is one of the many actions by the Trump administration challenging the US' global and multilateral commitments, which Trump hailed as a good thing in a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday.  In the speech, Trump praised himself for withdrawing the US from the ""disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership"" and ""job-killing Paris Climate Accord"". And he said if the US cannot make a deal, it will probably terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement.  People such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde have repeatedly voiced concern over the surging protectionism in the US. It was the US that refused to renew a longstanding pledge to free trade and rejection of protectionism in the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Germany in March.  When taking protectionist moves, the US likes to blame its economic woes on other nations, painting itself as a victim. However, a recent report by Gary Hufbauer and Lucy Lu of the Peterson Institute for International Economics showed that the payoff to the US from trade expansion is and will be significant, while the 156,250 manufacturing sector jobs lost annually over the past 13 years represents less than 1 percent of the number of people involuntarily separated from their jobs each year.  The 21st century is totally different from Cold War days of 1974 when Section 301 was enacted. The Trump administration should heed the warning of many economists and drop the Section 301 action.

US should make concessions to denuclearize Peninsula,8/17/2017,"                              A Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Type 90 tank fires during their joint exercise, named Northern Viper 17, with US Marine Corps at Hokudaien exercise area in Eniwa, on the northern island of Hokkaido, Japan, August 16, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Many people have heaved a sigh of relief after the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea dialed down their rhetoric over the past few days.  US President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that ""Kim Jong-un of North Korea made a very wise and well-reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable."" It came after the DPRK said it will assess ""the foolish and stupid conduct"" of the US before firing missiles towards Guam.  Trump alarmed the world on Aug 8 by saying that the DPRK best not make any more threats to the US or ""will be met with fire and fury"". The DPRK responded by saying it planned to fire four missiles into the waters off Guam.  The war of words caused grave concern, especially in East Asia. Given the powerful weaponry today, any war would be disastrous to the region, especially the two Koreas.   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis tried to clarify Trump administration's conflicting messages in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. In the article, they said the US has no interest in regime change and no desire to inflict harm on the people in the DPRK.  Such words, however welcoming, ring hollow though, if they are not backed by credible policies and actions. Or they might be overruled by just a tweet from Trump. For instance, the US has an obligation to convince DPRK that it indeed seeks no regime change. After all, it was the US' removal of Libya leader Muammar Gadhafi in 2011 after he gave up his nuclear weapons, and the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 for alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction that has ruined the credibility of the US government.  Mattis and Tillerson are right to say that China has a strong incentive to pursue the same goals as the US – the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula – but they are wrong to think that China can exercise decisive diplomatic and economic leverage over the DPRK.  If China cuts the trade relations with DPRK not prohibited by the UN Security Council, it will inflict enormous harm on the DPRK people and destabilize the region – exactly things that Mattis and Tillerson said they have no intention of doing.   China has made it clear that it will only observe sanctions imposed by the UN and won't observe sanctions unilaterally imposed by the US. The unilateral sanctions reflect US disrespect for the UN by literally saying that it will respect the UN process only when it goes along with the US, otherwise it will ignore it.  The US is also trying to dodge its own responsibility by pushing China to the fore on the issue. The key to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula lies not with China but the US and the DPRK, which are so far unwilling to talk to each other.  It's regrettable to see the US, while seeking China's help, is unwilling to accept the Beijing's ""dual suspension"" proposal – the DPRK halts nuclear tests while the US and the Republic of Korea halt their large military drills – or sign a peace treaty to end the armistice reached 64 years ago.  If it could lead to a possible solution to such a critical issue, why not give it a try? Yes. Past talks have failed, yet that does not mean future talks will fail or fail completely.  The US itself should be ready to make more compromise as a superpower if it is genuine in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

"Climate change brings out the ugly, the bad and the good in US",8/11/2017,"                      What happened in the past two weeks has highlighted the world superpower's leadership and its loss of leadership on the climate front.  First it was the release of the documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power on July 28. Former US vice-president Al Gore inspired the whole world in 2006 with his An Inconvenient Truth, which helped him win an Oscar, and the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.  In the sequel, Gore continues to warn people of the dire fallout of climate change, and also offers hope from increasing global actions, such as in reaching the historic Paris climate agreement in 2015.  An admirer of Gore's work, I was a bit upset watching the movie in the AMC Loews Georgetown due to the poor attendance. I had hoped that such a serious movie would have a box office better than the action movie Wolf Warriors II, which raked in $5 billion in China in 13 days.  After all, 56 percent of Americans named climate change as a major threat to their country, trailing only the Islamic State group, according to a Pew survey released on Aug 1. But why they are indifferent to the movie?  The Barack Obama administration played a critical role in rallying the world in concluding the Paris Agreement, including teaming up with China, and the two countries played exemplary roles in securing the agreement.  However, US President Donald Trump has been busy reversing course. On June 1, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris accord. Last Friday, his administration submitted a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres officially informing him of the US decision, though still leaving the door open for US reengagement if the terms improve.  Under Obama, the US pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28 percent over the 2005 levels by 2025. But Trump regards this as bad for the US economy and jobs and he apparently wants to lower the target.  Trump appointed climate denier Scott Pruitt as director of the Environmental Protection Agency, and proposed to cut EPA's budget by a third. Right after taking office, he signed executive orders to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines.  He also signed an executive order that aims to rescind Obama's Clean Power Plan that caps the amount of greenhouse gases from power plants.  The news this week is that the US Agriculture Department has advised employees to avoid the term ""climate change"" and ""climate change adaption"" and to instead use ""weather extremes"" and ""resilience to weather extremes"".  Meanwhile, a draft government report on climate change is awaiting the the Trump administration's approval. In the report, scientists from 13 federal agencies conclude that people in the US are already feeling the effects of climate change primarily due to human activities.  There is a fierce tug-of-war going on in the US on the climate front. While the Trump administration is reversing course, people like California Governor Jerry Brown have stepped up. Brown talked with President Xi Jinping about cooperation on climate change, right after Trump's announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord. Brown praised Xi for his leadership on climate change when talking on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.  China has made a great leap forward in developing clean and renewable energy in recent years, becoming by far the world's top renewable electricity producer. Yet that is just the first step in the long march to tackle the country's severe pollution and embarking on a sustainable path of ""clear waters, lush mountains"" in Xi's words.  And all indications are that China remains determined and unwavering despite the US' reversal.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Environmental cost of making blue jeans is very high,8/4/2017,"                              Levi's Revel. [Photos provided to China Daily]      When people in the United States talk about blue jeans, they are most likely to mention Levi Strauss, the German-American businessman whose company made the first pair of blue jeans in San Francisco in 1873. Today, the popularity of Levi's, the top brand for Levi Strauss & Co, is not confined to the US; it is a much sought-after brand in more than 100 countries around the world, including China.  A recent article on blue jeans that is burning up social media in China is not about how fashionable distressed jeans are, but about human lives, as its headline says: ""Every Pair of Blue Jeans You Wear is Paid With Lives"".  The author describes the onerous working conditions and environmental damage caused by the blue jeans industry in Xintang town in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province. The author claims that, ""every pair of blue jeans, pricey or cheap, carries sin"". Known as the ""Blue jeans capital of the world"", Xintang has some 3,000 businesses related to the jeans industry. It also meets 40 percent of the market demand in the US.  Careful readers will note that most of the article, especially the photographs, is not new. It gives the same facts that appeared in some articles published a few years ago following a Greenpeace study and a German documentary. In a survey published in 2010, Greenpeace found that at three sampling sites in Xintang, the amounts of lead, copper and cadmium in the riverbed exceeded national limits. The making of blue jeans requires a lot of water and chemicals.  A 2012 German documentary Der Preis der Blue-Jeans (The Price of Blue-Jeans), by Michael Hoft and Christian Jentzsch depicted the poor working conditions, health hazards and severe pollution in Xintang caused by the blue jeans industry, linking them to those cheap jeans that sell for about $10 a pair in stores.  According to the 45-minute documentary, blue jeans are much dirtier than most people might believe. Distressed denim is the result of several chemical-intensive washes, while fabric printing and dyeing involve heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury, which often end up in sewers and water bodies without being adequately treated.  Despite lacking information on the current situation in Xintang, the article went viral on Chinese social media.  Some news reports, however, say the local Xintang government has been trying to address the problem, by cleaning up waterways, relocating factories to several industrial zones where wastewater treatment is mandatory, and setting up a monitoring system.  Xintang is like many industrial towns in China that were heavily polluted because of their export-oriented industrialization, but in recent years they have paid great attention to environmental standards after the central government's prioritized sustainable growth and more and more people became aware of the health hazards of severe pollution.  Interestingly, some of the blue jeans produced in Xintang used to be made in El Paso, Texas, in the 1970s and 1980s, when thousands of workers were making Levi's, Lee, Guess and Gap jeans, according to a story on Atlas Obscura.  US President Donald Trump has again threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese exports, mostly for political and economic reasons. But it seems to me that the Chinese government should impose environmental tariffs on all exports to the US to compensate the Chinese people who bear the environmental costs of providing cheaper goods to US citizens.

"All sanctions, no talks will increase tensions on Korean Peninsula",7/28/2017,"                              Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (middle, front) speaks during a ministerial meeting of the UN Security Council on the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsular, at the UN headquarters in New York April 28, 2017.[Photo/Xinhua]      Susan Thornton, the acting US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, spoke in a Senate hearing on Tuesday about the need to increase the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea so it will give up its nuclear weapons program.  Besides calling for the UN member states to implement their commitments, she said the United States has urged all countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic relations and cut trade ties with Pyongyang.  The strategy is all sticks, no carrots. There is no consideration that less pressure, rather than more pressure, might be a more viable way to achieve the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  The US clearly believes that tightened sanctions will force the DPRK to change course. Yet tougher and tougher sanctions have failed to get the DPRK to halt its nuclear weapons program.  Senior US officials claim that the US wants to bring the DPRK to its senses, not its knees. Yet its strategy suggests that is not the case, and that it wants the DPRK to be on its knees.  US concerns that the DPRK could have a continental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US worsened this week after new assessment by the Pentagon Defense Intelligence Agency showed that the DPRK could have this capability as early as next year.  But the strategy Thornton laid out is deeply flawed because it shows the US is making no attempt to put itself in the DPRK's shoes. Thornton, for example, has not addressed any of DPRK's legitimate security concerns.  The US said it does not seek regime change, but it has threatened various military options. And the US' word does not inspire trust after it helped remove Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi in 2011 after he gave up nuclear weapons and toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003 under the pretext that he had weapons of mass destruction, which it knew did not exist.  Thornton also talked a lot about how China could use its unique leverage, noting that the US would not hesitate to punish Chinese individuals and entities violating the sanctions.  But in doing so, the US has again assumed the role of the world's policeman, something US President Donald Trump said he would reject during his presidential campaign.  Unilateral sanctions imposed by the US outside the UN framework undermine mutual trust and cooperation among nations. Yet the world's only superpower has found it an easy and appealing tool.  Contrary to the claims of its critics, China, which borders the DPRK, has a strong interest in denuclearization of the peninsula, as well as peace and prosperity in the region.  China has been working closely with the US on UN sanctions imposed against the DPRK. Yet the US has rejected China's proposal for ""dual suspension""-the DPRK suspends its nuclear weapons program and the US and the Republic of Korea suspend their large-scale military drills-and resuming the Six-Party Talks and direct talks with the DPRK. The US still insists that the DPRK must first agree to talk about abandoning its nuclear weapons program before any talks can be held.  In Thornton's words, while the US continues to see a negotiated solution as the best way to resolving the problem, the conditions at present are not conducive to dialogue.  It is true that previous talks failed to achieve the goal of denuclearization due to missteps, probably more on the DPRK side than on the US side. But that should not be an excuse for shunning talks on such a critical issue.  What seems certain is that sanctions without talks will likely escalate tensions.

US should throw its weight behind inter-Korean talks,7/21/2017,"                              South Korea's president-elect Moon Jae-in gestures to supporters at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, South Korea, May 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      The proposal, made by Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in this week, to resume inter-Korean dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a welcome move after a long period of provocative actions and harsh rhetoric by various countries.  The meetings on military and Red Cross issues with Pyongyang, if held, will be the first such dialogue since 2014.  China has expressed support for the proposal aimed at improving relations through dialogue and promoting reconciliation, with Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang calling on the international community to give its support.  However, Washington is not happy with Moon's offer, regarding the current conditions ""far away"" from those needed for any resumption of dialogue with Pyongyang.  Views outside the US government are split.  Former US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte believes diplomacy is the only way to resolve the complicated issue. He told a forum in Seoul on Wednesday that ""we need to approach dialogue as a means to solve problems rather than as a reward for good behavior… Neither the US nor South Korea should shy away from bilateral talks with North Korea.""  That was also the message in a June 28 letter to US President Donald Trump signed by six veteran former US officials such as former defense secretary William Perry, former secretary of state George Shultz, and Robert Gallucci and Bill Richardson, both of whom participated in previous talks with the DPRK.  The letter warned that ""there is no guarantee diplomacy will work. But there are no good military options, and a North Korea response to a US attack could devastate South Korea and Japan.""  It is not sure if such a rational argument will convince the Trump administration.  There has been much noise. John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, is right that sanctions on Chinese firms won't be effective in solving the problem. But he is totally wrong when floating a military option in his op-ed in the New York Post on July 5. ""They (China) can work with us or face the inevitable consequences, which will be far more damaging than pinprick sanctions,"" he wrote.  Bolton is right that such an outcome will be damaging to China; that's why China has repeatedly stressed stability and peaceful negotiation to the denuclearization of the peninsula. What Bolton did not mention is that it will be more devastating to the ROK and Japan, two of the United States' closest allies.  China has not only endorsed relevant UN Security Council resolutions, it has also implemented them effectively. China, however, made it clear that it will not cut normal trade ties with the DPRK that are not banned and restricted by the Security Council. Few in the US have probably thought about the kind of humanitarian disaster that would be triggered if the normal trade related to people's livelihoods in the DPRK was suddenly cut off.  Some in the US have even accused China of not wanting to see a unified Korea. That is not true. In my view, China would love to see a unified Korea that is peaceful and stable, not one that becomes a US puppet state, with US troops marching along the Yalu River bordering China.  Some in the US have long been used to others doing exactly what they are told to do by the US, and they are unwilling to listen to China or even the ROK, whose approach to the DPRK is quite different, as evidenced during President Moon's recent trip to Washington.  The whole world knows the US' military might and there is no need to show it time and again. It is time to show wisdom on the diplomatic front through direct talks.

US news media biased reporting destroying trust,7/14/2017,"                              CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY      Like many in China, I have long felt the US news media is biased in its coverage of China. Much of this, in my view, is due to an individual writer's lack of knowledge about China, his or her political bias, or the agenda of his news organization.  As a journalist, I understand the watchdog role of the press. Yet that is totally different from biased reporting.  Americans might see such a problem when they look at the news media's treatment of US President Donald Trump. It is true that Trump has made plenty of controversial or outrageous comments since he started his presidential race, but the US news media's excessive bias against Trump is obvious.  A report in May by the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzed news coverage of Trump's first 100 days in office. It found that 80 percent of the coverage was negative, while only 20 percent was positive. This compared with the 41 percent negative coverage Barack Obama received; and the 57 percent George W. Bush received and the 60 percent for Bill Clinton.  Trump might be the first US president to face the news media head on, calling them disseminators of fake news and dishonest, something that a US president and politician would rarely do given the outsized power of news media today in influencing votes and public opinion.  However, it is clear the US news media is not almighty because Trump won the 2016 election despite a hostile media environment and a predicted landslide for Hillary Clinton, with most major polls concluding a Clinton victory was a foregone conclusion.  A report by senior media writer Jack Shafter and data reporter Tucker Doherty of Politico in May is telling. Some 72 percent of all internet publishing or newspaper employees work in a country where Clinton won. ""By this measure, of course, Clinton was the national media's candidate,"" they wrote.  It is no secret that high ratings are also one of the drivers for the enthusiasm displayed by many US news outlets, especially the cable networks, for biased and sensational reports.  Watching and reading news about China in the US news media gives many Chinese the same feeling of bias. China rarely gets credit for anything, especially when it comes to relations with the US. The narrative is: China is always wrong. China is evil.  I cannot help laughing when watching the superficial and one-sided analysis by some talking heads on US TV networks, especially by someone who has predicted China's collapse multiple times. I wonder why some respected China experts, both in China and the US, are never or rarely invited to talk on TV. Is that because they are too rational and not sensational enough to help TV ratings?  As a Chinese national, I feel the need to go back home from time to time to catch up with the fast changes there. That is also the thinking of many China hands in the US I talked to. It is forgivable that those who have not lived in China or even visited China keep pretending they know all the problems and solutions in China.  The US news media are facing a crisis of low public confidence. A Gallup poll in June revealed that only 27 percent of respondents had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in newspapers, 24 percent said they had high confidence in TV news; and 16 percent said they had high confidence in news on the internet.  If news media are all about public trust, then US news media have failed miserably.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.  chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
It's time US set its own house in order,7/7/2017,"                              A photo of Zhang Yingying released by the police.      The disappearance of Zhang Yingying, a visiting Chinese scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June 9 has shocked many in China and the United States. As people watch closely the court trial of suspect Brendt Christensen, a serious question raised again is: How safe are US cities?  This question has become especially important for Chinese, as an increasing number of them travel to the US as tourists or send their children to US colleges to study. According to the Institute of International Education, more than 328,000 Chinese students were enrolled in US colleges and universities for the 2015-16 academic year, accounting for nearly a third of the total foreign students in the US. The figure, however, does not include a growing number of Chinese children enrolled in K-12 education schools. Besides, the number of Chinese tourists to the US hit 3 million in 2016, and the figure has been growing fast since the US loosened its visa policy in 2014.  Many Chinese know crime rates in US cities are high. Their perception has been largely shaped by Hollywood crime movies, news reports of the huge prison population and frequent mass shootings in the US. In recent years, that perception has been further fed by cases of Chinese students falling victims to violent crimes.  In January 2016, 19-year-old Jiang Yue, a student at Arizona State University, was shot dead in Tempe, Arizona, by Holly Davis after a minor incident involving their cars. In January 2014, Ji Xinran, an engineering student at the University of Southern California, was beaten to death by four people while walking home from the campus. In April 2012, Qu Ming and Wu Ying, two students also of USC, were shot dead in their car, which was parked about one and a half kilometers from the campus.  True, many US cities are safe, even very safe. But the murder rate in US is several times higher than that in China, its neighbor Canada and the industrialized nations in Europe. US President Donald Trump acknowledged this brutal reality in his inaugural address on Jan 20 when he referred to ""the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential"".  On June 30, Trump said he was sending federal help to fight crime and killings in Chicago that have reached ""epidemic proportions"". Chicago has seen 320 murders and 1,703 shooting victims so far this year. Imagine what the situation was like earlier, as I was told by a New Yorker that the crime rate has come down a lot.  Indeed, the rate of violent and property-related crimes has dropped sharply in the US since the 1990s. But it is still much higher than in many countries. The murder rate rose again in 2015, however, and appears to have continued last year. A Pew survey last November showed that 57 percent of the voters in the 2016 presidential election said crime has gotten worse in the US since 2008, a reflection of their deep concern for safety.  Many blame the easy access to guns as a major cause of the high murder rate in the US, while others point to the culture of violence, which is getting worse thanks partly to Hollywood movies and video games with violent content. Some attribute the high crime rate to the stress people are under due to the US' poor welfare system compared with other industrialized nations, for example, in terms of paid leave and free pre-school education.  The US has engaged in incessant wars since its founding 241 years ago and continues to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. It's time it looked inward and waged a war on crime to set its own house in order.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Some in US obsessed with geopolitics,7/1/2017,"                              CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY      That some people in Washington still see China-US relations as a zero-sum game is surprising, to say the least.  At a talk on Chinese direct investment in Latin America held at the Atlantic Council on Monday, Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Sergio Amaral spoke very highly about China's fast-growing trade with Latin America and investment in the region. Chinese investment, Amaral said in his keynote speech, has diversified rapidly into infrastructure and service sectors. A report released the same day said the same thing.  I have interviewed Amaral both in the US and Brazil. As a former chairman of Brazil-China Business Council, he is well versed in Sino-Latin American relations. No wonder his views were corroborated at the talk by Gerardo Mato, chairman of HSBC Global Banking and Markets for the Americas, and Angel Melguizo, head of the Latin American and Caribbean Unit of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Both praised China-Latin America relations.  However, in her speech, Claire Reade, assistant US trade representative for China from 2008 to 2014, expressed concern that the US' ""little brothers"" in Latin America might shift to China and claimed Beijing's involvement in the region was not as a selfless global leader but to fulfill its self-interests. Claiming that China's move is to influence global rules, Reade said: ""China talks about win-win, but many in China have zero-sum game viewpoint.""  Her words reminded me of the slanderous comments about China's role in Africa and Latin America by former US president Barack Obama and secretary of state Hillary Clinton when they visited the regions a few years ago. US politicians are often critical of China's involvement in African and Latin American countries, even though the local people seem happy with it.  Reade is right that China is indeed trying to influence global rules, but only to make them better for emerging and developing countries that did not have much say in rule making in the past.  China is not selfless either; it seeks mutually beneficial ties with Latin American countries. Besides, if China were to turn all the loans into grants, Reade might then accuse it of buying influence.  Despite the geographical distance, China is quickly catching up on its relationship with Latin America. And there is no reason for US politicians to see this as China's geopolitical wrestling with the US, unless they still regard Latin American countries as their ""little brothers"" or ""backyard"" according to the so-called Monroe Doctrine.  Latin America is big enough to accommodate China and the US. The region will benefit if both countries increase their trade and direct investment in the region. The same is true for the Asia-Pacific.  When the Pew Research Center released its survey showing a plummeting US global image at the Brookings Institution on Tuesday, Ely Ratner, a former Obama administration official, claimed that it matters because ""the US is in an emerging geopolitical competition with China"".  Also, he asserted that Asia has great confidence in US democracy despite the survey results showing that 46 percent of the people disliked the US' ideas about democracy, with only 43 percent saying they liked them.  Reade and Ratner might be deeply frustrated with US President Donald Trump's policies, but to criticize China for its active and positive engagement in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific mirrors the zero-sum mentality the Obama administration exhibited in its attitude toward the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  It is okay to criticize China, but if done without a valid reason, it will only discredit such criticisms.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com            "
'Crying' Schumer's rhetoric out of touch with reality,6/27/2017,"                        US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer railed against President Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. However, he sounded as if he might have voted for Trump in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday.  In the article, Schumer blasted Trump for backing off several core campaign positions, including making a stark reversal of his ""tough"" posture toward China.  All these reflect nothing but Schumer's long-term anti-China rhetoric, although it may sound odd for someone who did not even vote for Trump to fervently ask Trump to keep his campaign promise.  It is no secret that most US presidential candidates will say anything to get elected, so it's unrealistic to expect them to keep all their promises, especially those made on the campaign trail.  Former US presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all talked tough on China during their presidential races, but once they were in office, they simply needed to face reality and adopt more pragmatic policies.  After Trump won the election on Nov 8, most economists became deeply worried about the possible trade war between China and the US that might erupt if Trump were indeed to keep his promise of labelling China a currency manipulator.  They also felt it would make the US government laughable, because for the past years, the Chinese government has been propping up its currency, RMB, from falling, which has helped US exports be more competitive.  However, Schumer told reporters on Jan 24 to do exactly that. ""Mr President: if you really want to put America first, label China a currency manipulator,"" he told reporters.  Whatever Schumer's intention is, he is out of touch and misleading people on this very important issue. The consequences would be catastrophic if President Trump had taken his crying seriously.  In April, the semi-annual report by the US Treasury Department on currency practices of its major trade partners found that China has not manipulated its currency.  Last November, Schumer fearmongered about Chinese direct investment in the US. In a letter to then US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and US Trade Representative Michael Froman, Schumer demanded extra scrutiny of Dalian Wanda's acquisitions in Hollywood. ""I am concerned that these acquisitions reflect the strategic goals of China's government,"" he said.  There is growing concern among Chinese investors that fearmongering by US lawmakers could prompt the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to discriminate against Chinese investment.  The good news is that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross assured the Chinese investors attending the 2017 SelectUSA Summit last week that the US will treat Chinese investment fairly.  The 155-strong Chinese delegation to the investment summit at National Harbor, Maryland, was the largest from abroad. If Schumer had visited the US state and city booths at the SelectUSA Summit exhibition, he would be surprised at the enthusiasm in welcoming Chinese investment that helps grow their economy and create jobs.  China and the US have become each other's largest trade partners and most important investors. Such a mutually beneficial relationship has allowed US consumers to save money by buying inexpensive Chinese products. US companies have also expanded rapidly in China, a market of more than 1.3 billion people, including the fastest-growing middle class in the world.  Friction is just normal between two large trading partners. It is true that China, as a country in transition, is still in the learning process in many respects.  The 100-Day Action Plan agreed upon by Trump and President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago is the right approach to address existing bilateral issues. The two governments will also hold a comprehensive economic dialogue this summer.  If sounding and acting tough, as Schumer suggested, will lead to a solution, then it is all too easy to tackle the problems in the world today, including the thorny one on the Korean Peninsula.  What Schumer cannot see is that dialogue based on equality and mutual respect is a better way forward.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com             "
Thucydides's Trap does not have to be inevitable,6/23/2017,"                              US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis meet with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of the People's Liberation Army's Joint Staff Department prior to the US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue at the State Department in Washington, US, June 21, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      Harvard University professor Graham Allison had a question for me when I chatted with him last week about his new book: Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?  He found that some Chinese are uncomfortable with the word ""inevitable"" in his description of the Thucydides's Trap.  ""They say 'war is not inevitable'. I say, 'Correct, correct, it's not inevitable',"" says Allison.  While Thucydides argued that the rise of Athens caused fear in Sparta and made war inevitable, Allison said Thucydides does not really mean inevitable. It was an exaggeration.  He wanted to know what the Chinese understanding of the word ""inevitable"" is. ""Am I falling into a language trap?"" he asked.  I understand Allison's concern. People, both in and outside China, have been talking a lot about the possibility of China and the United States falling into the Thucydides's Trap.  The ""Destined for War"" in the title of Allison's book sounds sensational, but Allison is simply trying to give a warning to the rising power and existing power. They should learn from history to better handle possible flashpoint issues, such as the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and South China Sea. This is despite his firm belief that neither country wants a war with the other-a war that would be mutually destructive and catastrophic to the planet.  Like some other US scholars, Allison seems to believe that China will act just like the imperialist US in the 19th century if it becomes powerful enough, admitting that the US has had more unnecessary wars than necessary wars in its short history.  But China is, of course, not the US. In the last four decades, China has worked to strengthen the existing global governance institutions system such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank rather than undermining them. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative are supplementary to the current global system.  Allison believes both countries need to make some painful adjustments, admitting that the US is only ""slowly"" adjusting to a rising China. For example, he believes that the US does not need to support every claim of the Philippines or Vietnam in the South China Sea.  Such adjustment won't be easy for either of them, especially as the US is feeling deeply anxious about no longer being No 1 in the world in increasing number of areas, and it is showing it is unwilling to share power as much as it should be.  Making compromises or admitting mistakes is no easy job for a superpower. For example, in the past weeks, US officials and lawmakers have called on China to use more leverage to pressure the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to give up its nuclear weapon program. But Allison believes the US has set a bad example in this regard.  The US and its NATO allies pursued regime change in Libya in 2011 after Muammar Gadhafi gave up its nuclear program. The US and its allies also toppled Saddam Hussein in Iraq on the pretext of finding alleged weapons of mass destruction in 2003. Both sent the wrong message to the DPRK leaders.  There is no doubt that the US should take measures to correct its past mistakes in order to inject confidence in possible negotiation on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. How about accepting China's dual suspension proposal-for the DPRK to suspend its nuclear and missile activities, and for the US and the Republic of Korea to suspend their large-scale military drills?

US' lack of focus on its infrastructure means it will continue to get D+,6/16/2017,"                              Engineer Du Hanlin explains skills for diesel locomotive maintenance and repair to trainees from Kenya in Baoji, Shaanxi province. The Kenyan engineers will operate trains on the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, which went into operation on Wednesday. [Photo/Xinhua]    New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman marveled at China's progress in infrastructure in a June 7 opinion piece following his recent trip to the country. He described the wide use of mobile technology in daily life and the changing skylines he saw riding the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed train.    This was not the first time Friedman had lauded China's success and lamented the US' failure in infrastructure.  A day earlier, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: ""Arrived in China, as always impressed by condition of airport, roads, cell service, etc. US needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up!""  Over the years, many US business and government leaders have made such comparisons, most notably recently by US President Donald Trump when he told conservative journalists that ""What China's done is incredible"" and ""We're like a Third World nation"".  As a Washington-based journalist who goes back to China every year, I can attest to the great changes happening in China.  I shared the same feeling in Shanghai in May when I found that so many people, not just the young folks, pay for everything with their smartphones, and bike share services are literally everywhere.  The US used to be the envy of the world for its infrastructure. Yet it has deteriorated so much that the American Society of Civil Engineers graded the US infrastructure D+ in March, the same as the last scorecard in 2013.  China, meanwhile, has made a great leap forward. While infrastructure was the biggest bottleneck to its economic development only 30 years ago, China now boasts many of the world's largest and best ports and airports, longest bridges, largest subway systems, and by far the biggest bullet train system.  In the past decades, China has stayed focused on investing heavily in infrastructure, a major factor fueling its rapid economic growth. The country now hopes to apply the same success in other nations, such as by investing in infrastructure in Africa and Latin America and launching the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative.  I don't see that kind of focus in the US despite the fact that Democrats and Republicans both agree of the need to fix infrastructure at home. During the 2016 presidential race, Trump and his Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all talked about infrastructure as a priority.  However, just as the White House launched its infrastructure week on June 5, the cable news networks, and in fact most of the US news media, focused entirely on the hearing of former FBI director James Comey. In the following days, it was 24/7 coverage of testimony by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. On Wednesday as I was writing this column, it's been nonstop about a shooting outside Washington that injured Congressman Steven Scalise.  These events were important, but they didn't deserve the hyper-attention they received in the US, from the news media to Capitol Hill.  Comparatively, the news media has never devoted much air time and space to covering infrastructure and Congress has never held many hearings on infrastructure despite the fact that its crumbling status poses a serious threat to the nation.  ""Every Week Should Be Infrastructure Week,"" cried out an article last month by Joseph Kane and Adie Tomer, two scholars at Brookings Institution.  But it seems impossible to make the importance of infrastructure stick. Unless the US switches its focus to roads, bridges and airports, it will be hard for its infrastructure to get a better grade than D+.

"It's the planet, stupid, not China's global leadership",6/9/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump announces his decision that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1. [Photo/Agencies]      It was sad to hear US President Donald Trump's announcement last week to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement. And it's puzzling to see so many people interpreting it as the US ceding the global leadership to China.  The Paris accord, adopted in December 2015 and signed by 195 United Nations member states, is about efforts to combat climate change rather than a geopolitical jostling between the US and China. It was actually the close cooperation between the two countries and their determination and commitment to combat the global challenge that led to a relatively speedy acceptance of the Paris agreement. And the US was expected to play a leading role in implementing the accord despite the agreement not being enough to limit the average global temperature rise to 2 Celsius above pre-industrial figures. Therefore, the US' withdrawal will jeopardize global efforts to save the planet.  Yes, it will also be a blow to US leadership in the world. But focusing on or condemning it as the US ceding global leadership to China is simply a wrong approach.  ""Trump hands the Chinese a gift: the chance for global leadership,"" read a headline in The New York Times on June 1. ""If Trump doesn't want a world leadership role, China will take it"" was the headline of a June 2 article on US News and World Report. Similar claims by climate experts, such as Barbara Finamore of Natural Resources Defense Council, were even more surprising. ""Trump's Paris withdrawal cedes global leadership to China"" was the title of her article on NRDC website on June 2.  Officials and climate experts in the NRDC, a global environmental advocacy group, should focus more on how Trump's decision is going to ruin the planet, rather than on China assuming or not assuming global leadership. If there is a race in clean energy, it should be a friendly one because the world, especially the developing world, needs more clean technology. It shouldn't matter whether it comes from China, the US, the European Union or any other economy, because the aim is to fulfill the goals set in the Paris agreement.  Politicians, political pundits and climate experts, like former US vice-president Al Gore, are happy that China, India, the EU and the US state of California have reiterated their commitment to the Paris agreement and vowed to do even more to save our planet. Premier Li Keqiang made that statement publicly during his visit to Europe last week.  China cannot celebrate the US' withdrawal from the accord or the void it has created in global climate leadership, as some in the US have speculated. It would indeed serve China's interest if the US remains a party to Paris accord. Unlike the US, China has never claimed to be a global leader even though it is playing such a role in some areas, especially climate change. Given the severe air pollution, China is facing a huge challenge on the environmental front. Yet its success in harnessing clean energy and determination to fight climate change have impressed the world.  Beth Gardiner, a London-based environmental journalist, wrote last month from East China's Zhejiang province that Chinese manufacturing has changed the economics of renewable power around the world, making solar power generation cost-competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels like natural gas and even coal. So instead of sounding sour on China's success in the clean energy sector, people should celebrate it. The world can be a better place if every country steps up to play a leadership role and fill the huge void created by the US' pullout from the Paris pact.  It's a pity that some people see the great cause of combating climate change through their narrow geopolitical lens.

Brzezinski and his insightful wisdom will be missed,6/3/2017,"                      The passing of Zbigniew Brzezinski last week came as a shock because a little more than a month ago he was still making public appearances and commenting on the Korean Peninsula issue. In the past week, many of my Chinese journalist friends who had interviewed him or attended his lectures recalled on WeChat Moments their fond memories of the great strategist.  For many of us, Brzezinski was a man of wisdom with a great understanding of the world and China. As the US national security advisor in the Jimmy Carter administration, Brzezinski played a key role in the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China in 1979.  He enjoyed a friendly relationship with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. I heard Brzezinski mention that friendship several times, including at a film show last November at the Meridian International Center in Washington where the documentary, Mr Deng Goes to Washington, chronicling Deng's historic visit to the US in January 1979, was screened.  While most people may remember the image of Deng donning a 10-gallon cowboy hat at a rodeo show in Texas, Brzezinski had fond memories of Deng having dinner prepared by his wife Emilie and waited on by his three children at his home.  To my generation, Brzezinski was one of several wise US politicians known to Chinese. Others included former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and former US national security advisor Brent Scowcroft. I first saw Brzezinski in 2004 when he delivered a speech at the Oksenberg conference room at Stanford University.  After Brzezinski retired as the US national security advisor in 1981, Deng told him that he was welcome to travel anywhere in China. Brzezinski expressed his intention to travel with his children along the historic Long March route that the Red Army undertook in 1934-36. Deng agreed.  However, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials did some homework and found out that it would be very difficult to make the trip because much of the Long March route was still inaccessible to vehicles. Brzezinski said at the seminar that they managed to travel only a short section of the Long March route.  When I posted this anecdote on my WeChat Moments on Saturday, friends praised Brzezinski for his charisma. I attended quite a few lectures of Brzezinski in the past four years in Washington. While I did not agree with everything he said, I have always admired his wisdom and insight.  Brzezinski was not shy of criticizing people in his own Democratic Party. For example, he said Susan Rice, US ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013, lacked the necessary diplomatic skills when she used ""disgusting and shameful"" to describe the veto by China and Russia of a UN Security Council resolution on Syria. Of course, the veto came after the US and its NATO allies had abused a UN Security Council resolution in 2011 to pursue regime change in Libya.  Brzezinski was also blunt about US surveillance of China's coast and believed it to be an unnecessary provocation. ""We do something to the Chinese every week that we wouldn't like them to do us,"" Brzezinski told a seminar in October 2015. China has long protested surveillance by US military planes and ships, a Cold War legacy, as a provocative action. While fully aware of the differences between China and the US, Brzezinski always believed it was important for the two countries to cooperate in order to resolve regional and global issues.  I tried to attend every lecture of Brzezinski in the past years. And it is hard to believe that when I return to Washington on June 1 after my vacation in China, Brzezinski will no longer be there.

"US, DPRK are key to denuclearization of Korean Peninsula",4/28/2017,"                              A submarine-launched ballistic missile is displayed during a military parade in central Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has become ever more complicated due to the words and deeds of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.    The DPRK's fifth nuclear test last September and its continued missile tests in the past months have violated the United Nations Security Council resolution and posed a threat to regional stability. More economic sanctions by the Security Council will be warranted if such violations continue.  The United States has not made the matter any better by flexing its muscles. On Wednesday, some 2,000 US and the Republic of Korea troops took part in a military drill just 30 kilometers south of the Demilitarized Zone, a day after the DPRK held its own artillery drill. The USS Carl Vinson and other warships are cruising toward the area in what US President Donald Trump earlier described as ""an armada"".  On Wednesday, Trump and his senior officials held a classified briefing with US senators. The words that came out of that meeting have been relatively moderate compared with the warmongering rhetoric in the past weeks. The US now says it aims to pressure the DPRK into dismantling its nuclear, ballistic missile and proliferation program by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with the US allies and regional partners.  It did not say what steps the US will take to ease the tensions, although starting to install the US' missile defense system in the ROK is not likely to do so.  There has been much talk in the US that actions by China will be essential. They believe China should cut off all economic ties with the DPRK. That is wrong-headed. China has implemented the UN Security Council resolution on the DRPK. It would be unreasonable and unrealistic for China to cut all economic ties, a move that will cause a huge humanitarian disaster and destabilize the region.  Some in the US even floated the idea to arm the ROK with nuclear weapons and encourage Japan to develop its own bombs. Some still believe that a military option is viable.  Such thinking can be summarized in one word: simplistic.  Those who believe that more economic sanctions will bring the DPRK to its knees have forgotten that all five DPRK nuclear tests since 2006 were conducted under the UN sanctions and the US unilateral sanctions. No one should assume that more sanctions will magically work.  China is deeply worried about a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula right on its border. Who would not be? The ROK and Japan, which host the US troops, are probably concerned that a war in the region will devastate their cities and people.  The US said it will not tolerate the DPRK having ballistic missiles that can hit US, but it has not addressed the DPRK's concern for its own security. Despite the US assurances that it is not pursuing regime change, such words have no credibility after the US invaded Iraq in 2003 to remove Saddam Hussein under the false pretext of weapons of mass destruction. Its regime change in Libya in 2011, ousting Moammar Gadhafi after he gave up his country's nuclear weapons program, will also have suggested to the DPRK that it should hold on to its nuclear program if it wants to prevent similar US aggression.  In this sense, the US should correct its mistakes, such as by signing a peace treaty with the DPRK, heeding the Chinese proposal to resume the Six-Party Talks, and implement the ""two-suspensions"": The US suspends its joint drills with the ROK while the DPRK suspends its nuclear test.  The key to denuclearization is in the hands of the DPRK and the US. China can help if both of them refrain from taking provocative actions.

US must send a thank-you note for yuan policy,4/21/2017,"                              A worker counts Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB) at a bank in Linyi, East China's Shandong province, Aug 11, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]    China is not a currency manipulator, US President Donald Trump and the US Treasury Department ultimately said earlier last week. Yet the same conclusion has been reached in the past by many US economists, including former US treasury secretary Larry Summers who admitted the US government was wrong all these years in trying to push China to shore up the yuan when market forces were keeping it down.    Economists and leading currency experts such as Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution have argued in the past that China is not manipulating its currency. And if China is doing so, it is only to prop the yuan up, not to keep it down, which incidentally does the United States a big favor by strengthening the competitiveness of its exports.  When Trump tweeted, ""Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!"" on Sunday, he seemed to suggest he was doing China a favor by not labeling it a currency manipulator. The fact is, the US probably owes China a thank-you note for helping prop up the yuan.  The same is true for the US' trade deficit with China, which crossed $300 billion last year. Trump and his Cabinet members such as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross continued to blame China and other countries such as Germany and Japan despite wide consensus among economists that it was a wrong approach to look at the issue.  On March 31, Trump ordered a study into the causes of the US trade deficit-a study that will focus on trade barriers and unfair trade practices in foreign countries.  The trade deficit figure, however, is greatly inflated. A report prepared by Oxford Economics for the US-China Business Council in January shows that as China has become an integral part of the global manufacturing supply chain, much of its exports comprise foreign-produced components delivered for final assembly in China. If the value of these imported parts is subtracted from China's exports, the US' trade deficit with China will reduce by half, to about 1 percent of GDP, about the same as its trade deficit with the European Union.  Apple's iPhones are an apt example of such products. China contributed only about $15 in added value to an iPhone but each set added about $600 to China's exports. That is why the trade deficit looks so huge and is misleading.  Most economists believe the US should not be rattled by its trade deficit with China. If the US stops buying goods made by labor-intensive industries from China, it will need to buy them from other low-cost countries, thereby increasing its trade deficits with those economies, and its total trade deficit will more or less be the same.  Economists also believe trade deficits have more to do with fiscal policy rather than trade policy. They agree that trade barriers do not cause trade deficits. A country can have a trade deficit even by borrowing from the rest of the world, as the US has been doing for decades.  Over the past decades, products from China's manufacturing sector have lowered prices for US consumers, helping control inflation and saving Americans' money, according to the Oxford Economics study.  Besides, economists should also calculate the staggering environmental cost Chinese people have paid to make these goods, for which China deserves another thank-you note, instead of finger-pointing, from the US government and consumers.

Unquestioning US media failing in its role to hold government to the law,4/14/2017,"                              Internally displaced people who fled Raqqa city stand near tents in a camp in Ain Issa, north of Raqqa, Syria on April 3, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]       The Pulitzer Prize, which was awarded this Monday, recognizes journalists' excellent work in questioning and investigation. It put into sharp contrast the lack of quality reporting on Syria by the US mainstream news outlets.  The April 4 chemical weapons attack in Syria which killed civilians, including children, was shocking. The perpetrators, whoever they were, should be identified and punished.  Yet before any investigation could even be carried out, the US government decided unilaterally it was the Syrian government army that launched the attack. US President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike on the Syrian al-Shayrat air force base. Besides destroying military jets, the air defense system and other logistical facilities, the bombing killed and injured a number of civilians.  In the past week, the US mainstream media has mostly focused on Trump's U-turn in his Syria policy, or whether it means another Iraq type of war. Few have asked whether it was the Syrian government army or the opposition army that used the chemical weapons or whether the US airstrike violated international law.  It reminds many of the situation in 2003 when then US secretary of state Colin Powell went to the United Nations to make a case for invading Iraq. The argument was later found to be based on false evidence.  Although they were sharply critical later, the unquestioning US news media at that time has been widely viewed as strengthening the credibility of Powell.  According to a University of Maryland study, 57 percent of US mainstream media viewers at the time believed Iraq supported al-Qaida and was directly involved in the Sept 11 attacks on the US in 2001. And 69 percent believed that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the 9/11 attacks.  None of these was true.  This time, US mainstream news outlets, except the public service network C-SPAN, did not even cover the heated debate at the emergency meeting on Syria at the UN Security Council on April 7, where diverse views were presented.  For example, Bolivian ambassador to the UN Sacha Llorenti, holding an enlarged photo of Powell in his 2003 presentation at the UN, said the alleged weapon of mass destruction was never found. Sweden's ambassador to the UN Olof Skoog claimed the US missile strike ""raises questions of compatibility with international law.""  Under international laws, such an airstrike on a country would require the mandate of the UN Security Council unless the US was acting in self-defense.  It was not just the mainstream media. Opinion leaders in major US think tanks did not question the strike much either. Except for the libertarian Cato Institute, few raised any questions about the legality of the airstrike. Of the five Brookings Institution scholars who posted their comments on the institute's website after the US attack, only one, Chuck Call, raised the issue, saying ""the act reflects a disregard for multilateral organizations and approaches, and its international legal basis remains unclear"".  Charlie Savage of The New York Times was probably one of the few US journalists to delve into the legality issue. His lengthy article on Friday called the air strike into question under both international and domestic laws.  As nations make their stances known, one obvious question that should be raised is how some countries can support the US airstrike at the same time they are pushing for an international investigation. If you support the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles as a punishment for the Syrian government, you must be certain who was the perpetrator. But when you support an investigation, it means that you are not absolutely sure who actually used the chemical weapons.  I have not heard such a basic question raised by US mainstream media.

Top-level meeting can forge good personal rapport,4/7/2017,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in the southeastern US coastal town Palm Beach on April 6, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      There has been much speculation about what issues should be talked about, or even resolved, when President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump meet at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. However, the goal of their first meeting should be to build a good personal relationship that facilitates a constructive and productive relationship between the two countries.  This is especially true given that the Trump administration is less than 80 days in office, with many official positions yet to be filled and several cabinet nominees still to be confirmed.  The new US administration has not rolled out a comprehensive foreign policy and trade policy, except what Trump had said on the campaign trail, or tweeted or mentioned in casual conversations since his inauguration.  The China-US relationship is immense and consequential. A good personal relationship between the top leaders would enable their countries to greatly expand the areas of cooperation in the years ahead while effectively addressing differences. It would help prevent the two nations from drifting into a strategic rivalry or triggering the so-called Thucydides trap between a rising power and the existing power, as many worried might happen during Barack Obama's eight years in office.  Despite their growing economic interdependence, China and the United States still have vast potential for win-win cooperation that is untapped. Concluding a Bilateral Investment Treaty will be one way for them to inject new momentum into both economies.  With its impressive record in infrastructure construction in the past decades, China can play a positive role in helping accomplish Trump's ambitious plan to fix the crumbling infrastructure in the US.  The US could also adopt a more positive attitude toward the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative (the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road), which aim to facilitate regional connectivity and economic development. The thinking that the US should not endorse any China-led initiatives reflected the zero-sum mentality of the previous administration, and is an attitude Trump needs not inherit.  There is a host of regional and global challenges that require China and the US to work together, from counter-terrorism and fighting epidemics to improving global governance and reviving the world economy. White House officials and many US pundits have put the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and some trade and investment issues between China and the US on top of the agenda for meeting.  Such issues call for China, the US, and other parties involved, to conduct more consultations, rather than taking unilateral actions, to resolve them.  The same is true for bilateral economic and trade issues. Many US economists, for example, believe that blaming US trade deficits and job losses on China or Mexico is missing the big picture, and such misguided analysis will only lead to wrong policies.  For all these reasons, it is unrealistic to expect quick results from the first informal summit between the two leaders. But if they can build a good personal rapport, it would be easier for the two countries to sort these things out in the days and years ahead.

Giant pandas bring Chinese and Americans closer together,3/31/2017,"                              Giant panda cub plays with a zoo keeper at Chongqing Zoo in Chongqing, Southwest China, March 18, 2017. [Photo/chinanews.com]      People in the United States like to petition, about everything, from demanding President Donald Trump to release his tax returns to ending wildlife trafficking.  But a recent one calling to reunite giant panda cub Bei Bei and his mom Mei Xiang at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington sounds a tearjerker.  In the petition, J. J. Medusa accused the zoo of forcibly separating the two giant pandas. It described them as ""vocalizing, pacing, not eating and visibly stressed"" and ""they have been calling to each other and literally climbing walls (and trees) to try to get to one another"".  It went on to say that ""it breaks our hearts to see these two beautiful creatures apart from each other.""  The petition, which started three weeks ago, has gathered some 2,500 signatures and has been spreading on social media.  Living just a block from the National Zoo, I shared the petitioners' feeling having observed the difficult days of weaning of Bei Bei from his mother. However, I understand that is a natural process for giant panda cubs.  Just a day before the National Panda Day on March 16, the zoo released a list of frequently asked questions in response to the many giant panda fans who expressed similar concerns. Pandas are solitary animals, they do not live in groups. Mothers and cubs do not stay together in the wild. If the zoo were to keep them together much beyond the point when a cub is self-sufficient, that would eventually cause aggression.  Bei Bei and Mei Xiang looked quite good in adapting to the new life in their respective yards when I visited them again this week.  The love for giant pandas among Washingtonians, and many Americans, impressed me deeply since I was still based in New York City and travelled to Washington in late 2009 after the zoo announced that giant panda cub Tai Shan was to leave for China.  People, some in a group called Pandamania, and some in wheelchairs, came to say goodbye to Tai Shan, even on snowy days. The Metro card in Washington even carried a giant panda logo.  There is no doubt that giant pandas are China's ambassadors to the US. They are stars at the National Zoo. The web cams there often draw 1 million viewers on a weekend. Bei Bei's name was given by China's First Lady Peng Liyuan and then US first lady Michelle Obama in September 2015 when they both visited the cub at the zoo.  The National Zoo was the first one in the US to house giant pandas after Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing arrived on April 16, 1972, about six weeks after President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China. The welcoming ceremony a few days later was attended by first lady Pat Nixon. The green shipping crate for Ling Ling is still on display in the panda pavilion.  Besides Washington, three other US cities, San Diego, Atlanta and Memphis, also house giant pandas. James Sasser, former US ambassador to China, mentioned to me once how proud he was of helping bring giant pandas to his hometown Memphis.  New York City is probably the next one. In February, local Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney joined former AIG billionaire Hank Greenberg and others in pushing for a campaign to bring pandas to the Big Apple by 2020, to be housed either in the Central Park or the Bronx Zoo.  As I studied the Nixon archives online recently, I came across a conversation between Nixon and his wife Pat about the arrival of the first pair of giant pandas. Having giant pandas in the US was a major step in China-US relations, just like that historic Nixon trip.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Proposal for new type of power relations still a win-win proposition,3/24/2017,"                              President Xi Jinping tells visiting US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that the nations should enhance exchanges at all levels. They met on Sunday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]      Right after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrapped up his visit to China on Sunday, the Washington Post declared that Tillerson appeared to hand Beijing a diplomatic victory.              The Post article went on to scold the top US diplomat after he described the US-China relations as ""a very positive relationship built on no confrontation, no conflict, mutual respect, and always searching for win-win solutions"".  Tillerson's words came as a surprise, to the delight of many in Beijing but the dismay of some in Washington. The proposal made by China in 2012 to build a new type of major country relationship between China and the US based on ""no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation"" was aimed at avoiding a disastrous war if the established power became too fearful of the rising power.  While meeting President Xi Jinping in California in June 2013, then US president Barack Obama appeared to accept the idea of a new type of relations. But his administration then stayed away from it, interpreting it as away for China to tell the US to keep quiet no matter what China does.  It was a major distortion of the Chinese proposal which clearly acknowledges the issues existing between the two countries, issues that should be resolved peacefully, with mutual respect and through dialogue, rather than confrontation.  By rejecting the Chinese goodwill proposal, the Obama administration made a huge mistake in this regard. Strategic distrust and rivalry between the two countries worsened under Obama.  The same kind of not handing China a victory mentality seemed also behind the US opposition to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and its Pivot to Asia strategy that aimed to curtail China's influence in the region.  Thus, the endorsement of the Chinese concept by Tillerson is simply correcting a mistake made by Obama. Hopefully, Obama's successor Donald Trump will reiterate that when he hosts Xi in Florida next month.  That endorsement does not mean that either side should be shy of disagreeing with the other. For example, the two countries agree on the goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, but their approaches are not the same.  While Tillerson said all options, including military ones, are on the table, China has called for calm, restraint, dialogue and diplomatic solution.  China has endorsed UN Security Council resolutions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its violation in missile and nuclear tests. But China believes that diplomacy, rather than just sanctions, will lead to a solution.  A similar view is held by former US defense secretary William Perry who visited the DPRK to negotiate denuclearization during the Clinton administration. Perry argued in a March 10 article that the DPRK might well agree to give up testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and agree not to sell or transfer any of its nuclear technology, in return for economic concessions from the Republic of Korea and security assurances from the US.  Many who have threatened war on the Korean Peninsula have not thought through the consequences it will have and the huge damages it will inflict on the region.  There are many differences between China and the US. But as long as they are willing to work in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, they are more likely to find a solution, narrow differences and avoid the Thucydides trap.

Blaming China will not help solve the US' economic woes,3/17/2017,"                              Tourists and downtown workers are pictured in front of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, July 8, 2015. [Photo/IC]      Speaking in Michigan on Wednesday afternoon, US President Donald Trump continued to blame the North American Free Trade Agreement for the loss of nearly a third of US manufacturing jobs and China for the loss of 60,000 factories since China's accession to the World Trade Organization.  During the confirmation hearing of US Trade Representative nominee Robert Lighthizer on Tuesday, Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow from Michigan asked why Trump didn't keep his campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office.  Peter Navarro, director of Trump's new National Trade Council, railed against China's currency policy and blamed China, Germany and others for US trade deficits in his speech at the National Association of Business Economics last week.  It seems that pretty soon, they will blame China for the winter storm that hit Northeast US on Tuesday, paralyzing major cities such as New York and Boston, grounding more than 6,000 flights and killing more than a dozen people.  In sharp contrast, I cannot recall any senior Chinese officials or delegates to the just concluded sessions in Beijing of the National People's Congress, the top legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body, blaming the US for such things as the US' disastrous meddling in the Middle East or how the US should be held responsible, at least partly, for the serious pollution in China.  There is ample evidence to support the argument that the manufacturing of export goods to the US and the rest of the world is a big contributor to China's carbon emissions.  While many in the US criticize China for its carbon emissions, they clearly have not thought that US per capita emissions are more than two times the per capita emissions in China and the US is responsible for the historical accumulation of carbon emissions.  Chinese leaders, however, have not used finger-pointing to distract public attention. Instead they have chosen to tackle the challenge by strengthening regulations, investing in clean and renewable energy and switching the economy onto a more environment friendly path.  They clearly know that blaming others for your own problems may deflect public criticism but it does not solve the problems.  For example, China is not manipulating its currency to help its exports, something Premier Li Keqiang made clear at a news conference on Wednesday and most US economists agree. If Trump had named China a currency manipulator on Day One as Senator Stabenow wished, it would only have made the US president a laughing stock.  For the same reason, the US has the largest trade deficit with China but it also ran trade deficit with another 100 countries in 2015. Economists such as Stephen Roach and Robert Reich believe the true problem is not China, but the low saving rate in the US and too many people living beyond their means.  The calculation of the trade deficit has long been misleading because it includes added value from other places such as Japan and South Korea, which have moved their assembly lines into China in the past decades.  In fact, when Trump was speaking outside Detroit, Michigan, he should have acknowledged that China now generates a third of General Motors' global sales. Also, Michigan has attracted $3 billion in investment from China since 2000. Some 300 Chinese companies have made a home in Michigan, creating jobs for Americans.  I have interviewed Michigan governor Rick Snyder and know how passionate he is about the trade and investment relations with China.  Working with China, and looking into its own problem, instead of blaming others, would clearly help the US better solve its economic problems.

Time for a change to one-size-fits-all retirement policy,3/11/2017,"                      There were many takeaways for Chinese observing the 2016 US presidential election. One was the apparent energy exhibited by the three candidates Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail, all above or approaching the age of 70.  On the Nov 8 election day, Sanders was 75, Trump 70 and Clinton 69. With long and successful careers either in politics or business under their belts, the three-all grandparents-were not only not ready to retire, but were all eager to write a new chapter in their lives.  In the United States, there is no mandatory retirement age for most professions. There are ages when people can claim their full Social Security, Medicare and other benefits, but that doesn't mean they have to leave their jobs.  In stark contrast, retirement ages are mandatory in China. Under laws enacted in 1978, men retire at 60, while women retire at 55 if they are public servants or 50 if they are blue-collar workers. There are some exceptions for people with a certain standing in the hierarchy.  It is a huge waste of human resources considering that people aged 50 to 60 are usually the most experienced in their jobs. It is especially true given that the average life expectancy in China had increased to 76.3 by 2015, compared with only 67.9 in 1981. In Shanghai, it is now 83.  Just imagine someone graduating with a PhD at the age of 30 being forced to retire after just 30 years of work, or 25 if she is a woman and face discrimination in both age and gender.  China has been considering raising the retirement age. But the rationale has mostly been that it would cover the shortfall in pension funds in a rapidly aging population, rather than tap the human capital of its population.  The plan submitted last year was expected to be officially announced this year after public deliberation. The initial plan reportedly aims for implementation in 2022 after a five-year transitional period starting this year that will raise the retirement age by about six months each year.  But Yin Weimin, minister of human resources and social security, was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as saying on March 1 that due to heavy employment pressures, the government will take a more cautious approach in formulating the new policy.  While setting an age when people can claim their social security insurance makes as much sense in China as it does in the US, a mandatory retirement age is not appropriate for many professions. The current one-size-fits-all policy does not take into account the factor that each person is different. The mandatory age for women even makes less sense.  If the Chinese are impressed by the ""still young"" spirit displayed by the three US presidential candidates in the 2016 election, for years many have also been ""surprised"" to find that the flight attendants on many US airlines are not as young as those on Chinese airlines.  Two years ago, when Shanghai-based Spring Airlines announced it was raising the maximum age of new flight attendants to 40, it made headlines in China. Indeed, flight attendants in China are mostly in their 20s and 30s.  A story posted on the website of non-profit organization American Association of Retired Persons is entirely different: Barbara Beckett, in her early 70s, recently retired after 53 years on the job with American Airlines. Beckett recalled that when she graduated from stewardess school in the 1960s, flight attendants were required to be single and could be fired if they got married, exceeded a certain weight or reached the age of 32. But that age limit was abolished in 1970.  The 2016 US presidential candidates and flight attendants certainly challenge Chinese thinking about age and retirement.

Lessons can still be learned from Nixon's historic trip 45 years ago,2/24/2017,"                              Chairman Mao Zedong meets then US president Richard M. Nixon at Zhongnanhai in Beijing on Feb 21, 1972. [Xinhua]       Tuesday marked the 45th anniversary of the historic trip to China by US president Richard Nixon, a trip that ended more than two decades of hostilities between the two nations and a trip that Nixon called ""a week that changed the world"".  As people keep speculating on how the China-US relationship might evolve under the administration of President Donald Trump, it might be useful to reflect on the wisdom, courage and vision Nixon showed back then.  In announcing his trip on national TV on July 15, 1971, Nixon said there could be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the People's Republic of China and its 750 million people (now 1.3 billion), and that was why he had undertaken initiatives to open the door for more normal relations between the two countries.  Nixon stated that the trip was not directed against any other nation, saying ""we seek friendly relations with all nations. Any nation can be our friend without being any other nation's enemy"".  He said all nations would gain from a reduction of tensions and a better relationship between the United States and China. ""It is in this spirit that I will undertake what I deeply hope will become a journey for peace, not just for our generation but for future generations on this Earth we share together,"" he said.  While some thought that the trip would help settle all the issues that existed between the two countries, Nixon was not naïve. In a talk with Dutch prime minister Barend Biesheuvel on Jan 26, 1972, he noted that the visit meant that the US and China would begin a process of getting to know each other.  He was well aware of the great gulf between the two countries in ideologies and even interests but he believed the two nuclear powers needed to find ways to talk and get along.  Nixon believed the contact would help reduce the chance of a confrontation between the two countries in the immediate future, such as the one they had on the Korean Peninsula and the one they had indirectly in Vietnam.  And as if knowing that China would rise on the world stage just a few decades later, Nixon said when China becomes a superpower and a nuclear superpower, having that kind of relationship meant it was not inevitable there would be a clash.  In a talk with US senators Allen Ellender and Michael Mansfield on Feb 29, 1972, immediately after his trip to China, Nixon pointed out that it was not shared beliefs that brought China and US together, but their common interests and common hopes.  Given his long anti-communist credentials, Nixon's move was politically incorrect at the time for many right-wing conservatives in the US. Nevertheless, he displayed courage in doing the right thing, even though it was not a popular move for many.  There is no doubt that the normalization of the relations started by Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and Nixon all those years ago has helped ensure peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world since.  Compared with the Nixon years, the common interests and challenges that require close cooperation between China and the US, the world's two largest economies, have grown dramatically.  They include everything from global economic growth, to counter-terrorism, climate change, epidemics and cybersecurity. The list goes on, not to mention a probably longer list in the ever more interdependent bilateral relationship.  Despite the wishful thinking of some, Chinese and Americans are not going to be the same, but they are much closer thanks to a relationship started by Chinese and US leaders 45 years ago.  Indeed, many of Nixon's words still sound quite relevant for addressing bilateral, regional and global issues today.

"Contrary to claims, Trump has shown diplomatic wisdom",2/17/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump (R) laughs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a joint news conference at the White House in Washington on Wednesday. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Donald Trump has taken a lot of heat for stating in a ""lengthy"" and ""extremely cordial"" phone talk with President Xi Jinping last week that he would honor the one-China policy. He was mocked and criticized for ""backing away from a fight"" and ""blinking first"".  His critics seem anxious to stir up trouble between the world's two largest economies.  What Trump did is simply correcting a mistake he made in the past few months, when he spoke on the phone with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in early December, when he told Fox News a few days later that ""I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things"" and when he told the Wall Street Journal in January that ""everything is under negotiation, including 'One China'"".  Such a departure from the diplomatic protocol of China-US relations naturally drew strong protests from China, and rebukes from many in the United States, including ironically some who later chided him for his about-face.  Zhicuo nenggai, shan modayan is a Chinese proverb from a story about China's Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) more than 2,000 years ago, which is equivalent to the Western saying of ""A fault confessed is half redressed.""  Should we expect Trump not to reverse course but go down the wrong path of flirting with ending the one-China policy? That would spell disaster for the US, the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and indeed the region and world.  Such a correction mechanism has also been seen with regard to the remarks of Rex Tillerson. During his confirmation hearing for secretary of state on Jan 11, Tillerson said China could be denied access to some of the islands in the South China Sea, raising speculation that tensions would escalate in the waters.  That speculation, however, was largely defused when US Defense Secretary James Mattis said in Tokyo early this month that the US does not see any need for dramatic military moves in the South China Sea.  The same diplomatic wisdom was exhibited by Trump at his joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last Friday. When a reporter from Sankei Shimbun, a right-wing nationalistic paper in Japan, asked how he intends to deal with China in the South China Sea and on currency, Trump did not take the bait, as his predecessor Barack Obama probably would have.  Instead, Trump emphasized that he had ""a very, very good"" conversation with Xi. ""I think we are in the process of getting along very well. And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan,"" Trump said.  Besides being diplomatic, Trump's answer reflects much-needed wisdom that was lacking in the Obama administration. Obama's rebalancing to Asia strategy was aimed at driving a wedge between China and its neighbors.  That zero-sum thinking has not faded away today despite the fact that Obama has stepped down. Many pundits and interest groups continue to peddle articles and research papers advocating that policy these days trying to influence Trump's policy.  Many Chinese were not sure about Trump at all before he took office, yet were willing to bet that a businessman is usually a realist who likes win-win game.  It's a big bet. But as long as the Trump administration discards the zero-sum mentality, and works with China to expand cooperation and manage disagreements, it might be a worth-while bet.

Made in USA is hypocritical political correctness,2/10/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump speaks while signing executive orders at the White House in Washington January 24, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Donald Trump won the 2016 election partly by cashing in on people's anger over excessive political correctness. Yet his words and deeds are cultivating a new political correctness in his country.  It is about keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States and bringing them back from overseas, as he said in his inaugural address that his rules are ""buy American and hire American.""  Walmart, the largest US company, has been running a TV ad about its commitment to purchasing $250 billion in the US and create 1 million jobs at home.  It is nothing new for US businesses to promote themselves by tapping into the public's patriotism, but more of them are under pressure now to do so after Trump threatened to punish those outsourcing their jobs abroad.  Under such pressure, Carrier decided in late November to keep several hundreds of jobs in its Indiana plant instead of moving them to Mexico as previously planned. Last month, Ford Motors cancelled its $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and said it would instead invest $700 million in an existing plant in Michigan to make electric and autonomous cars.  Trump also warned General Motors last month by tweeting ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!""  He has pressured Apple CEO Tim Cook to make iPhones in the US, instead of China, where the devices are assembled by a massive army of Chinese workers.  Such a bid to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US may sound great to some voters. But it is against the free market principle, does not make any economic sense and won't help US consumers.  The Walmart commercial features a factory scene where workers are hammering and welding, with sparks flying like fireworks. It does not look remotely like a factory with state-of-the-art facility or high automation, which should be the case for an advanced economy.  Walmart's campaign has already been called into question when some products with ""Made in America"" labels are accused of not meeting the government criteria, as many parts are made abroad.  In a globalized world, it is increasingly hard to find a product, especially a high-tech one, that is made totally by one country. Apple's iPhones are assembled in China but really designed in California. Its parts come from more than 700 suppliers from all over the world, and the assembly cost is less than $10, not big value.  US consumers, however, will have to pay $30-40 more if they want an iPhone assembled in the US and $100 more if more of the components are made in the US.  The Made-in-the-USA mania now seen in the US is not only against the basic economic law of comparative advantage, it is also going to hurt the most vulnerable US consumers and turn the US into a ""Third World"" economy.  In fact, the factory scene depicted in the Walmart ad is probably hard to find now in China's developed coastal region. Those factories have long been relocated to the low-cost hinterland of West China or else to other countries which have lower labor costs.  As a shrewd businessman, Trump should know all this well. The United Kingdom's Daily Mirror reported last week that Trump International Hotel, opened in Washington last October, contains rooms where almost everything in them was made outside the US.  It is sad to see such hypocritical political correctness of Made in USA permeating the world's most advanced nation in the 21st century.

Cooperation could make both China and US great again,2/3/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump shows the Executive Order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after signing it in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, USA, January 23, 2017. [Photo/IC]      The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is dead, at least for the time being. But instead of dissecting US President Donald Trump's problematic trade policies, many are quick to point out that it will create a rare opportunity for China, especially in pursuing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, in which the United States is not participating.  Indeed, many Chinese may have heaved a sigh of relief or even felt like celebrating when Trump signed the executive order on Jan 23 to withdraw the US from the TPP. But this was largely because the TPP had been aggressively sold by former president Barack Obama as a geopolitical tool against China, part of his rebalancing to Asia strategy. It is hard to remember all the times Obama repeated such toxic rhetoric as ""we can't let countries like China write the rules of global economy"", given how many times he expressed such sentiments.  The problem with the TPP was exactly it was promoted more as a means to wrestle economic influence in the region from China rather than a free trade deal. Does that mean that even Obama was not sure about TPP's economic benefits, so he had to peddle it to lawmakers and to the US public by scaremongering about China?  Some US economists have pointed out that the TPP's economic benefits to the US are quite limited, or even negligible. If that is true, then US workers had every reason to oppose the TPP since it was based more on geopolitical concerns than on the well-being of average Americans.  Despite the fact that the TPP was touted by the Obama administration as an FTA of the 21st century, there is no doubt that the RCEP, as a genuine trade deal, is more befitting of that description, as it is a step toward greater regional economic integration and will inject vitality to the already most economically dynamic region in the world. In this regard, it should absolutely be applauded.  Unlike the TPP, the RCEP has never been sold as a geopolitical game against the US. It can't be given that many RCEP parties are US security allies. But the fact that the RCEP is a free trade agreement rather than a geopolitical tool shows its superiority to the TPP.  Let's be clear. China won't and can't dictate the RCEP. The 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as Japan and India are some of the heavyweights in the group.  Unlike the US, China believes in a multipolar world rather than a unipolar world. It means that China would prefer a kind of collective leadership in RCEP or any multilateral organization.  ""Adopting international norms"" has been the catchphrase since Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping launched the country's reform and opening-up drive in 1978. China has gained a lot in the past decades by learning from and abiding by international norms.  However, China still has a lot to learn and catch up on in that process, especially in international governance. The US, Europe and other advanced economies should be a bit more patient.  The 50 US states, for example, are vastly different. Should California, the state with the strictest environmental law, demand that Texas or Ohio change their local environmental rules before trading with them? Or should New York and Massachusetts exclude Mississippi and Alabama from the table because their social agendas are not nearly as progressive?  China and the US should find common ground and pursue win-win cooperation rather than indulging in zero-sum thinking. By expanding win-win cooperation, the US can help make China great again while China can help make America great again.

US states legalizing the use of marijuana baffles many Chinese,1/20/2017,"                              Melvin Clay of the DC Cannabis Campaign holds a sign urging voters to legalize marijuana, at the Eastern Market polling station in Washington, in this November 4, 2014 file photo. [Photo/Agencies]      A puzzling occurrence to many Chinese visiting the United States in the last four years is that marijuana has been legalized by a growing number of states, and support for its use among the public is also rising.  This is quite a contrast to the fact that most people in China still associate drugs with the country's bitter Opium War in the mid 19th century, a war forced upon it by the British to legalize its opium trade in China.  So far, 29 US states and the District of Columbia have legalized the use ofmari-juana for medical use, and some of them have also allowed recreational use since the states of Colorado and Washington became the first to legalize recreational use in 2012.  A Pew Center survey last October found that 57 percent of US adults said the use of marijuana should be legal, while 37 percent said it should be illegal. The view a decade ago was the reverse, with just 32 percent favoring legalization and 60 percent opposing it.  A Gallup poll found that 13 percent (or 1 in 8) of US adults in 2016 said they were using marijuana, while that number was only 7 percent in 2013.  A US federal law states it is illegal to use, possess, sell, cultivate or transport marijuana. But the federal government has articulated that if a state passes a law to decriminalize it for recreational or medical use, it can do so under the condition that a regulation system for marijuana is in place.  Marijuana, also called cannabis, grass, weed or pot, is listed as a Schedule I sub-stance by the USD rug Enforcement Administration, along with heroin. The DEA defines a Schedule I drug as a sub-stance that has a high potential of being abused and has no accepted medical uses.  The debate about the pros and cons of marijuana is far from over in the US, and it goes far beyond the health and medical realm. A Washington Post report last October said police make more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.  Barack Obama, the US president, at time of writing, and former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, along with many other politicians, have all admitted to once using marijuana.  While more US states are likely to legalize marijuana in various forms, it is unknown what president-elect Donald Trump's administration will do about it. His pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is well known for opposing the legalization, saying in last week's confirmation hearing that he ""won't commit to never enforcing federal law"".  The change in the US has not gone unnoticed in China, especially after the high-profile August 2014 arrest in Beijing of American-born Hong Kong actor and singer Jaycee Chan Jo-ming, son of the well-known martial artist and actor Jackie Chan. Jaycee Chan was found guilty of possessing 3 ounces of marijuana, which was found in his apartment.  Like most countries in the world, possession, sale, transportation and cultivation of marijuana is illegal in China.  In arguing for legalizing marijuana, many Americans have traced its medical use back to ancient China. But for many Chinese, marijuana is a drug and there-fore synonymous with opium, a much more potent substance that the British forced upon the Chinese during the Opium War. The war was widely regarded by Chinese as the start of their country's ""century of humiliation"".  Such a bitter collective memory means it would be much harder for any prospects of legalizing marijuana in China. In 2014, after the arrest of Jaycee Chan, the People's Daily warned that legalizing marijuana would be a disaster for the nation.  To me, the pungent smell of marijuana increasingly experienced on the sidewalks of Washington is an unpleasant addition to an otherwise beautiful city.

Time for US politicians to stop misinforming public about China-US relations,1/13/2017,"                              US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive to board Air Force One for travel to Chicago to deliver a farewell address, from Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, US, January 10, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Barack Obama did not forget to poke China even in his farewell speech in Chicago Tuesday evening, saying that ""Russia and China can not match our influence around the world unless we give up what we stand for.""  On the same day at the United States Institute of Peace, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, with successor Michael Flynn by her side, declared that ""failure to move forward on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement) is eroding American regional leadership and credibility, with China standing to gain strategically and economically.""  Such unprovoked jabs once again reflect the zero-sum mentality of Obama and some of his aides on international relations. Under Obama, the geopolitical rivalry between the United States and both China and Russia has deteriorated. People never hear Chinese leaders using such toxic language about the US in their speeches to the Chinese public even though they have plenty of ammunition.  However unpredictable president-elect Donald Trump might be, I feel a bit relieved knowing that Obama only has less than 10 days in office, so I don't have to hear him yelling again ""the US, not China, should make the rules"".  A Pew Center survey a year ago showed that only 38 percent of Americans have a favorable view of China, compared with a global media of 55 per-cent across 39 countries. That in part has to do with the toxic rhetoric about China frequently spewed out by Obama and other US politicians.  For these politicians, demonizing China is a good distraction from the US' own problems.  While Obama touted the US was the world's wealthiest and richest nation on Tuesday, what appeared in my mind is the homeless on the street in freezing winter days in Washington and New York City. The Washington Post reported that the number of homeless families in the US capital has soared by more than 30 per-cent compared from a year ago.  Most Americans don't have a sense of the real picture of international affairs, especially China-US relations, after hearing repeatedly the toxic rhetoric from their politicians.  For example, the US-China Business Council, which represents more than 200 US companies in China, released a report on Tuesday on US-China trade relationship. The report finds that the rhetoric about the negative impact of China on US economy is both misleading and exaggerated.  Instead of killing US jobs, it finds trade with China is responsible for the creation of 2.6 million American jobs. Trade with China has helped boost US economic growth and helped a typical US household save up to $850 in 2015. Meanwhile, the trade deficit, which Trump likes to fear monger, is grossly over-exaggerated.  It is a report that speaks very positively of the US-China economic relations. However, when I asked USCBC President John Frisbie why US leaders such as President Obama have never talked about these huge positive aspects to the US public, he politely chose not to answer the question.  It is despicable that Obama and other US politicians, who are well aware of the hugely mutual beneficial trade relations, have chosen to keep silent all these years while letting fake news and misinformation about bilateral trade relations spread and indeed spreading themselves.  It is no secret that US politicians like to use fake news and misinformation to their own advantage. People have seen plenty of the tricks in the last presidential election cycle. Now after the election, Democrats and Republicans are fiercely accusing each other of disseminating fake news.  It is time to stop the spreading of fake news and misinformation about China-US relations.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US and China should learn to tango rather than fight a trade war,1/6/2017,"                              Smoke is discharged from chimneys at a plant in Huai'an city, East China's Jiangsu province, Jan 31, 2015. [Photo/IC]      The severe smog that shrouds Chinese cities and the traffic woes that haunt US cities are reminders of how much the two countries can learn from and help each other in tackling such issues instead of engaging in a trade war which the incoming US administration has hinted it will initiate.  This week, Beijing is once again under a very high alert, shortly after a red one, the most severe smog warning in a four-tier system, announced on Dec 16.  Amid the New Year holiday celebrations and partying, the toxic smog that has blanketed the Chinese capital has become the most talked-about subject of all domestic social media. People's anxiety has reached levels never seen before. They have compared notes on which masks are the most effective and most have expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts made to tackle the smog in the past years, which have made little progress.  ""Smog terror,"" ""nuclear winter"" and ""gas chamber"" are just some of the words used to describe the horrendous air pollution.  It is true that the air pollution smog may not disappear in the coming years, but it would reassure people that the fight will one day be its severity lessens rather than worsens. While the Beijing authorities reported this week that there had been more good air quality days last year than the previous year, that the situation is improving is not the general impression the public has.  There are strong doubts that all the environmental laws and regulations are being strictly enforced, and whether the Ministry of Environmental Protection and its subsidiaries have the necessary teeth, as their counterparts in other countries have.  For example, Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution 20 years ago. Yet a University of Southern California study released a year ago showed that air pollution has declined significantly over the past two decades. As a result, residents are healthier, especially in lung function and lung growth among children.  Stricter regulations and strong enforcement are regarded as a major contributor to the improvement. The state of California, where Los Angeles is located, is now the leader in environmental technology and standards.  That is what China, Chinese cities and provinces should aspire to be in combating air pollution. And it will be a win-win if the two countries strengthen cooperation in this regard.  Everyone loves blue sky. However, it is joyless to see fellow Chinese taking and posting pictures of clear blue sky in Beijing because it's so rare.  While Chinese visiting the US often marvel at the clear sky in the US, many Americans who visit China often praise the high-speed trains and smooth subways.  The Wednesday morning train crash in Brooklyn, New York, which injured more than 100 passengers, came three months after a train crash in Hoboken, New Jersey, that killed one bystander and destroyed part of the historic train terminal.  One of my fellow Chinese journalists based in Washington described her recent ride on the slow and wobbly No 7 train from Flushing, Queens, to the Times Square as torture. Asked why New Yorkers don't complain about this, one fellow American journalist, a New Yorker, replied: ""Maybe people are just used to this.""  The same problem exists in Washington DC's Metro system which is finally undergoing massive repairs after ignoring decades of warning. Major delays caused by scheduled and unscheduled repairs are commonplace in the US capital.  China has done a marvelous job in building its subway systems. Both Shanghai and Beijing have built subway systems whose total length is greater than that of the one in New York City in about a decade, while the Second Avenue Subway in New York took literally a century to be completed and opened to traffic on Jan 1.

Abe's no-apology Pearl Harbor visit serves no purpose,12/29/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lay wreaths at the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii on Dec 27, 2016. Carolyn Kaster / AP      Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Barack Obama stood side by side at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, talking about reconciliation between the World War II foes and their growing postwar security alliance. Abe hopes his visit to Pear Harbor in Hawaii will resolve the historical issue, at least between the United States and Japan.  In his nearly 17-minute speech, Abe, to no one's surprise, offered no apology for the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941, which drew a then reluctant US into World War II. Without an apology, the entire Abe speech, however emotional it was made by an interpreter, sounded hollow in essence. The speech only signaled that the sensitive but critical historical issue between Japan and the US is still unsolved.  Abe had indicated earlier that he would not have to offer an apology because Obama did not offer one in May when he visited Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities where the US dropped atomic bombs in August 1945.  When I pressed US State Department spokesman Mark Toner on the issue on Tuesday afternoon, he dodged my questions, refusing to say whether it's appropriate for Abe to compare the two historical issues, whether the US and Japan have settled the historical issue as Abe claimed or whether the US will still seek an apology from future Japanese leaders for the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Bilateral ties between Japan and the US were dealt a blow when US president-elect Donald Trump declared he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement after he enters the White House. Trump has also said that he does not want the US to foot the bill for Japan's security. So, the emphasis by Abe and Obama on the alliance is aimed at reinforcing the relationship before Trump takes office on Jan 20.  The reason that Abe did not and would not offer an apology is simple. Right-wing Japanese groups, Abe's core supporters for a long time, don't want him to.  Hundreds of thousands of US soldiers died during World War II. The Hacksaw Ridge, a biographical film still running theaters both in the US and China, uses the story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic, to show some of the sacrifices the US made to eventually defeat the Japanese fascists.  But the number of Americans who died fighting Japanese forces was much smaller than the number of people killed by the invading Imperial Japanese Army in China and other Asian countries .  Abe is notorious for his revisionist view on Japan's wartime past. That's why in an open letter to Abe last year, more than 200 Western scholars, including Ezra Vogel of Harvard University, urged him to face squarely Japan's wartime past.  But the adamant Abe refused the Republic of Korea's request in October to send letters of apology to former ""comfort women"", a euphemism for women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army. Just a few days ago, some former ""comfort women"" protested against a deal between Japan and the ROK on the issue, saying it does not cover those women from other countries.  As many as 200,000 young women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and East Timor were kidnapped by Japanese soldiers during the war years and forced into sexual slavery.  While Abe tried to tell the world on Tuesday to not mention the infamous part of Japan's history, many Chinese are waiting to see whether he visits the Nanjing Massacre Museum to offer both ""everlasting condolences"" he mentioned on Tuesday at Pearl Harbor and a sincere apology.  It is puzzling why it is so hard for Abe to just say the word ""apologize"" to seek the forgiveness of nations and people that were victims of Japanese atrocities. This is even more surprising when one considers Germany's postwar reconciliation with other nations.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Navarro another blow to US-China ties,12/24/2016,"                        US president-elect Donald Trump is known for his anti-China rhetoric on the campaign trail, such as threatening to impose up to 45 percent tariffs on Chinese products and calling China a currency manipulator.  Yet when Trump named China-friendly Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to be the United States ambassador to China, and his senior advisor James Woolsey said Trump may consider joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative (the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road), it momentarily seemed the president-elect may have started to see reason.  Wednesday, however, dampened that hope, as Trump nominated Peter Navarro to head the new White House National Trade Council. Trump's transition team described Navarro as a ""visionary economist ... (who) will develop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth, and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores"".  It is still unclear what will be Navarro's relationship with the still-to-be-announced US trade representative, and commerce secretary-nominee Wilbur Ross, a sensible businessman I chatted with and interviewed in New York years ago. But one thing is certain: Navarro is a known China hawk.  Back in August 2012, I had criticized a documentary based on the 2011 book Death By China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action by Navarro and Greg Autry, calling it ""hate speech against China"". I described his key points: China is bad in every respect. China is stealing American jobs, killing its babies with unsafe toys and its army is preparing to kill Americans. In a country known for making great movies, I wrote at the time, a trash production called Death By China which reminded one of Nazi propaganda should not make it to even the screen.  The China bashing by the conservative professor at University of California-Irvine, also includes his other books, such as The Coming China Wars (2008) and Crouching Tiger: What China's Militarism Means for the World (2015).  People who read the reviews on amazon.com will find that The Coming China Wars is ""China bashing at its worst"" and ""meant to terrify you"" and ""simplistic and exaggerating"". The Crouching Tiger also portrays China as a military threat to the US in a biased and sensational way.  In other words, Navarro is hardly a visionary. He is deaf and blind to the enormous win-win cooperation and potential of China-US relations, whether in trade and investment or in tackling regional and global challenges.  Trade is a form of cooperation and the $550 billion annual bilateral trade has brought huge benefits to the peoples of both countries. What Navarro and Trump have in common is to demonize trade, especially the US trade deficit with China.  The feeling that US trade deficit with China is in China's favor is both politicized and misleading. For example, each iPhone that Apple sells in the US adds some $200 to the US-China trade deficit. This means iPhones alone add $6-8 billion to the bilateral trade deficit each year. And what does China make from iPhones? A ridiculously small amount of about $10 from each, say many economists.  If the US lifts its outdated restrictions on high-tech exports to China, its trade deficit will shrink dramatically or could even be reversed.  In an article written for Project Syndicate last week, Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad, an economist and currency expert, criticized Trump for accusing China of currency manipulation, saying there were no facts to prove the charge and by ""getting tough"" on China, Trump would hurt both economies.  Many scholars have warned about the devastating effects on the US, China and the rest of the world a trade war will have if Trump were to truly put his tough talk into action. Navarro's appointment only adds to such concern.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com     (China Daily 12/24/2016 page5)         "
US government being hypocritical in accusing others of war on media,12/16/2016,"                      Sarah Sewall, the US under secretary of state for civilian security, democracy and human rights, spoke recently of how freedom of information and freedom of the press form the bedrock for US foreign policy.  She lashed out at China and Russia, saying that a recent report found that the Chinese government and its legions of helpers write nearly a half billion fake posts a year, and that the Russian government spends at least $400 million a year on its propaganda machine of bots and trolls and factories of false content to undermine trust in independent media.  She then claimed that the US ramped up support in Europe for civil society and media most vulnerable to Russian pressure by more than 50 percent to over $85 million.  Sewall's allegations against the Chinese and Russian governments are yet to be substantiated, while her admission that the US government spent $85 million on propaganda in Europe raises questions about the US government meddling in its media.  Sewall quickly left after the six-minute speech she gave at a seminar in honor of the 250th anniversary of Sweden's Freedom of the Press Act.  The event touched on much of the challenges the media face in the US today, especially under President Barack Obama's administration.  In the 2016 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, the US ranked 41st out of 180 countries. Its standing in 2015 was 49th. Such a relatively low ranking, behind Slovenia (40), Ghana (26) and Namibia (17), hardly looks like the robust media freedom that Sewall touted.  The Reporters Without Borders report blasted the US government's ""war on whistle blowers who leak information about its surveillance activities, spying and foreign operations, especially those linked to counter terrorism"" and the lack of a ""shield law"" in the US to help journalists protect confidential sources.  Sam Sanders of National Public Radio reported that Obama's Justice Department has cracked down on reporters in an effort to prevent leaks; it also set a new record for withholding access to government files under the Freedom of Information Act (despite Obama calling for a ""new era of openness"" on his first day in office).  A study by the Columbia Journalism Review found that relations between the White House and the news media have never been so controlled in the past 50 years, saying that the ""White House is determined to conceal its workings from the press, and by extension, the public.""  New York Times reporter James Risen last year called the Obama administration ""the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation"". Risen was beseeched by the Obama government to identify his confidential sources for parts of a 2006 book in which he detailed a CIA plan to undermine Iran's nuclear program.  At the seminar, veteran US journalist Marvin Kalb shared his personal experiences covering the Vietnam War and talk-ed about how presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did not like his reporting that was critical of US foreign policy. Some reporters in his time ended up on the ""enemies list"", their phones being tapped and income tax returns scrutinized every year.  He lamented that there are many ways the government even in a free country can put the pressure on a reporter, but added that many reporters acted more aggressively under such pressure.  Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of Newseum, noted the high societal pressure on journalists in the US today. Feed-back on reporters' stories often includes hateful or vitriolic comments. He admitted that some US reporters tend to censor themselves under such a public backlash.  It would be good if Sewall had also reflected on the US government's war on the media before pointing fingers at other governments.         "
Trump's pick for US ambassador to China a hopeful sign,12/9/2016,"                              Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump meets Iowa Governor Terry Branstad as he speaks during Iowa Senator Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines August 27, 2016. [Provided to China Daily]      US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday his intent to nominate Iowa's longest-serving governor Terry Branstad to be his administration's ambassador to China, an appointment well received in both China and the United States.  Though speaking no Chinese, Branstad is well-known for his long-standing friendship with China and in particular with President Xi Jinping. The two first met in 1985 during Xi's first trip to the US with an agriculture delegation from North China's Hebei province. Branstad was in his first term as governor.  Branstad invited Xi, then China's vice-president, back to Iowa in 2012. Over the years, Branstad has led four trade missions to China and made China one of the top trade partners of Iowa, a major agriculture producer of soybeans, corn and pork.  I was in Iowa in early 2013 when Branstad spoke at events marking the 30th anniversary of the sistership tie between Iowa and Hebei, established in 1983 when Branstad was governor. I interviewed him on phone in September last year just days before Xi paid a state visit to the US and before Branstad went to Seattle to meet Xi. He talked at length about how he and those in Iowa who hosted Xi in 1985 were so proud to be referred to by Xi as ""old friends"".  There is no doubt that Trump's decision, though described by some as a political payback, is a goodwill gesture to China and reflects his willingness to maintain good US-China relations.  This is despite his blunder last week to take the phone call from Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, thus seriously breaking decades of protocol between China and the US since they established diplomatic ties in 1979.  The Chinese government has shown much restraint in responding to Trump's erratic behavior in a hope to have a smooth start with the next US administration. After all, China-US relations is just too important to be ruined by one incident.  But Trump and some of his advisors need to understand that the Taiwan question is not something to be flirted with. The question hits a nerve of each and every Chinese on the mainland and it is one of the core interests for China. Trump also needs to listen to smarter advisors when he, through his Twitter last week, accused China of depreciating its currency, an allegation that is contrary to both facts and the assessment by US Treasury Department. What the Chinese government has been doing is just the opposite-preventing the yuan from depreciating. And this is great news for the US economy, according to people like Fred Bergsten, top currency expert of Peterson Institute for International Economics.  Despite the much talk among Americans about Trump's inconsistency and unpredictability, it is too early to tell anything about Trump given his inauguration is still more than 40 days away.  However, there is much hope among many Chinese that as a businessman, Trump will be more interested in pursuing practical win-win cooperation with China instead of indulging in geopolitical games.  The third round of the China-US High-Level Joint Dialogue on Cybercrime and Related Issues held this week in Washington is a good example how the two nations can turn a once contentious issue into new highlight of bilateral cooperation. Both stand to win when they join hands to fight cybercrime and maintain a hotline instead of shouting at each other through their news media outlets.  There are so many areas for potential win-win cooperation for the two nations. Sending Branstad to China is a positive sign that Trump wants to tap that potential.

Will Trump walk the talk on his vow to drain the swamp?,12/3/2016,"                              US President-elect Donald Trump speaks at election night rally in Manhattan, New York, US, November 9, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      On the campaign trail President-elect Donald Trump swore that he would drain the swamp in Washington if elected. Reflecting the American public's great distaste for Washington, his words were hailed by fervently cheering crowds.  In January, Rasmussen Reports, which specializes in the collection, publication and distribution of public opinion information, showed that 81 percent of Americans believe Washington is corrupt. A Gallup poll in September 2015 found that 75 percent of Americans saw widespread corruption in the country's government, a jump from the 66 percent in 2009.  On Nov 16, Trump announced his anti-corruption campaign by setting out tough restrictions on lobbying by incoming officials. The rules require incoming officials to terminate their lobbying registration and pledge not to lobby again until five years after they leave the administration.  Although no one seems sure how the rules will be enforced, it is a move in the right direction.  The horde of passengers getting off at Farragut North station on the Red Line of the city's metro rapid transit system every morning is quite a scene on my way to work. Outside the stop is the notorious K Street, the nickname for the lobbying industry where major lobbying companies assemble.  Having covered Washington for years, the question I often ask is why the thriving lobbying industry in Washington is even legal in a country that claims to be the world's ""greatest democracy"".  In Washington, countless former government officials and ex-Congressmen engage themselves in the lobbying industry, using their connections and influence to push special interest agendas and enrich themselves. With the ongoing US government transition, many who are leaving the Barack Obama administration will be sought after by major lobbying firms or may be planning to start their own lobbying companies.  If people believe that guanxi (connections) is uniquely Chinese, it is because they have not lived in Washington, where some 11,000 lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, are trying to use exactly that with the US Congress and federal government departments.  Chinese journalists covering Washington are often surprised to find a State Department official who briefed them about the US government's Asia and China policy just weeks ago suddenly appearing as the head of a consulting company, and his business having questionable links with his previous official duties.  Such revolving door cases are indeed a normal phenomenon in Washington.  For years, the top industries that have spent the most on lobbying include pharmaceuticals, insurance, business associations, oil and gas, education, telecom services and defense aerospace.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that corporations are scrambling to retool their lobbying efforts as Republicans, preparing for control of the House of Representatives, Senate and White House in January, hope to break the partisan logjam that has blocked the passage of legislation for six years. Key issues for their hired guns will be immigration, healthcare, tax, infrastructure and Wall Street regulations.  Andrew Bacevich, a historian at Boston University, wrote on Tuesday that if Trump was serious about overturning the Washington establishment, he'd start by ending the constant wars. In Bacevich's view, wars created the swamp in the first place. Wars empower Washington. They centralize, providing a reason for federal authorities to accumulate and exercise new powers.        What he failed to elaborate is that a huge lobbying industry, especially representing the giant military industrial complex, is keeping those wars going.  With so much talk about many of Trump's nominations for the Cabinet belonging to the swamp, it will be interesting to see if Trump will walk the talk on his ""drain the swamp"" pledge.

Hopefully death knell for TPP signals US is about to change tack,11/25/2016,"                              Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct. 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]      US President-elect Donald Trump, his opponent in the election Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and many Chinese have at least one thing in common. None of them is fond of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement; although for very different reasons.  Clinton, when as US secretary of state, called the deal agreed among 12 Asia-Pacific countries the ""gold standard"" for trade agreements, but she opposed it while campaigning in order to win more union voters.  Trump has been more consistent. He has repeatedly called the TPP ""a potential disaster for our country"", and he announced on Monday the first thing his administration will do is to withdraw from the agreement.  For many Chinese, the death knell sounded by Trump is welcome news because they don't have to listen to President Barack Obama banging the drum for the US, ""not countries like China"", writing the trade rules.  Such words sound not only humiliating to many Chinese, but also ridiculous and highly hypocritical.  Why on earth would anyone think China, with one-fifth of the world's population, should not participate in writing global trade rules, or any global rules? For Obama to think like that is akin to wishing that all the states that were won by the Republicans should not have been allowed to vote in the presidential election.  Excluding China from the discussions on drawing up the global rules and norms reveals an anti-democratic mindset, not to mention that China, rather than the US, is now the world's largest trading nation.  The fact that Obama has constantly used the TPP in its rebalancing to Asia strategy has altered the meaning of a free trade agreement as he has made the free trade agreement a US foreign policy tool.  The TPP's economic benefits are controversial to say the least. Some US economists who studied the documents carefully concluded that the economic benefits to the US are quite limited, in contrast to the praise heaped on it by US officials in lobbying Congress and the American public.  Some multinational corporations may be the winners with the TPP, but many US workers and communities vulnerable to free trade agreements are likely to suffer. Over the years, the US government has done a poor job in helping them.  The opposition to the TPP among Americans is so strong that at a rally on Nov 17 by Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters near Capitol Hill, many held anti-TPP plaques and claimed that it was Sanders' movement that has brought an end to TPP.  There is no reason for China and the US not to pursue a win-win game that will benefit both peoples. At the 27th China-US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade held in Washington this week, Vice-Premier Wang Yang, US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, US Trade Representative Michael Forman and US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and other officials all spoke of the rapid growth in bilateral trade and investment relations and more importantly, the huge potential ahead.  People close to Trump, such as former CIA director James Woolsey Jr, have indicated that the Trump administration might join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and even the Belt and Road Initiative (the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road).  While nothing is sure. This is an encouraging signal, as it suggests that the Trump administration may be more willing to pursue win-win cooperation with China.

"No use crying over spilt milk, but oh what might have been",11/18/2016,"                              Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton greet one another as they take the stage for their first debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, US, September 26, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      There is a Chinese saying, shihou zhugeliang, which means it's easy to prophesize after an event or to be a Monday-morning quarterback, as Americans like to say.  After businessman Donald Trump won the US presidential election, pundits and TV commentators who fervently supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton started to talk about what went wrong with her campaign.  I observed the election in several places in Washington on Nov 8. A young man I talked with at a polling place near the Duke Ellington Bridge told me he came to vote for none of the candidates but to vote against all of them. Such protest voters were not a small group this year, as many Americans felt they had to choose the lesser of two evils.  In the days since the election, many Clinton supporters or anti-Trump people took to the streets to voice their opposition to the president-elect. Many still had not realized that the failure of the Clinton campaign was that she represented too much of the status quo after aligning herself with President Barack Obama.  It literally means she could not genuinely criticize many problems in US society and address the concerns of many Americans. Those problems and concerns, such as income inequality and the role of money in politics, have become so dire that Americans were angrier than ever going into this election.  In that regard, an endorsement by Obama was both a blessing and a curse for Clinton, who lost many traditional Democratic working-class districts to Trump.  The election result might have been different if Clinton had embraced some of Bernie Sanders' campaign platform after she won the Democratic primary.           "
Positive side of Trump in building China-US ties,11/11/2016,"                               US President-elect Donald Trump speaks at election night rally in Manhattan, New York, US, November 9, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      How will Donald Trump's presidency-after he assumes office on Jan 20, 2017-affect China-US relations? This question is uppermost on many people's minds a day after Republican Trump defeated former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election.  Many have taken seriously Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail over the past 16 months, such as imposing a 45 percent punitive tariff on Chinese imports and calling China a currency manipulator. This could be misleading. Trump had only talked about tariff in the early period of the campaign and not repeated it for a long while. Besides, the US business community and the Congress are not likely to approve of such mutually destructive measures. And the US Treasury Department has repeatedly said in the past year that China is not manipulating its currency.  But how seriously should we take Trump's campaign rhetoric is a problem. Past US presidential candidates have made crazy vows vis-a-vis China during their campaigns, but they forgot them quickly once elected.  Of far more importance will be Trump's words and deeds after he enters the White House. His victory speech has sent positive messages. For example, he said: ""We will deal fairly with everyone…All people and all other nations"" and ""we will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""  His speech reflects the spirit of President Xi Jinping's congratulatory message on Wednesday to Trump about no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.  During the campaign, Trump also said that he was willing to meet Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-un and improve ties with Russia. Such a tone is welcome given the US government has intervened excessively in other nations' internal affairs in the past and US leaders like to lecture others.  President Barack Obama has been regarded by some as being less interventionist. Yet his drastic increase of drone strikes and intervention in Libya have created more problems in countries and regions.  The Obama administration is also partly responsible for triggering a bad action/reaction cycle with China in East Asia and the South China Sea with its ""rebalancing to Asia-Pacific"" strategy, widely perceived to contain China's rise.  Indeed, as secretary of state, Clinton made some contributions to US-China relations, but her hawkish instinct could have further raised tensions between Beijing and Washington if elected president.  Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said last week that Clinton, if elected, has to unlearn many of her past instincts and develop new ones.  Trump's victory speech does contain encouraging messages, but he has not made a foreign policy speech, especially regarding China. It is still unknown who will become his secretary of state and national security advisor, and who will be the members of his foreign policy team.  The growing interdependence between the two largest economies and the huge potential for mutual cooperationare compelling reasons for the two countries to expand cooperation and better manage their differences.  The US needs to show more confidence in Asia-Pacific countries' wisdom and ability to solve their maritime territorial disputes through bilateral negotiations.  Many Washington pundits I talked to seem to have little confidence in Trump's ability in foreign policy, including US-China relations. I hope Trump upsets them too by demonstrating his ability to keep the relationship on a more stable and healthy track for the benefit of both countries, as well as the region and beyond.

Objectivity falls prey to need for soundbite in US election,11/4/2016,"                              Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (L) and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump arrive before the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct 9, 2016. [Photo/IC]      The 2016 US presidential election will produce a winner and a loser on Nov 8. To me, the losers will also include the US news media, which has lost its journalism objectivity in covering the race.  Recently, I was on a panel of international journalists discussing the 2016 election that was organized by the Columbia Global Centers and held in the Pulitzer Hall at Columbia University. Since I believe that journalists should be observers, not participants, I asked if the way the US news media has covered the election means the demise of objective US journalism.  Never did I expect that my words would make the headline of an article on the Columbia Journalism Review website the next day.  Bias in the news media has become obvious since before the primaries when US news outlets devoted disproportional space and time to Donald Trump, compared with 16 other Republican candidates who either withdrew or suspended their campaigns during the primaries. This was despite the fact that Trump did not score high during the initial polls compared to his rivals.  It doesn't take an expert to figure out that for many news organizations, Trump's often politically incorrect or outrageous language has been good for their ratings and readership numbers.  A study by the Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy in June found that Trump received the equivalent of $55 million in free advertising from several major news outlets, including that worth $16 million from New York Times alone. The study concluded: ""Trump is arguably the first bona fide media-created presidential nominee.""  Meanwhile, the campaigns of candidates such as Bernie Sanders, were grossly under-reported. Most US news organizations have a tradition of endorsing a particular candidate, but that should not undermine the objectivity and fairness of their reporting.  However, this is what has happened during this campaign. If you read a US newspaper or watch a US TV channel these days about the election news, you can immediately tell which candidate they have endorsed.  That means they are not informing their readers and viewers but misinforming them.  For example, the news media has shown such enthusiasm for covering and spinning Trump's lewd conversation about women recorded on video many years ago that it overshadowed the coverage of serious campaign issues such as economy, terrorism, foreign policy, gun control and immigration-the main election issues for voters according to Pew Center surveys.  On the other hand, most news outlets have not shown nearly the same kind of passion to dig into the scandal of the Democratic National Committee's treatment of Bernie Sanders when he was competing with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic ticket.  A national Quinnipiac University poll released on Oct 19 showed that 55 percent of likely voters surveyed described the media as biased against Trump, while 42 percent, mostly Democrats, said there is no media bias against him.  On election night, New York-based ProPublica, which claims to be an independent news organization of investigative journalism, will launch a nationwide network of journalists, journalism students and concerned citizens to track and report on problems that prevent people from voting.  That could also include tracking and reporting the problems of US news organizations in covering the 2016 election.

Anti-trade rhetoric in US a deep concern,10/29/2016,"                             CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY      It is surprising to see the strong protectionism sentiment propagated by the two presidential candidates in the United States, a country that has long touted itself as the champion of free trade. Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump may disagree sharply on many issues, but their protectionist and anti-trade rhetoric is quite similar.  Almost from the beginning of his electoral campaign, Trump has pledged to impose a 45-percent punitive tariff on Chinese imports, which is not only irrational, but also impossible given the possible Chinese retaliation, the strong opposition from the powerful US business community and the violation of World Trade Organization rules.  Clinton, meanwhile, has repeatedly accused Trump of outsourcing his products from 12 countries, as if everything Americans use must be made in the US. If outsourcing products globally is a crime, then Clinton is making a charge against tens of thousands of US companies. All the Fortune 500 companies, many of which have provided donations for the Clinton campaign, should be brought to justice because they are all producing goods and services in other countries including China.  What is even more ridiculous is that The Washington Post, which endorsed Clinton on Oct 13, ran a fact check last week before confirming the allegation to be true. The newspaper's ""investigative journalist"" not only found the names of the 12 countries, but also exposed ""a complete inventory"" of Trump products made overseas, from Trump shirts made in China, Bangladesh, Honduras and Vietnam, and Trump home articles manufactured in Turkey, Germany, India and Slovenia to Trump Vodka made in a distillery in the Netherlands.  That reminded me of what I discovered in the official merchandise store of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in late July. While T-shirts and mugs had ""made in USA"" markings, the labels of origin could not be found on golf balls, socks and caps. I'm not sure if they had been taken off deliberately to avoid a debate on political correctness.  What Clinton and Trump also share is their opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries.  Clinton once touted the TPP as gold standards but has made a U-turn since launching her election campaign, in a bid to win important union voters, especially after people like AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka gave a call to stop TPP.  A Pew Center survey in January this year showed that the favorable view of trade deals among Americans is down 8 percentage points since 2014. It's anybody's guess whether Clinton's U-turn helped her win people's support, as most polls show her leading nationally less than two weeks before the Nov 8 election.  The Barack Obama administration doesn't have a good track record either. A Business Insider story last year quoted Credit Suisse and Global Trade Alert, a London-based independent academic and research think tank, as saying that the US has imposed more protectionist measures than any other country since the global financial crisis in 2008.  World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde expressed deep concern recently over the anti-trade and protectionist rhetoric by the US presidential candidates.  Ironically, for the last more than three decades, that is, since China launched its reform and opening-up, the West, especially the US, had been lecturing Beijing on the merits of free trade. It appears today that China is championing globalization and free trade as the West opposes them. The G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou, East China, in early September, too, made people realize the depth of China's belief in globalization.

Abysmal global literacy of US college students,10/21/2016,"                              Chinese student Zou Minzhe answers a question in a statistics class at Orono High School in Orono, Maine, United States, on March 8, 2011. Zou has credited his year at the school with helping him get accepted to five US colleges. Robert F Bukaty / for China Daily       The poor global literacy of college-aged students in the United States revealed in a recent survey provides a clue to why US politicians can publicly and falsely accuse China time and again.  The global literacy survey, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Geographic Society, found that only one-quarter of the students knew that China is a country with veto power over United Nations Security Council resolutions due to its status as a permanent member of the council.  Less than half (49 percent) knew that Mandarin Chinese was spoken by the most people in the world as their primary language. And 67 percent believe China has a larger economy than the US, some-thing only true according to an IMF report comparing purchasing power. Only 29 percent think the US economy is larger.  No wonder the two US presidential candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democr at Hillary Clinton, can accuse China of currency manipulation despite the basic facts.  Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who years ago accused China of currency manipulation, is now saying that there is no currency manipulation in China and if there is, it's only positive manipulation. A US Treasury report on Oct 14 dismissed China as a currency manipulator. It instead praised China's intervention in foreign exchange markets as seeking to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have had negative consequences for the global economy.  Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass and National Geographic Society President and CEO Gary Knell collectively sighed at the significant gaps between what young people understand about today's world and what they need to know to successfully navigate and compete in it.  Only 29 percent of the respondents earned a minimal pass (66 percent correct or better). Just over 1 percent -17 of 1,203 -earned an A (91 percent or higher).  Other shocking findings included only 28 percent knew the US is bound by treaty to protect Japan if it is attacked and only 34 percent knew this about South Korea. More alarmingly, only 30 percent knew that the US Congress is the constitutional authority to declare war.           "
US no better than China on women's rights,10/14/2016,"                              Voters recite the US Pledge of Allegiance at a campaign rally in Panama City, Florida, US, October 11, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      US Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her supporters these days like to quote her words at the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 when she said ""women's rights are human rights"". The words are aimed at presenting Clinton as defender of women's rights.  Indeed, women's rights are human rights, and should be defended all the time. However, when they are used to show Clinton's courage in criticizing China on women's rights, it is simply misleading.  It is true that China, as the largest developing country, still has a long way to go to achieve total gender equality. Domestic violence, discrimination in jobs and education, and women's participation in politics are just some of the issues that need to be addressed. Yet, no one could deny that women's status in China has been greatly elevated since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.  The words of late top leader Mao Zedong that women hold up half the sky are deeply rooted in people's hearts.  For example, women accounted for 45 percent of the total employment in China in 2013 and a higher percentage of the jobs are in managerial and technical positions, according to the White Paper on Gender Equality and Women's Development in China issued by the State Council Information Office in September 2015.  The gap in education has also been narrowed. About 52.1 percent of college students and 51.6 percent of graduate students in Chinese universities are women, while women account for 36.9 percent of the doctorate students enrolled.  Life expectancy for women has also increased by 4.1 years on average from 73.3 in 2000 to 77.4 years in 2010. In Shanghai, it has increased to 85.09 years in 2015.  And in 2013, 23.4 percent of the deputies to the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, were women.  However, the fact that China was ranked by the World Economic Forum 91st of 145 countries for its gender gap in 2015 shows that while China has made great progress, much more still needs to be done.  Still, China fares better than Japan (101), South Korea (115), India (108) and Saudi Arabia (134). The fact that people have not heard Clinton or her campaign boasting of talking about women's rights in these countries, mostly US security allies, only exposes her lack of sincerity when addressing women's issues in China.  What is little known, even to most US citizens, is that a UN human rights working group admonished the United States last year for its serious concerns about women's rights in the US. The US is one of a few countries not to have ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. While more than 80 percent of countries guarantee gender equality in their constitutions, the US Constitution doesn't have such a clause.  The US is also one of the four countries and the only developed country that doesn't provided mandatory paid maternal leave. Meanwhile, maternal mortality has also doubled in the US from 7.2 deaths of mothers per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 17.8 deaths in 2011. The figure for African-American women is much higher.  In the US Congress, less than 20 percent of the seats are now taken by women.  What is worse is that nearly one-third of all female prisoners in the world are incarcerated in the US, according to the 2014 study by the International Center for Prison Studies.  People joining hands to advance the cause of women's rights is to be welcomed, but if politicians intend to try and mislead the public by attempting to cash in on their empty and biased rhetoric, it only exposes their hypocrisy.

Building healthy rhetoric in China-US ties,9/30/2016,"                             LUO JIE/CHINA DAILY      Before the first US presidential debate on Monday, quite a few American experts on China were upset that the two candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, had not talked much about the United States' broad policy toward China. They have been witness to the positive momentum in bilateral relations, yet they were troubled by the worsening strategic rivalry between the two countries.  Former US ambassador to China Winston Lord believes that even in the transition period, the president-elect should find someone very important to start talking with China in a bid to turn bilateral ties around. Orville Schell, director of the Center on US-China Relations at Asia Society, has suggested that former US president Bill Clinton take up the job if his wife is elected.        For many Chinese, the absence of China as a topic during the US presidential race may not be a bad thing, because candidates have for long used China as a bogeyman. Many still remember Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 yelling and swearing in every speech that he would label China a currency manipulator on the first day in office if he was elected president. At one Republican primary that year, Jon Huntsman, a former US ambassador to China, was made to look the least relevant for US-China relations by his opponents.  That is how toxic the US presidential race is vis-à-vis China.  On Monday, Trump literally started his debate by criticizing China, accusing it of devaluing its currency. It only proves he is totally out of touch with the real world where the yuan has been facing a downward pressure from the market.  In fact, when I asked former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and former deputy national security advisor for international economics Caroline Atkinson on Sept 22 why the US government had got it so wrong just a year ago in thinking the yuan was still grossly undervalued, they both dodged the question.  During the presidential race, candidates focus on subjects they believe will please voters instead of engaging in rational debate. This is so true for this year when both candidates are disliked. Still, there has been plenty of rational and intelligent talk among China hands on a more sensible US policy toward China after the next administration takes office.  Testifying before the US Congress on Sept 22, George Washington University professor Amitai Etzioni said China and the US have many shared and complementary interests. Whatever differences exist between the two great nations, they can and must be resolved in a peaceful manner. He suggested a grand bargain between the two countries from cyber security to the Taiwan question.  Former US ambassador to China Stapleton Roy argued last week that the Barack Obama administration has based its East Asia policy on assumptions that are outdated. He believes East Asia needs a sustained and well-informed policy from the US administration no matter who wins the presidential election in November.  And the Navy Times, a US newspaper, has reported that White House National Security Council issued a directive recently asking Pentagon officials to stop using inflammatory phrases to describe US-China relationship, such as calling it a ""great power competition"". It said that by labeling the relationship a ""great power competition"", Obama administration officials inaccurately suggest the US and China are on a collision course.  NSC Senior Director for Asian Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink neither confirmed nor denied the Navy Times report on Tuesday evening when I checked with him. If true, it is a right move toward a healthier rhetoric which the important China-US relationship deserves, different from destructive declamations like ""China should not write the rules, we should"", as Obama likes to say.

"Snowden deserves not only pardon, but also the Nobel Peace Prize",9/23/2016,"                              Edward Snowden speaks via video link during a news conference in New York City, U.S. September 14, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      In the weeks before Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama met at the Sunny-lands resort in California in June 2013, the US administration had spared little effort in portraying China as a villain in cyberspace.  The revelation made by former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden just days before the Sunnylands meeting, however, exposed the real villain to the world. It showed that whatever other countries had done in cyber surveillance was nothing compared with the gigantic scale of operations launched by the NSA, often labeled ""No Such Agency"".  For the rest of the world, Snowden is a whistleblower and a hero because he revealed the US government's secret surveillance programs across the world, whose targets included leaders of countries that are US allies. Such spying, which violates people's privacy and civil rights, often involves willing and unwilling collaboration with several major US tech companies.  In the US, the debate on whether Snowden is a hero, patriot or traitor is still a divisive issue even though his revelation compelled the US administration and Congress to correct so many mistakes. For example, the panel appointed by Obama to review NSA surveillance programs made dozens of reform recommendations. A federal appeals court ruled NSA's call-tracking program exposed by Snowden illegal. And the USA Freedom Act passed by the US Congress ended the bulk collection of phone data by the government.  In the past week, Snowden has again been in the spotlight. Oliver Stone's movie Snowden hit US theaters on Sept 16. And Snowden has sought Obama's pardon, arguing that his leak of NSA surveillance programs was ""not only morally right"" but also ""left citizens bet-ter off"".  On Sept 14, the American Civil Liberties Union launched the Pardon Snowden campaign to urge Obama to pardon Snowden. The campaign was joined by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and more than 100 legal scholars, former national security officials, business leaders, human rights activists and artists.  Most of the people who believe that Snowden is a traitor and should spend the rest of his life in prison argue that he broke an oath and put the US national security in danger. It is true that Snowden breached the trust placed in him, but he did so after finding out the US administration was involved in serious wrong doings, which is a much more serious crime than people realize. Even former US attorney general Eric Holder admitted that ""we can certainly argue about the way in which Snowden did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made"".  However, the US House Intelligence Committee unanimously signed a letter to Obama on Sept 15 not to pardon Snow-den.  Obama once said the debate triggered by Snowden ""will make us stronger"", yet it does not look like he will have the good sense to pardon Snowden before leaving the White House in January.  Both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are against granting Snowden a pardon. The only 2016 presidential candidate who supported Snowden is no longer in the race. Democrat Bernie Sanders said, ""the information dis-closed by Snowden has allowed Congress and the American people to understand the degree to which the NSA has abused its authority and violated our constitutional rights"".  For the third year in a row, Snowden has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Whoever wins the prize on Oct 7, it is clear that Snowden has done the world a great service, so much more than Obama had when he was awarded the prize in 2009.

Western journalists lose objectivity by focusing on trivialities,9/9/2016,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) members, some guest countries and international organizations pose for a group photo ahead of the opening ceremony of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province, Sept 4, 2016.[Photo/Xinhua]      For some Western journalists covering the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, early this week, the biggest story was the US President Barack Obama's staircase episode at Hangzhou airport or about the few reporters who could not get close to Obama to get on-the-spot comments.  Although Obama told the news media not to ""over-crank"" the significance of the issue, for days, some mainstream US media outlets have been speculating that the Chinese must have ""plotted"" the episode to humiliate Obama.  It reminded one of some major US media outlets' reports in November 2009 saying Obama had not been treated well by the Chinese during his first visit there. White House officials strongly disagreed. Jeffrey Bader, then senior advisor for Asia in the White House National Security Council who had accompanied Obama on the trip, said the media outlets did not correctly characterize the visit.  Some Western media organizations' obsession with the staircase episode shows how they are easily distracted by minor events and thus fail to focus on the main issues.  In Hangzhou, some Western reporters spent far more time writing and dramatizing the staircase story than covering important global challenges such as a slowing world economy, climate change, poverty, trade protectionism and international governance, issues that world leaders had assembled to resolve and issues that journalists should have delved deep into if they were in Hangzhou to cover the G20 Summit, and not to act like paparazzi.  People watching US TV this past year got just one piece of news-the 2016 US presidential election. The news media seem to have decided that that is the only thing Americans need to know and care about at least until the election on Nov 8.           "
China can help fix US crumbling infrastructure,9/1/2016,"                              In this photo taken Nov 15, 2015, a passengers points to the subway map at the Union Station Metro Station, part of the public transit network for Washington.[Photo/IC]      I was rushing to catch my train in Union Station in Washington last Wednesday when I tripped over an uneven piece of pavement on the platform and hurt my ankle, only slightly. Exiting New York's Penn Station a few hours later on Seventh Avenue, I saw the exact same thing happen to a woman, only she looked much worse off than me and had to lean on her husband to walk.  A day later, a Chinese friend who visited the US for the first time was shocked to see the poor road conditions in Manhattan. The potholes in New York City far outnumber those in Shanghai or Beijing, she said. She could not understand why the Big Apple has done nothing or so little given that the 71st session of the UN General Assembly will be held in September, with the arrival of more than 100 world leaders.  In China, it would have been a total facelift like people saw ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the 2010 Shanghai World Expo and the 2016 G20 summit in Hangzhou.  New York City, often ranked top among world cities, unfortunately also ranks sixth among the 10 US cities with the worst pothole problems. Other cities that made into the top 10 include Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Milwaukee, Bridgeport (Connecticut), Tucson, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco and Los Angeles, with LA being the worst.  A report released in January by TRIP, a Washington-based national transportation research group, rated 51 percent of the roads in the New York City metro area in poor condition, 31 percent mediocre and only 5 percent and 13 percent in fair and good condition, respectively.  Nationwide, potholes cost American drivers $6.4 billion each year, according to another report. The American Society of Civil Engineers says that fixing crumbling infrastructure would cost taxpayers $2.7 trillion. The same group gave a D+ to the overall US infrastructure conditions back in 2013 in a study conducted once every four years.           "
US should rethink its foreign policy and show restraint,8/26/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton appear onstage together after his speech on the third night at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US, July 27, 2016. [Photo/VCG]      When Barack Obama was first elected US president, many expected he would carry out a foreign policy that was less interventionist than his predecessor George W. Bush who ordered the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.  That has been mostly true. But Obama's intervention in Libya in 2011 to remove Muammar Gadhafi, the bombing of Syria without the invitation of its legitimate government and the arming of Syrian rebels, and his drastic escalation of drone strikes in other sovereign nations have made his foreign policy less distinct from that of the Bush administration.              Even Obama admitted that US intervention in the Mideast had failed miserably in an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic magazine early this year.  Those in the US who now oppose military intervention on foreign soil are largely influenced by the 7,000 deaths and more than 50,000 injuries of US soldiers and the trillions of dollars of tax payers' money. Few seem to care about the much higher human and economic costs on the countries concerned, not to mention the pro-longed psychological trauma among the local populations.  However, it might be unfair to blame the US public for this because major TV net-works don't cover the conflict zones much, especially ground scenes after US bombing. People get far more news about Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria by watching CCTV, BBC, RT, France 24 or NHK.  When US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton begin their first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Sept 26, foreign policy is unlikely to be a major focus. Economy, immigration policy and other domestic issues and even their personalities will get more time.  However, there is deep concern inside and outside the US about Clinton's hawkish track record. She has supported almost all the recent US wars, and as secretary of state, she was the one behind the regime change in Libya. One US foreign policy expert I met on Wednesday described her as ""more hawkish than most people in DC"".  While disapproving of Clinton, he won't endorse Trump either, calling him isolationist.  That is probably not isolationist in dictionary meaning, but relative to the excessive US interventionism in the past decades.  Trump might be less hawkish than Clinton if elected because he is a businessman and not an ideologue. For a businessman, there is usually a deal to be made and a solution to be found.  Concerned about both Trump and Clinton, a group of scholars at Cato Institute believe the US needs a major foreign policy change to alter the bipartisan consensus that the US is an indispensable nation.  The experts contend that while the end of Cold War ushered in a unipolar world, which suggested US foreign policy would be easier to manage, events in the last 15 years have proved otherwise.  In their report, Our Foreign Policy Choices: Rethinking America's Global Role, the experts believe that the US cannot rely on business-as-usual foreign policy but must seek alternative approaches that better suit the complexities of the 21st century.  The report criticizes the current US grand strategy, known as liberal hegemony, as it demands a massive, forward military deployment. They argue such a strategy tempts policymakers to use force even when vital US interests are not threatened.  For Christopher Preble, vice-president for defense and foreign policy studies at Cato and one of the authors of the report, the ability to act does not translate into the ability to solve problems.

Century of humiliation still cuts deep into the collective psyche,8/19/2016,"                      In recent years, African-Americans have taken to the streets across US cities following the fatal shootings or other brutality against black people by police officers. Marches organized by the Black Lives Matter movement were quite noticeable during the recent 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25-28.  It may be hard for people to understand the reaction or overreaction of African-Americans if they haven't studied the history of slavery and racial discrimination in the United States. Likewise, it is impossible to correctly interpret the action, reaction and overreaction of Chinese if people haven't studied that part of its history it calls the ""century of humiliation"".  Although the situation today is entirely different from the 17th and early 18th century or even the 1960s, it cannot mask the fact that African-Americans still face discrimination, as evidenced by the low income and poor education in their communities and the much higher incarceration rate than the nation's average.  To many African-Americans, the struggle for equality and against racial discrimination is far from over. That explains why they tend to overreact if certain words and deeds remind them of the bitter history of slavery.  The National Museum of African American History and Culture, set to open on Sept 24 in the National Mall in Washington, will help people better understand that mentality.  For many Chinese, the ""century of humiliation"" started with the First Opium War (1840-1842) and lasted until 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded.  After defeating China in the First Opium War, the British forced the Treaty of Nanking on China. Under the treaty, China ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain and opened treaty ports. A subsequent treaty granted British extraterritoriality, meaning British were immune from the punishment of Chinese laws. Such unequal treaties were later imposed on China by other Western powers.  The Second Opium War (1856-1860) allowed the British to force more opium trade on China and opened more treaty ports. The looting and burning in 1860 of the Old Summer Palace, known to Chinese as Yuanming Yuan, by British and French troops left indelible marks on the Chinese collective memory.  Likewise, the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). China, which was defeated, was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki in which China ceded Taiwan and part of the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. China was also forced to pay a huge war indemnity that was several times Japan's GDP at the time.  While China was among the victors of World War I, the German concessions on Shandong peninsula were transferred to Japan as a result of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, instead of returning to China.  This Monday, Aug 15, marked the 71st anniversary of the Japanese surrender in WWII. The Japanese invasion of China caused the deaths and injuries of some 35 million Chinese, including the 300,000 unarmed Chinese soldiers and civilians in the Nanjing Massacre.  That was why when Chairman Mao Zedong declared in 1949 that the Chinese people have stood up it resonated so strongly with Chinese who remembered the bullying by Western powers.  Unlike the US, whose history in the last 150 years has been seizing land and expanding territory, for China, it has been a bitter memory of that ""century of humiliation"".  That explains why Chinese took to the streets to protest against the US following the EP-3 spy plane collision in 2001 and the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, and that is also why Chinese took to the streets when the Japanese government in 2012 nationalized the Diaoyu Islands, territory belongs to China.

Obama's fear-China strategy reveals his deceptive mind,8/12/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama holds a news conference at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, US August 4, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      US presidential candidates may be forgiven for talking nonsense in a bid to win more votes, but President Barack Obama doing so is simply irresponsible.  Obama has been talking nonsense in his desperate effort to push the Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement amid widespread public opposition. Past trade deals, such as the North America Free Trade Agreement, are blamed for costing US jobs and hurting communities. The public resentment over the TPP is so strong that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has made a U-turn on it, from calling it gold standard to opposing it. Protesters against the TPP were a major presence both inside and outside the Democratic National Convention arena in Philadelphia two weeks ago. Many Democrat Congressmen have also found opposing the TPP is the correct political line for them to be reelected this fall.  At a joint press conference with visiting Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Aug 2, Obama was asked about the challenge of getting the TPP ratified during the ""lame-duck"" session.  It is true the TPP may benefit US corporations, but Obama has not made a convincing case that it is good for the US workers who might risk losing their jobs. The US government, including during the past more than seven years under Obama, has done a poor job of adopting measures to minimize that impact. But instead of addressing the real concern of US workers, Obama seems to believe that spreading fear against China is a more effective way to achieve his goal.  So with Lee standing to his right, Obama told the press conference that, ""if we don't establish strong rules, norms for how trade and commerce are conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, then China will,"" adding that ""they are sure not worried about labor standards, or environmental standards, or human trafficking, or anti-corruption measures"".  While Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump exhibit to the full their skills of slandering each other on the campaign trail, Obama has shown that he is no less a pro.  Corruption is a serious problem in China, but President Xi Jinping has launched the strongest and most popular anti-corruption campaign. The country's new labor law also provides much better protection for ordinary workers. Indeed, China has become a global leader in fighting climate change and has played a vital role in the Paris climate agreement.  Human trafficking, albeit illegal under law, is still a thorny issue in China. But to say China is not worried about human trafficking is just as absurd a lie as saying China does not care about labor, environmental standards and corruption.  The US president so desperately wants to leave the TPP as his legacy that he is willing to say and do anything no matter how despicable they are. Despite the State Department's annual human trafficking report pointing the finger at every other country except the US, human trafficking, a modern form of slavery, is a serious problem facing that country, especially in the southern states of California and Texas.  The US Justice Department estimates that 17,500 people are trafficked into the US each year, but the real number is believed to be higher. The figure for labor and sex trafficking is also astonishing. An article by Priscilla Alvarez in the Feb 23 Atlantic monthly magazine detailed how sex trafficking goes rampantly unnoticed in the US.  On corruption, the Gallup poll released in September 2015 is the best evidence. It shows that 75 percent of Americans perceived corruption as widespread in their country's government. The figure is up from 66 percent in 2009, the year Obama took office.  When more Americans have become aware of their politicians' superb skills of spreading fear, especially in this election season, Obama's deception is most likely to prove futile.

Scrutinize US air strikes more closely,8/5/2016,"                              US officials say two F-15 aircraft launched an airstrike against the Islamic State’s leader in Libya. [Photo/Agencies]      Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook issued a statement on Monday saying that on the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord, the US military conducted precision air strikes against Islamic State group targets in Sirte, Libya. He said Monday's action and those taken previously will help prevent the IS group from gaining a haven in Libya from which it could attack the United States and its allies.                    The words seem carefully chosen to show that the US actions were not uninvited but ""at the request of the Libyan"" government, and that the air strikes were precise. But actually they reveal the problems with US air strikes, manned or unmanned.  The US has launched many air strikes in other countries without their governments' requests, even against their strong opposition. For example, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said US-led air strikes in al-Ghandour near Manbij, Syria, on July 28, killed at least 28 civilians, including seven children.  That attack took place just a day after the US announced a formal probe into the air strikes by the US-led coalition in the same area that might have left many civilians dead. According to Airwars, a non-profit project that monitors air strikes in Iraq and Syria, between 78 and 203 civilians were killed in suspected US raids on July 19. It seems the decisions to launch air strikes have been made at random. The US military does not look to have much clue about whom it targets while dropping the bombs and whom it kills and maims.  On July 28, the US Central Command said six separate US air strikes in Syria and Iraq from July 28, 2015, to April 29, 2016, caused 14 civilian deaths. A month ago, the White House had said in a report that from Jan 20, 2009, to Dec 31, 2015, the US had carried out 473 drone strikes outside of ""areas of active hostilities"", killing between 2,372 and 2,581 combatants and 64 to 115 civilians.  Yet both reports are widely regarded as grossly underestimating civilian casualties. Airwars figures show that between 773 and 1,180 civilians have reportedly been killed in the US-led coalition's air strikes in Syria since August 2014.  This heartbreaking news, sadly, has not hit the headlines of US mainstream media; some outlets covered it, though. While CNN America calls everything breaking news, it has not treated the deaths of civilians in US air strikes as one, at least not in my memory. Instead, most American cable networks cover 24x7 a shooting in a US city even if one person is killed.  The Pentagon, of course, is known for tightening the rules, making it more difficult for journalists to cover US military activities. And US leaders have not apologized or offered compensation for such civilian casualties. The only exception was when the US Air Force AC-130U gunship fired at a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Afghanistan on Oct 3, 2015, killing 42 people and leaving 30 wounded. US President Barack Obama offered a rare apology as the international medical organization called the US action a ""war crime.""  Most US citizens don't have any idea of the alarming number of civilian casualties caused by US air strikes. At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week, protesters held exhibits outside the City Hall, calling for a halt to US drone attacks. The protesters singled out Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as being responsible for those air strikes and for causing the mess in Libya.  The US not only needs to show more transparency about its air strikes and let the world know the civilian casualties. It also needs to show courage to apologize to and compensate families of innocent people killed or injured.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US voters have to decide who is the lesser of two evils,7/29/2016,"                              Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (L) and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump are seen in a combination of file photos taken in Henderson, Nevada, February 13, 2016 (L) and Phoenix, Arizona, July 11, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      People entering the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia these past days for the 2016 Democratic National Convention have been first greeted by goods on display in an official merchandise store. The most eye-catching is a poster of the party's nominee Hillary Clinton, looking 20 years younger and with red and gold rays radiating from her.  Each day from 3 or 4 pm on, the speakers talked about how great Clinton has been in fighting for the American people in everything from women's rights, social and racial equality, education, healthcare and national security, and how evil Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is in everything he represents.  In between the speeches, short video clips were played eulogizing Clinton and mocking Trump, triggering a frenzy of applause and laughter from the audience. The mood smacks of a cult of personality.  Yet the bid to present party unity and widespread support for Clinton has been interrupted from time to time by shouts of protests from supporters of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  There have been other ""conventions"" ¬outside the arena in the FDR Park and outside City Hall. Tens of thousands of supporters of Sanders and Green Party candidate Jill Stein have braved the heat to stage protests every day, portraying a Clinton that is starkly different from the one depicted inside the arena.  The debates on the street are far more exciting and thought-provoking than the speeches delivered in Wells Fargo Center.  For example, there has been no talk inside the arena about the Democratic National Committee staffers working in favor of Clinton and against Sanders, including efforts to manipulate US news media to disadvantage Sanders.

Some still can't see the wood for the trees in Sino-US ties,7/22/2016,"                              Former State councilor Dai Bingguo delivers a speech at China-US Dialogue on South China Sea between Chinese and US think tanks on July 5 in Washington. Photo by Ji Tao/China Daily      It's no exaggeration to say China-US relations have in recent times been hijacked by the South China Sea issue, at least in the headlines. Some Chinese and US think tank experts I talked with blamed the media for making the situation worse by portraying a picture very different from reality. Despite being a journalist, I agree with them even though a few think tanks in Washington have also fanned the flames for their ulterior motives. In Washington, many people know exactly which ones I mean.  Indeed, many people fail to see the wood for the trees in the hugely consequential Sino-US relationship. Many aspects of that relationship hardly make headlines, especially in the mainstream US media. It's just like the way they have been covering the 2016 US presidential election.  Last Friday, I attended a breakfast meeting of the US-China Strong Foundation, which re-branded itself just a month ago from the original 100,000 Strong Foundation. After accomplishing its early goal of sending 100,000 US students to China, an initiative taken by US President Barack Obama in 2009 and fully supported by the Chinese government, the foundation is now expanding its mission, which includes the 1 Million Strong-to help increase the number of US K-12 students learning Mandarin to 1 million by 2020 from the present 200,000. This ambitious initiative was also proposed by Obama during President Xi Jinping's state visit to Washington last September.  Travis Tanner, president of the foundation, is actually in Beijing now and will be based at its China office. CEO Carola McGiffert and her small team are all amazing people. I had a chat with Morgan Jones, its chief operation officer, in Shanghai dialect. Hannah Kerne, the associate director of programs and communications, spent three years in China, during which she also taught students in rural Yunnan province.  More exciting is their passion for the cause of investing in a new generation of leaders who have the knowledge and skills to engage with China. Such a generation would not be easily misled by sensational headlines and presidential campaign rhetoric when it comes to China-US relations.  On Friday evening, I attended a reception at the Chinese embassy in Washington to mark the 60th anniversary of Sister Cities International, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that was set up under the citizen diplomacy initiative of former US president Dwight Eisenhower. The 400 participants from dozens of countries were enthusiastic about the sister-city relationship.  President Xi is a prominent member of that group, as Mary Kane, president and CEO of SCI, noted that Xi first visited the US in 1985 as part of an agriculture research group to Muscatine, Iowa, under a sister-city relationship between Iowa and Hebei province.  Xi revisited Iowa in 2012 as vice-president and he went to Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington, a sister city of Fuzhou, Southeast China's Fujian province, last September as China's president. Xi worked as Party secretary of Fuzhou in the early 1990s and later as governor of Fujian province.  Chinese cities and provinces have sibling relationships with 258 US cities and states. The China-US relationship at the sub-national level certainly looks healthy and exciting. More US governors and mayors are embarking on regular trips to China, a major trade partner and growing investor form any US cities and states. The 300,000 Chinese students studying in US colleges and universities and the 2.67 million Chinese who visited the US in 2015 thanks to a bilateral visa extension program in late 2014 have injected positive momentum to the relationship.  This is just a one small part of the positive side of the China-US relationship. It is a pity then that many people still can't see the wood for the trees in this relationship.

Nations ill-advised to spend more to boost military power,7/15/2016,"                                   The Nimitz-class aircraft carriers USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) and USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) conduct dual aircraft carrier strike group operations in the South China Sea on June 18, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      At the South China Sea conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on Tuesday, one panel talked about military modernization and capacity building. The talk centered on China's military modernization and how that power might be projected in the South China Sea and how countries in the region should beef up their militaries to counter a possible China threat.  It's not unusual for some in the United States to sound threatened looking at China's military modernization, citing advances from command structure and submarines to bombers and fighter jets. Using the same logic, Chinese should feel even more scared given the unrivalled US military might, whether in terms of weaponry, the more than 1,000 military bases and installations across the world or the constant wars it has been fighting.  Still, that does not mean the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, should approve a 100-percent increase in defense spending to narrow this gap even though the US has been flexing its muscles near China's shores in both the South and East China seas. These include the provocative frequent surveillance by US military vessels and spy planes and the dispatch of aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the region.  The panel discussion in Washington sounded much like a business promotion for the US military industry, which has increased its sales in Asia dramatically in recent years.  The South China Sea is already highly militarized, crowded with military vessels, jets, bombers and aircraft carriers. Cajoling countries around it into buying more new or outdated US weaponry will make the region more militarized. It certainly does not look like a good way of sustaining peace and stability.  The US rhetoric portrays China as an aggressive nation, yet it has had only a brief border war with Vietnam in 1979 in the past 50 years. Yet it is difficult to tell the last time the US was not fighting a war. Deadly suicide bombings in Iraq, as a result of the 2003 US-led invasion on the false pretext of finding weapons of mass destruction, continue to this day, not to mention the countless Iraqi civilian casualty over the years.  The growing US military presence in the South China Sea has been a source of tension between China and the US. Just on Tuesday, Daniel Kritenbrink, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said the US is regularly exercising its own military capacity in the South China Sea.  The panel at the Washington conference, however, did not mention countries there, especially China, should speed up their military modernization and capacity building to tackle the US challenge. World Bank data show that China's military spending accounted for only 2 percent of its GDP in 2015, lower than the world's average of 2.3 percent and much lower than the 3.3 percent by the United States, whose monstrous military budget of some $600 billion in 2015 dwarfed that of the next 10 countries combined.  It would, however, be a bad idea for China to try to catch up with the US in this regard. That money could be far better spent to improve people's livelihoods-for example by building better schools and more hospitals. Countries around the South China Sea, mostly developing nations, share the same urgency to spend more on economic and social development, rather than on importing US weaponry.  Indeed, the US, the largest developed nation, shares no less urgency in investing in infrastructure and school systems but it still prefers to build and sell expensive military jets and other killing machines to other countries because it seems indifferent even to the hardships of its own people.

Military-to-military exchanges key to better Sino-US trust,7/8/2016,"                              Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Naval sailor aboard the Hengshui hoists the Chinese Flag after arriving at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam to participate in the multi-national military exercise RIMPAC in Honolulu, Hawaii, June 29, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]            A fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy is participating in the ongoing Rim of the Pacific Exercise even as much of the media attention remains focused on the South China Sea. In the US Congress some voices were raised not to invite China to this year's Rimpac because of the tensions in the South China Sea, but that argument was rejected by most. Among those who have rejected the argument is Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, who made his stand clear while speaking at the opening press conference of Rimpac 2016 at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday.  And at a talk held by the National Committee on US-China Relations earlier this year, four former US defense secretaries, Harold Brown, William Perry, William Cohen and Chuck Hagel endorsed more military-to-military exchanges between China and the US.  For long, Sino-US military-to-military relationship has been a weak aspect of overall bilateral ties. But that started to change after top Chinese and US leaders pledged to promote exchange and cooperation between their militaries. Despite some unresolved issues, many have called the military-to-military ties a bright spot in the overall bilateral relationship.  A PLA Navy fleet took part in the Rimpac for the first time in 2014. This year, China has sent five ships, three helicopters, a marine and diving squad each, and 1,200 officers and soldiers to the biennial military drill. The crew size is smaller than that of only the US and Canada, reflecting China's determination to cooperate with other countries to ensure maritime peace.  After covering the opening part of Rimpac 2016 at Pearl Harbor the past week, I more strongly believe that such drills will help China and the US, and indeed the 26 participating navies, better understand each other and help reduce the possibility of conflict.  Over the past years, the Chinese and US militaries have also exchanged high-level visits, including those of defense chiefs, and the PLA Navy has made quite a few port calls to the US, including to Florida last November. During the PLA Navy's first port call to the US' East Coast, the engagement between Chinese and US navy officers, as I witnessed in Jacksonville, Florida, was more than friendly. Also, Chinese and US navy chiefs have set up regular videoconferencing calls, and US Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson and PLA Navy Commander-in-Chief Wu Shengli have talked three times in the past year.  At the China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to actively implement the two memorandums of understanding on ""Confidence Building Measures"", namely the notification of major military activities and rules of behavior for safety of air and maritime encounters. The two sides have also agreed to take measures to reduce risks and deepen practical cooperation to boost mutual trust.  When senior military leaders as well as lower-level officers get to know each other better and build personal relationships, they are less likely to give orders to shoot at each other in the sea or air. Unfortunately, US laws still impose strict restrictions on broader and deeper military-to-military exchanges and cooperation with China.  Lyle Goldstein, an associate professor at the US Naval War College, asked me why his school doesn't have a single student from the Chinese mainland, although, in his view, it should have had five to 10 of them, especially because every other country seems to have a student or two. It is true that China and the US will continue to disagree on certain issues. It is also true that tension in some regions, including the South China Sea, may continue for some time. But it is only through more bilateral exchanges, not less, that the two countries and militaries will be able to manage their differences more effectively.

Progress in LGBT civil rights should be contagious,7/1/2016,"                              A couple at a group wedding for seven same-sex couples from China, in West Hollywood, California, United States, June 9, 2015. [Photo/VCG]      It was a year ago, on June 26, 2015, to be precise, when the US Supreme Court ruled that all states should issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages in other jurisdictions.  So much has changed since my stay in Hawaii in the early 1990s, when that state tried to become the first in the US to legalize same-sex marriage. It became a reality in the Rainbow State only in 2013. On June 24, US President Barack Obama designated the Stonewall Inn in New York City as a national monument to commemorate the uprising of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community on June 28, 1969. The protest that day in response to a police raid ushered in the LGBT civil rights movement.  Late at night on July 24, 2011, I was outside the Stonewall Inn 2011 to cover the celebration when the New York state legislature passed the Marriage Equality Act, signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo the same day. June is a month of Pride parades and festivals, but this year celebrations are heavy with sadness because of the June 12 shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people were killed and 53 injured.  In Shanghai, the 10-day eighth Shanghai Pride festival ended on June 26.While the Shanghai festival still did not have a parade like many other global cities, the colorful activities this year featured a film festival, stage performances, Pride run, bicycle ride, exhibitions, a conference, awareness campaign, parties and awards. Shanghai is regarded the most LGBT-friendly city on the Chinese mainland, demonstrating the tolerance and acceptance that is required for an international city that Shanghai aspires to become.  I happened to be on the China Daily team writing editorials back in 2009 when the piece ""Pride of Tolerance"" I wrote was probably the first endorsement by a national newspaper. The first Shanghai Pride festival that year was not as smooth as this year's. Some activities had to be canceled because government authorities intervened.  The attitude toward the LGBT community in China has improved over the years, but it still cannot be compared with that in the US and many other countries. Same-sex marriage is still not possible in China. On April 13, two gay men lost a court case in Changsha, Hunan province, when they challenged a local civil affairs bureau that had denied them the right to marry. Both vowed to carry on the fight, though.  On June 14, a Beijing court accepted a woman's case against the Ministry of Education to revise textbooks that call homosexuality a ""psychological disorder"". It was the third attempt by the woman with the Sun Yatsen University in Guangzhou.  China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from the list of mental disorders in 2001. But less than 15 percent of LGBT people in China choose to open up, even to their close family members, according to a United Nations report published on May 17. The study, conducted by UN Development Programme in China, Peking University's sociology department and Beijing LGBT Center, covered 28,000 people in late 2015.  The study found that young people in China were less prejudiced against the group, a good sign for more progress in the years ahead. The LGBT group in China is believed to number between 39 million and 52 million.  Sociologist Li Yinhe has been the leading voice for LGBT rights in China. For years, she has helped draft measures for the country's legislature that push for legalizing same-sex marriage. While such bills have not made any legislative progress, Li is optimistic that progress outside China will have a positive impact on the country. Perhaps she is right, for some Chinese-language media outlets covering the 2016 Shanghai Pride cited the long fight in the US, starting with the Stonewall Uprising 47 years ago.

"Money killing govt of the people, by the people, for the people",6/24/2016,"                              Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (L) looks on as Trump speaks about the results of the Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois and Missouri primary elections during a news conference held at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, US, March 15, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      The breaking news in the United States these past days has been that the Donald Trump's campaign had only $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of May, in stark contrast to the $42 million held by his rival Hillary Clinton's campaign.  Compared to the $28 million raised by Democratic front runner Clinton in May, Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate, took in a meager $3.1 million that month.  Many have been shocked by Trump's inability to raise funds at a time when the Republican National Committee has not fully thrown its weight behind him. The New York real estate mogul has been self-funding his campaign during most of the primaries, despite reports suggesting that some of the money has been used to pay his own companies.  Many people are waiting to see whether such a large fund raising gap will be narrowed in the months leading up to the November election. This, however, over-looks a key issue, the influence of money in politics, which is widely regarded as a cancer in US politics today.  Clinton does look to be bullish and powerful in fund raising. The latest report shows that she will soon tap into President Obama's email list that helped Obama's campaign rake in some $500 million through email and online donations in the 2012 race.  Just on Monday, Clinton attended a fundraiser in New York City attended by Hollywood stars such as LeonardoDiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Obama, who has complained about money in politics, has also been criticized for doing nothing about it during his presidency. He will soon spend much time hitting the campaign trails to raise money and support for Clinton.  The mania in the US for political fundraising has worsened since the 2010 Supreme Court decision on the Citizens United case which opened the floodgates to unlimited campaign finance, much of it in the form of super political action committees that pool campaign funds for or against candidates or proposed legislation.  According to the data released by the Federal Election Commission on May 23, Clinton had raised some $85 million while her super PACs amounted to $229 million, compared with $3.3 million and $63 million for Trump. Trump this week has accused Clinton of raising ""blood money"" from Wall Street.  Sadly, Bernie Sanders, the only candidate who has constantly taken on the campaign finance system head on in each and every rally, will not be his party's nominee.  Sanders called the campaign finance system ""corrupt and increasingly con-trolled by billionaires and special interests. ""I fear very much that, in fact, government of the people, by the people, and for the people is beginning to perish in the United States of America,"" he said.  Many Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, are deeply concerned about the problem. A Pew Center poll released last December found that 76 percent in both camps believe money has greater influence on politics today than ever before, while over 60 percent believe the high cost of presidential campaigns dis-courages good candidates.  Such public grievances are also reflected in a Gallup poll early this month that found a very low percentage of Americans have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" confidence in their institutions, including the presidency, Congress, the criminal justice system, the media, and big business.  And it is ironic that in the self-pro-claimed greatest democracy in the world, because of money a large percentage of Americans will be forced to make a brutal choice between lesser of two evils in electing their president in November.

Confrontational and zero-sum mindset harms relations,6/18/2016,"                      Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the US presidential election, has been busy talking about national security by mostly mocking her Republican rival Donald Trump in a manner akin to late-night talk show hosts.   Like all politicians who like to take credit but not the blame, she said early this month: ""I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen."" Yet this is a credit she certainly doesn't deserve.   China's strong resolve to fight pollution and climate change is not a result of outside pressure, but the desire of its people. In Washington last week, Nick Stern, chair of Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, praised China for being a global leader in the fight against climate change and for its ambitious goals in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20).   Clinton loves to tout her experience. This time she said: ""I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the president (Barack Obama) on some of the toughest choices he faced."" What she did not say is that she was directly responsible for some of the worst decisions, such as the regime change in Libya in 2011. Libya is in total chaos today and has become a haven for Islamic State terrorists largely because of US intervention. And the IS group is largely a by-product of the US' invasion of Iraq, which Clinton endorsed as a New York senator.     It is worth noting that China, despite being accused of all sorts of things by US politicians like Clinton, has never done anything even remotely as damaging to peace and stability in a country or region.   Her rhetoric reflects Cold War and zero-sum mentality. She claims Moscow and Beijing are ""deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them"". But she conveniently avoids saying that China by principle is a non-aligned country and the US alliances are a legacy of the Cold War.   A group of scholars at a program in Washington on Wednesday rightly condemned such alliances, saying they had emboldened the US allies to take provocative actions in the belief that Washington would always come to their help regardless of what they have done.   Clinton also claims that if the US doesn't lead the world, there will either be chaos or other countries will rush in to fill the void, and the choices they make will not be to the benefit of the US.   Does she really believe the world will come to an end without US supremacy? Or does that suggest her ""presidency"" will be one of total US global dominance, leaving no room for the rise of countries such as China, Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia?   Such mentality is the most likely reason why the US has been engaged in constant wars. Scholars say the US has been at war 93 percent of the time since its founding in 1776. That is literally 222 out of 239 years, meaning the US has been at peace for only 17 years.   It is true that most researchers on China-US relations are worried by the lack of strategic trust between China, a rising power, and the US, the only superpower. But is China to blame for that?   Confrontational speeches by Clinton are well known. But she dived deeper into the rhetoric abyss when she screamed, ""countries like Russia and China often work against us"". Such rhetoric does not suit someone who aspires to be the US president, especially because she knows full well China is not the villain and which country is. Or, is she trying to reinforce Americans' misunderstanding about China with a definite purpose?   No one knows exactly how the US presidential election will play out, but whoever gets elected in November should do better to abandon the Cold War and zero-sum mentality and pursue a path of win-win cooperation with China.

Positive ties with China would be good legacy for Obama,6/3/2016,"                              US foreign policy and economic chiefs (Left) and their Chinese counterparts sit for the sixth annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two countries at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing on July 9, 2014. [Photo/IC]      The eighth China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing on June 6 to 7 will be a great opportunity to show not just the next US administration, but also the world, that the two largest economies are expanding cooperation and effectively managing their differences.  There have been too many headlines, too much attention and obsession on a few thorny issues such as the maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea or on the issue of what the United States claims to be freedom of navigation. The action/reaction spiral that has emerged on these issues reflects a lack of effective management of the differences between the two countries, despite some positive confidence building measures on air and sea encounters.  At the S&ED, China and the US need to find away to improve their dynamic so there is a downward spiral of tensions and an upward spiral of cooperation.  It may be true that much of the US' posturing is just a show, a way for President Barack Obama to appease hawks like Senator John McCain or to show its allies in the region that the US is still a reliable security guarantor.  But the US military-industrial complex, whose influence former president Dwight Eisenhower warned of in 1961 in his farewell address, has been happy to see the upward spiral in tensions, as it has boosted US arms sales in the region.  If you go to US Congressional hearings, browse US newspaper headlines or attend seminars at think tanks in Washington, it seems that the South China Sea has become the largest issue between the two nations.  It should not be. Yet an unhealthy geopolitical mindset has prevented China-US relations from achieving their full potential, which if realized would benefit the two peoples and the world.  Robert Zoellick, the former World Bank president, noted in a May 23 talk in Washington that he sees common interests for China and the US in the Belt and Road Initiative, the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. In his view, the initiative, which will help bring stability in Central Asia, serves US interests.  Zoellick, along with people such as Larry Summers, a former top economic advisor for Obama, and Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2009 to 2013, has criticized the US response to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The four European members of the G7, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, have all joined the AIIB, while the three Pacific nations, the US, Japan and Canada, have not.  It's a surprise to see the US has not changed much on this.  A Tuesday report by Michael Fuchs and Brian Harding from the Center for American Progress recommended that the US should prioritize cooperation with China. It advised the US not to rigidly defend the status quo, citing US knee-jerk opposition to Chinese-initiated regional projects such as the AIIB.  It should be a US priority to find ways to complement China's initiatives that have the potential to enhance regional prosperity and connectivity, such as its Belt and Road Initiative, the report said.  The Obama administration is desperately trying to get Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement for the Asia-Pacific that does not include China, as part of his presidential legacy.  If leaders of the two nations really mean it when they call the bilateral relations ""the most consequential"" and ""the most important"" in the world, they need to show more wisdom and courage. A positive and strong US-China relationship would be a major legacy for Obama.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com            "
Obama leaves worrisome legacy of drone killing,5/27/2016,"                              A sailor is taking part in the fire drill on the Chinese patrol vessel ""Haixun 01"" on April 8, 2016 in the South China Sea. [Photo/Xinhua]      As US President Barack Obama completes his second term, the controversial drone strikes he has dramatically escalated will clearly be part of his legacy.  The US military claimed that it launched a drone strike on May 21 that killed Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in a western Pakistan province near the border with Afghanistan. But Pakistan's government was not informed beforehand of the strike that took place on its sovereign territory. Neither was there any information on the others blown up in the vehicle by several US drones.              The US government has been using euphemisms to describe such actions as target killings, rather than assassinations, just like the words ""enhanced interrogation"" instead of ""torture"" are used regarding Guantanamo prison detainees held without due process.  While Obama claims that the United States has been the ""standard bearer in the conduct of war"", the drone strikes have drawn sharp critic is mover their legality and the loss of civilian lives, described in White House euphemism as ""collateral damage"".  In such a situation, Obama, a lawyer by training, has been making decisions himself as who should be on the kill list. This contrasts sharply to his days as a young senator from Illinois when he criticized such a counterterrorism approach by then-President George W. Bush.  The latest book, The Assassination Complex: Inside the Government's Secret Drone Warfare Program, written by Jeremy Scahill and the staff of The Intercept and published by Simon&Schuster early this month, tells an entirely different story from the one told by Obama and other US government officials.  The book is based on the Drone Papers published by The Intercept last October with numerous secret documents by whistleblowers that detail the inner workings of the US military assassination program in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia.  Far from Obama's claims that drone strikes have been carried out with ""near certainty"", the book shows that some 90 percent of the people decimated in the strikes were not the intended targets.  It might be true that with the emergence of remote-controlled lethal weapons, the US may have saved American lives by not putting boots on the ground, but what is also true is that the cost of civilian lives in those countries from South Asia to the Middle East and North Africa has increased dramatically.  The Intercept papers and book reveal that the strikes personally ordered by Obama could often be based on an intelligence system with many loopholes, and that the US military simply labels unknown people killed in drone assassination as ""enemies killed in action"".  The publications also reveal that White House standards regarding drone strikes are confusing. For example, the White House policy standards stipulate that lethal force will be used only against targets who pose a ""continuing, imminent threat to US persons"". It does not fit the situation in Yemen and Somalia, where there was little US presence to justify such action.  The documentary National Bird, released last month, also tells the story of the horrible drone program from the viewpoint of three US whistleblowers, or three US military veterans who participated in the drone warfare but were haunted by the guilt of killing people on foreign soil, people whose faces they could not even see. The prolonged psychological horror suffered by civilian survivors of those drone strikes is also revealed in the documentary.  The White House announced in March that it will release its drone playbook and the number of casualties regarding combatants and civilians. What is clear is that the whole world is watching this legacy of Obama's, while drone technology continues to proliferate fast around the world.  Remember the panic caused in the US when a small amateur drone crash landed last October on the lawn outside the White House?

Trump's willingness to talk to the DPRK is the right approach,5/20/2016,"                              US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Century Center in South Bend, Indiana, US, May 2, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]       US Republican presumptive presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a campaign rife with political incorrectness. And on Tuesday, Trump said he would be willing to talk to Democratic People's Republic of Korea leader King Jong-un.  ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" Trump told Reuters, adding that he would ""absolutely"" try to talk some sense into the DPRK leader.  With the US government now refusing to engage directly with the DPRK, Trump's words have made major headlines in the United States. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, clearly disapproved.  China's Foreign Ministry has generally remained cool in the face of the frequent outrageous rhetoric regarding China by US presidential candidates. But spokesman Hong Lei, when asked to comment on Trump's words, said on Wednesday that China supports direct talks and communication between the US and the DPRK. ""We believe this is beneficial,"" he said.  China has been long pushing for a direct engagement between Washington and Pyongyang to defuse the growing tension on the Korean Peninsula.  The Obama administration has won praise for engaging Iran and Cuba in the past few years. But Obama has not taken the same approach with the DPRK.  In February, State Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed that the US rejected the DPRK's proposal to discuss a peace treaty to replace the 1953 Armistice agreement, citing the DPRK's lack of sincerity in dropping its nuclear program.  Instead, the US has increasingly relied on economic sanctions and shows of force, such as its frequent military drills with the Republic of Korea aimed at the DPRK, something that further justifies the DPRK's concerns for its own national security.

World not safer with the US as its policeman,5/13/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Schloss Herrenhausen in Hanover, Germany, April 24, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      When Elizabeth Trudeau, director of US State Department Press Office, read a statement on Tuesday about a US Navy surface ship ""exercising the right of innocent passage"" while transiting near China's Yongshu Reef that day, she said it was to uphold the rights and freedoms of all states under international law and to challenge the excessive maritime claims of some claimants in the South China Sea.  She was soon challenged by an Associated Press reporter about who determines what constitutes an excessive maritime claim. Trudeau, who, like most people, clearly does not understand much of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, said this is consistent with UNCLOS.  She was then reminded that the US has not ratified UNCLOS, unlike more than 160 other countries. The US' concern is that ratifying the convention would subject it to international laws that would diminish the US' sovereignty on the high seas.  Such hypocrisy aside, the US Navy action reflects the deep-rooted US mentality that it is the self-appointed world's policeman.  It was just like a CNN report earlier this week talking about Russian military presence in Syria. In the end, the reporter quoted a Syrian civilian as saying that peace and stability can only be brought about by Syrian people, not external forces, implying that the Russian forces are not helping.  Yet as anyone who does not have short memory knows too well it was the US and its NATO allies that were the first external forces to become involved in the conflict in Syria, when they supplied arms to rebel groups and when US President Barack Obama said in 2011 that Syrian President Bashar Assad must go. Since their intervention, the Syrian conflict has escalated, causing huge loss of civilian lives, an influx of refugees and the rise of the Islamic State extremist group.  Unlike his predecessors, Obama's rhetoric has been less supportive of US being the self-appointed policeman of the world. In his last State of the Union Address in January, he said, ""How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?""  However, the US' actions in Syria, Libya and now the South China Sea suggest the US still regards itself as far beyond all other nations and international organizations such as the United Nations.  Yes, the world needs a policeman, and it is debatable whether UN can effectively serve that role. But the US' track record in this regard is hardly impeccable. Throughout the past half a century, it has supported and armed many ruthless dictators from Asia to Africa to Latin America. And it has enforced international laws in favor of its security allies and partners, no matter how bad they behave.  We should not forget that both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were good friends of the US just less than three decades ago.  The fact of the matter is the world is no safer today with the US serving as the world's policeman, or in euphemism, exercising its global leadership.  I am not denying it has played a positive role at times, but the role of world's policeman clearly needs to be kept under scrutiny by the UN and the international community. Otherwise, it invites chaos if every big power appoints themselves as a global or regional policeman.  A Pew Center poll released on May 5 about America's role in the world showed that most Americans say it would be better if the US just dealt with its own problems and let other countries deal with their own problems as best they can, and more people than before say the US should cut back its defense spending.  That is a clear disapproval by American people for the US playing the role of the world's policeman.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
There are things that China can still learn from Japan,5/6/2016,"                              Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul, Nov 1, 2015. [Photo/chinadaily.com.cn]      Learning from Japan was trendy in China in the late 1970s and 1980s when the country started its reform and opening-up drive. As one of the top industrialized nations in the world, Japan had a lot to offer China, everything from management to technology to education. The Japanese economic miracle was also the envy of many Chinese.  In those days, the Japanese economy was several times larger than that of China, and Japanese tour groups were obvious on Shanghai's streets.  However, China overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy in 2010 and is on way to surpass the United States, if it has not done so already. In contrast, the Japanese economy has stagnated over the last two decades.  Learning from Japan is no longer in vogue in China despite the fact that Chinese tourists to Japan love buying Japanese products, such as electronic toilet seats and cosmetics.  The latest media reports about Japan in China have largely been about the public protests against Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government's bid to revise the Japanese Constitution, the disputes over the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, Japan's attempts to meddle in the South China Sea disputes between China and some Southeast Asian nations and the Japan-US alliance that is increasingly aimed at containing China.  So it was a bit surprising to see the Chinese version of Harvard University Professor Ezra Vogel's 1979 book Japan as No 1: Lessons for America among the bestsellers in Shanghai's bookstores.  Vogel was insightful. He wrote the book in 1979, more than a decade before Japan became the world's second-largest economy.  Vogel became a Japan hand before becoming a well-known China hand. He firmly believed the US, despite being the world's largest economy and dominant power, had a lot to learn from Japan.  That was also the message he has today for China. In the preface for the new Chinese edition, Vogel expresses concern that some of his Chinese friends feel that China has nothing more to learn from Japan now that their economy has eclipsed that of Japan.

US presidential candidates lie to win votes,4/8/2016,"                              US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Madison, Mississippi March 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      As a close observer of several US presidential elections, I have found the 2016 race bemusing in both predictable and unpredictable ways.  The most baffling is that so many Americans say they support Hillary Clinton when various polls show that the majority think she is less honest and trustworthy compared with her rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  Honesty was everything for Americans when I travelled across the United States in the summer and fall of 1998 when the only topic was the lie President Bill Clinton told about Monica Lewinsky.  What was also unforeseen was billionaire candidate Donald Trump, who seemed no more than a comedian just months ago, is still one of the Republic an front runners. But that is perhaps not that surprising given the US news media's obsession with Trump over the past months and the amount of cover age he's received.  What is entirely predictable is that China continues to be the bogeyman.  With former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's 2012 vow about naming China a currency manipulator from ""Day One"" still ringing in my ears, Clinton and Trump have both railed against China as a currency manipulator despite the fact this is less an issue than in 2012. Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers noted recently that it was a mistake for the US to push for China's exchange rate liberalization in a hope for the yuan's appreciation while market forces are pushing down the currency.  Nevertheless, US politicians like to fool average American voters, many of whom have little knowledge of the world, especially when their prime source for information is cable news networks.  Clinton and Trump talked about how the US has been ripped off by its growing economic relations with China. They are willing to say anything to please voters who lost manufacturing jobs due to globalization, and more to automation.  Clinton's back tracking on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, whose standards she called ""golden"" as secretary of state but which she now opposes so as not to offend powerful trade unions, reflects that motivation.  Yes, globalization has helped achieve the China economic miracle in the past three-plus decades, including lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty. But this can mostly be credited to the Chinese government's policy of reform and opening-up to the world.  Former US ambassador to China Stapleton Roy, whose wisdom I often admire, reminds people that trade is a form of cooperation. And few US consumers are willing to pay much more in department stores or Walmart just because something is made in USA. It's against the basic economic principles of comparative advantage.  Besides consumers, US corporations have benefitted enormously from trading with and investing in China. If US politicians are bothered by made in China, they should come to China to see the numerous US brands from GM and Ford cars to Coca-Cola and KFC.  Many Chinese would probably like the US to take back some of their investments relocated to China to take advantage of the lax environmental regime. I hope Clinton and Trump are ready to roll out red carpets for them when they return or adopt measures to make it more difficult for them to leave the US for developing nations.  In various TV ads, Clinton has boasted of her record in criticizing China's human rights, especially women's rights, but she did not mention the women's rights situation in many of the US' allies. A Newsweek/Daily Beast study in 2011 found that China ranked 23 among 165 countries and regions for women's rights, an impressive record for a developing nation.  In the categories of justice, health and education, China scored higher than the US.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
It's futile for US to blame China to cover its own misdeeds,4/1/2016,"                             MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY      It is not unusual for senior US officials to throw jabs at China in their public speeches while traveling abroad.  President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton did that when they visited Africa years ago. It happened at a time when a rising China quickly became Africa's largest trade partner and investor, especially in infrastructure, an area increasingly ignored by Western nations.  When Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel spoke at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin on March 22, he followed the same pattern-criticizing China without any self-criticism.  He pointed finger at China's human rights, laws and regulations on cyberspace, banking, counterterrorism and NGO management.  It is no secret that as a developing nation, China has a lot of room for improvement. Yet the world's only superpower has much soul searching to do, too, and it does not seem proper for senior US officials to use megaphone diplomacy against China. Chinese officials have refrained from doing things like that while traveling abroad, although they have plenty of ammunition.  For example, the rampant US drone strikes in some Middle East and North Africa nations have not only constituted violations of sovereignty, they have killed many civilians, including women and children.  The same is true for cybersecurity. The students at the Hertie School of Governance, who are from various countries, may well remember how the National Security Agency has operated above the law to conduct surveillance. Over the years, the US government has also forced tech companies to collaborate and conspire in such surveillance activities.  On March 25, Democracy Now, a small but reputable network, continued talking about how the Pentagon funded and used a Colorado-based Christian NGO as a front to spy on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Russel talked at length, criticizing China's actions in the South China Sea. He talked lightly, however, when mentioning the land reclamations, military facilities and airstrips built by other nations before China made any such moves in the past years.  ""This was not a good thing,"" Russel said, without explaining why the US remained dead quiet over the years and decades when other nations took those actions. It's just like when he conveniently forgot to mention publicly the gross human rights violations by some close US allies.  Russel repeated the US stance of not taking sides in the South China Sea sovereignty issues. He sounded like a judge when arguing for the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a treaty the US has not even ratified.  He did not say that China made the Article 298 declaration 10 years ago not to accept compulsory arbitration, a decision that also was made by some 30 other signatory nations.  The US is certainly responsible for the tension in the South China Sea when it tries to rally countries in the region to gang up on China in pursuit of its pivot-to-Asia strategy. The US sending aircraft carriers and bombers there is a clear sign of militarizing the region.  Wang Yingfan, China's former permanent representative to the UN, was blunt in his recent speech at American University. He called on the US to exercise restraint, saying, ""If you do too much, China has to react.""  Russel accused China of coercion and disrespecting international laws, saying ""the United States accepts limits"".  It is not hard to tell that the US is the country that has used coercion more frequently than any other nation. And if the rampant drone strikes, the frequent military surveillance along the Chinese coast, the regime change in Libya and the NSA's activities as revealed by Snowden are examples of accepting limits, then Russel has to define what not accepting limits is.

Obama fails to tackle main issues during Cuba visit,3/25/2016,"                              Cuba's President Raul Castro (1st L, front) bids farewell to the visiting US President Barack Obama (1st R, front) at the Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, capital of Cuba, March 22, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]      US President Barack Obama began a historic visit to Cuba on Sunday, the first by a US president in 88 years. He toured the old town in Havana known as Habana Vieja, met Cuban leader Raul Castro, delivered a speech that was televised live and watched a baseball game between US and Cuban teams, among other things.  Before the trip, the US Commerce and Treasury departments announced amendments to the US sanctions regulations on Cuba, making it slightly easier for travel, financial transactions and doing business between the two countries, which are only 144.84 kilometers from each other.  Obama should be praised for his efforts toward normalizing relations between the two countries over the past years, an effort that resulted in the reopening of their respective embassies last summer. But it was still just the start, and in fact many people had expected such progress during his first term in office, not the second term, based on his previous promises.  And while Obama deserves credit for making the trip, he has not addressed some key questions while passionately preaching so-called American values in his speech at the ornate Gran Teatro in Havana on Tuesday.  Obama said he was asking the US Congress to lift the 54-year embargo on Cuba, yet he didn't mention much about how such an embargo has caused to the sufferings of 11 million Cuban people, including women and children. He has not shown the courage to apologize for such a gross violation of the human rights of the Cuban people.  During my three trips to Cuba, the Cubans called it blockade because the embargo is so comprehensive that it has hurt Cuba and Cuban people in every aspect. It is a typical example of a big nation bullying a small nation. There is no doubt that the US is the country most obsessed with sanctioning other nations, sanctions that have repeatedly proved failures in the past.  It is sad that people still couldn't see any hope even today that such an inhuman embargo will be lifted by the US Congress anytime soon. On the contrary, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, said he would even close the newly opened embassy if elected.  While lifting the Cuban embargo still seems such a debatable issue in the US, the rest of the world has sent a clear message in the last more than two decades, with some 200 nations passing resolutions condemning the US embargo at the annual United Nations General Assembly sessions.  In his speech, Obama intentionally avoided mentioning Guantanamo Bay, the Cuban territory which the US has occupied for more than a century based on an unequal treaty. On this Cuban soil, the US maintains a large military base in the Caribbean and a notorious detention center, where detainees are held without legal trial.  In that speech, Obama said"" I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas.""  Yet there is no doubt that the embargo and Guantanamo Bay still smack of Cold War and colonialism. And they are two major obstacles for Cuba and the US to further improve their relations.  Obama seemed oblivious to this when he said, ""we (Cuba and US) both live in a new world, colonized by Europeans.""  But if Obama hopes to claim a major legacy in improving US-Cuban relations, he should fight much harder in the remaining 10 months in office to correct those US Cold War and colonial mistakes.

More to fear from a weak China than one that is strong,3/18/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama delivers a statement on Iran at the White House in Washington, January 17, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      The latest cover story in The Atlantic written by Jeffrey Goldberg is quite telling of US President Barack Obama's foreign policy.  In the article, The Obama Doctrine, Goldberg reveals that the US leader has little interest in the Middle East, which he sees as quite bleak. That, surprisingly, also includes Saudi Arabia, a US ally in the region and the largest buyer of US weapons.  Talking on CBS' Face the Nation on Monday, Goldberg described Libya as Obama's Iraq. The United States and its NATO allies pursued regime change there by abusing a 2011 UN Security Council resolution.  Asia has been viewed by Obama as the most promising region. Based on his many interviews with Obama, Goldberg said Obama has made a ""pivot to Asia"" a paramount priority and he believes US economic future lies in Asia.  According to Goldberg, Obama has been focused on rebuilding the sometimes-threadbare ties between the US and its Asian treaty partners, and he is perpetually on the hunt for opportunities to draw other Asian nations into the US' orbit.  The article gave substance to the suspicion that the US has been trying to profit from the maritime territorial disputes between China and some of its neighbors and is seeking to drive a wedge between them.  This is manifested in Obama's approach to Vietnam. And Obama administration officials repeatedly hinted to Goldberg that Vietnam may one day host a permanent US military presence.  As to what country Obama considers the greatest challenge to the US in the coming decades, Obama said ""in terms of traditional great-state relations, I do believe that the relationship between the United States and China is going to be the most critical"".He said that one possibility is a China that is on a peaceful rise, which will share with the US the burden and responsibility of maintaining the international order, while the flip side is ""not only do we see the potential for conflict with China, but we will find ourselves having more difficulty dealing with these other challenges that are going to come"".

US military power is as much of a blessing as a curse,3/12/2016,"                              A formation of the Nanhai Fleet of China's Navy on Saturday finished a three-day patrol of the Nansha islands in the South China Sea. [Photo/Xinhua]      The John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group, which includes five US naval vessels, made a high-profile appearance in the South China Sea a few days ago, angering many in China. When I asked Mark Toner, State Department deputy spokesman, on Monday whether such a move was raising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, he repeated his government's talk of the US exercising freedom of navigation rights. The US will continue to do so in accordance with international law, he added.  Common sense tells us that everything which is not forbidden is allowed. Let's assume for a moment the five-day show of the John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea was in accordance with international law. Still, it does not mean it did not escalate tensions there.  Also, it is absolutely legal for a passerby to stand and look into your house. But it will make you feel uneasy, even angry, if he/she keeps doing it every day. And he/she will drive you crazy by standing on the sidewalk outside your house for hours with a Swiss army knife in hand.  To a large extent this is what the John C. Stennis strike group did a few days ago, USS Curtis Wilbur did in January and USS Lassen did in October last year in the South China Sea. In fact, US military planes and ships have been conducting annoying surveillance operations near China's coasts for long.  That the US is in talks to base long-range bombers in Australia within striking distance of the South China Sea is the latest disturbing news raising questions about Washington's intentions. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said it well at a news conference this week: freedom of navigation does not give anyone the license to do whatever they want.  US actions are certainly militarizing the South China Sea and heightening tensions in the region. ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", a Confucian saying used in US war propaganda documentaries during World War II to describe the good nature of Chinese, is largely forgotten by today's US leaders.  If you think there is too much China-bashing already in the US, imagine what will happen if People's Liberation Army planes fly and ships sail frequently off the coasts of California, Florida and New York, or when China starts building military bases in Latin America and holds military drills in the Caribbean Sea.  With a defense budget larger than that of the next eight countries put together, a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the planet many times over and more than 800 military bases across the world, including 113 in Japan and 83 in the Republic of Korea, the US military is indeed unrivalled.  Yet among the complaints I hear in Washington is one that US politicians are easily tempted to use military solutions because of the country's strategic might. This was echoed at a talk given by Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council, on March 4. When asked about the mess in Libya and other places as a result of US military actions, Treverton admitted that the US is better at carrying out military operations than caring about the results it wants to achieve.  What it entails is that when US leaders and politicians keep boasting and advocating military superiority, they do not realize their country's military power has proved to be a blessing as much as a curse. No wonder the US has been continuously engaged in wars.  Apparently, such a mindset has also prevented many US leaders and politicians to think straight when it comes to the South China Sea.

Growing public anger reflects widespread feelings of impotence,3/4/2016,"                              A man in traditional Mexican apparel takes part in an anti-Donald Trump, pro-immigration protest in the Manhattan borough of New York December 10, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      Queuing up recently in a post office in Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C., a woman complained to me in a loud voice about the long line of customers being serviced by only one clerk. She then angrily provided a long list of what is going wrong in the United States.  Americans are known for being optimistic, but the word most often used to describe public sentiment in the US these days is ""angry"".  A number of polls in recent months have shown more Americans saying they are angry and that those that were already angry are angrier than before.  A CNN/ORC poll conducted in December revealed that 69 percent of Americans say they are either ""very angry"" or ""somewhat angry"" about ""the way things are going"" in their country.  A November survey by Esquire/NBC found that about half of the more than 3,000 American adults polled are angrier today than they were a year ago. The survey also showed whites are angrier than other ethnic groups and Republicans are angrier than Democrats.  Such anger is reflected in the 2016 presidential race where leading candidates have been scrambling to cash in on people's anger.  This week, billionaire businessman Donald Trump won seven of the 11 states on Super Tuesday by skillfully tapping into people's anger. He said in a debate in January that he would ""gladly accept the mantle of anger,"" adding ""yes, I am very, very angry"".  Tapping into people's anger has been proven so powerful for Trump that some Republican heavyweights are wondering if they still have the clout to get rid of the non-mainstream tycoon in favor of Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz.  Likewise, Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who carried four states on Super Tuesday, said ""I am angry and millions of Americans are angry."" And Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner told National Public Radio that ""I understand why people get angry"".           "
It's high time the US stopped blurting out poisonous rhetoric,2/26/2016,"                              Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct. 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]      US President Barack Obama must be desperate to push the Trans-Pacific Partnership through Congress during his remaining 10-plus months in office. ""Our concern there was that China was the 800-pound gorilla, and if we allowed them to set trade rules out there, American businesses and American workers were going to be cut out,"" Obama said at the National Governors Association reception on Monday, in response to a US trade policy question raised by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.  That was part of the scare tactics Obama has been using for at least the past two years. He has been reiterating that, ""we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules"".  Concluded on Oct 5 last year and signed on Feb 4 this year, the TPP is yet to be ratified by the legislatures of the 12 signatory countries. And it is facing stiff opposition from people across the social and political divide even in the US. In fact, many lawmakers in Obama's Democratic Party are opposed to the TPP.  Former US trade representative Rob Portman, now a Republican senator from Ohio, also opposes the trade deal. And while leading Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and their Democratic counterparts Bernie Sanders and Hillary Cliton may have huge differences on other issues, they are unanimously opposed to the TPP.  Obama, though not running for the 2016 presidential election, has never stopped talking like he is still on the campaign trail. His inflammatory campaign-like rhetoric is humiliating to the Chinese and damaging to bilateral relations, which he often describes as one of the most consequential in the 21st century.  Many ordinary Chinese would ask why their country, being the world's largest trading nation, the second-largest economy and home to one-fifth of humanity, should not be on the table in setting global rules. Isn't that discriminatory?  Governors of US states are often the most avid about boosting trade and investment ties with China. Many of them have visited China multiple times on trade missions. A US-China Business Council report shows that China was among the top three export markets for 39 US states in 2014. Another report, released by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the Rhodium Group last May, shows Chinese companies are operating in 340 of 435 US congressional districts, directly employing more than 80,000 US citizens.  There is no doubt that Obama's remarks at the governors' reception were meant to sow the seeds of misunderstanding and distrust toward China, just as he has done in his several nationwide speeches.  David Lampton, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and a noted scholar on China, says he was somewhat dismayed that Obama so frequently used words like ""we can't let China write trade rules of the 21st century"". Lampton asked at a seminar on Monday: ""Why he (Obama) said that and what's his motivation?""  Scott Kennedy, deputy director of Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes the US should stop seeing itself as protector of existing rules ""because if you look at the international system, there are lots of rules that are good, and there lots of rules that stink"". He adds that the US should stop its knee-jerk ""resistance"" to Chinese initiatives.  US politicians like Obama keep spreading canards that nothing from China is good and thus everything Chinese must be resisted. But Kennedy says maybe they're good, helpful and could help improve the system.  It's time Obama stopped pushing for the TPP at the cost of the vital China-US relations.

American Dream increasingly distant from most in US,2/19/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama makes opening remarks at a gathering with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states leaders at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California February 15, 2016.[Photo/Agencies]      US President John F. Kennedy was ambitious and idealistic in his ""moon speech"" on Sept 12, 1962, saying ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.""  However, when 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders laid out a vision for the United States to provide free college education, raise the minimum wage to $15, expand Social Security and address the widening income and wealth gap and the criminal justice system, he was labeled by his Republican and Democratic rivals as unrealistic or socialist.  Michael Moore's new documentary Where to Invade Next reminds Americans that not only have many of these ""unrealistic"" and ""socialist"" ideals become a reality in European countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, they are described by those in Scandinavia as ideas that originated in the US.  The movie struck a chord with the US audience as I watched it last weekend. Many of them applauded at the end, not to mention their laughter during the hilariously funny movie.  Long, paid vacations in Italy, a year of paid maternity leave in Scandinavia and a surprisingly cozy prison in Norway are just some of the contrasts with US society today. The US and Papua New Guinea are the only two countries that don't offer paid maternity leave.  And the Italian and Finnish employers/capitalists talk about the importance of treating their workers well and of having a society that is fair, unlike the one in the US.  Moore believes most Americans have no idea that a large chunk of the US taxpayers' money is spent on the military.  According to the White House Office of Management and Budget and the non-partisan, non-profit organization National Priorities Project, which aims to make the US budget transparent, 53.71 percent, or $598 billion, of the discretionary spending in 2015 was on the military, more than the combined spending on education, medical care and health, housing and community, energy and the environment, transportation, science, food and agriculture, veterans' benefits and government.  Ironically, most of the 2016 US presidential candidates are still arguing for more spending on the military by exaggerating threats from Russia and China, among others. To them, maintaining absolute military supremacy is more important than the wellbeing of ordinary Americans.  Having lived in New York and Washington for six years, I have always wondered why people living in New York and Washington don't complain about cellphone services being unavailable once inside the subway systems, considering communications are so vital for everyone in the 21st century.  I told my American colleague that cellphone services are available in the Shanghai or Beijing subway systems. ""Maybe Americans don't know you can have cellphone services in the subway,"" the colleague said.  US highway systems and airports used to be the envy of the world after World War II, but they have become increasingly dilapidated, especially when the rest of the world has invested heavily in infrastructure in recent decades.  At the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies last week, Larry Summers, a former chief economic advisor for President Obama, asked the audience if they feel proud as Americans of Kennedy or LaGuardia airports in New York. Many flights at Kennedy are international, and Summers asked if any of those international airports aren't nicer than Kennedy Airport.  ""And we are supposed to be the greatest and richest country on earth,"" he said.  In her 2010 book Third World America, Arianna Huffington, argued that excessive spending on war and the military at the expense of domestic issues is denying ordinary Americans the American Dream.  Moore's movie is the latest reminder that a nation that claims to be the greatest and most exceptional seems to quickly forget its ideals.

Culture can counter the spin of animosity,2/5/2016,"                              Women take a photograph inside the Thean Hou temple ahead of Lunar New Year of the monkey celebrations outside Kuala Lumpur on Feb 2, 2016 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. According to the Chinese calendar, the Lunar New Year which falls on Feb 8 this year marks the Year of the Monkey, the Chinese Lunar New Year also known as the Spring Festival is celebrated from the first day of the first month of the lunar year and ends with Lantern Festival on the Fifteenth day. [Photo/CFP]      Many Chinese living in Washington and most other US cities have long complained that they don't feel any festive mood at the Lunar New Year, which this year arrives on Monday, Feb 8. That would surely not have been the case if they visited the American Art Museum in downtown Washington on Jan 30.  The 28,000-square-feet Kogod Courtyard with its glass canopy was filled with mostly American parents and children enjoying everything from a lion dance, paper cutting, red lantern making, mask coloring, monkey figurine making and music performances with Chinese instruments such as suona (a double-reeded horn) and erhu (the Chinese two-string fiddle). It was a traditional street scene in China to greet the Lunar New Year. In just three and half hours that day, an estimated 7,300 people participated in the Family Day event to greet the Year of the Monkey.  Fast rewind to about two weeks ago when Washington was hit hard by one of the worst snowstorms in its history, the video going viral that weekend was about 18-year-old giant panda Tian Tian rolling down the slope, clearly excited, in his snow-covered yard in the Smithsonian's National Zoo.  On Jan 16, there were long lines outside the zoo's panda house when Bei Bei, a five-month-old giant panda cub, made his debut.  Such a craze for giant pandas is nothing new. At last Saturday's event, many visitors, children as well as adults, posed for photos with volunteers dressed in giant panda costumes. The premiere of Kung Fu Panda 3 in theaters across the US on Jan 29 was another testimony that the giant panda is indeed a great ambassador for China.  I would argue what was missing last Saturday in the American Art Museum courtyard was some stands selling popular Chinese snacks, such as sugar-coated haws, roasted chestnuts or even fried fermented bean curd. A major misunderstanding of Chinese food in the United States is that it's all about sweet and sour pork, General Tso's chicken and fortune cookies, things you either don't find in China or are not representative of Chinese cuisine. Many Chinese restaurants in the US serve one-sauce-for all dishes, something you don't find in China.  However, pandas and such interactions as those to celebrate the Year of the Monkey can help ordinary Americans better understand Chinese people, their culture and history. When people interact and understand each other better, it will be much more difficult for politicians and interest groups to distort the picture and spread fear.  For example, on Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in order to argue for a higher military budget for 2017, grossly exaggerated the threat of a rising China.  Such irresponsible and hawkish rhetoric may deceive some Americans who have never visited China and studied Chinese culture and history, but it will not make much sense to Americans who are well immersed in Chinese culture and want to make friends, not war, with China.  It was exciting to see those artists that had travelled all the way from central China's Henan province to the American Art Museum last Saturday. They are also visiting cities in Virginia, Maryland and other cities in North America. Christina Trifonova, an American mother with two daughters from Rockville Maryland, told me last Saturday that it's so important to learn and respect other nations' culture and history. Tome, that seems especially true in Washington to counter politicians' busy daily spin of hatred among peoples and nations by exploiting Americans' lack of understanding of other nations, their cultures and histories.

Paper misleads US by pointing to wrong place of danger,1/22/2016,"                              A warship sails in South China Sea during a Chinese navy drill in South China Sea, July 28, 2015. [Photo/CFP]      The Asia-Pacific Rebalance 2025 report unveiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Wednesday reads like a call to prepare for a war with China.  The report, commissioned by the US Congress under the National Defense Authorization Act, calls for strengthening the US' capabilities, presence and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, as if it wasn't the case, as Obama acknowledged in his State of the Union address on Jan 12, that the US is the most powerful nation on Earth, spending more on its military than the next eight nations combined.  Every suggestion the report makes is aimed mainly at China.              For example, China is the target when it calls for strengthening the capability, capacity, resilience and interoperability of the US' alliances and partnerships, forming a standing US joint task force for the Western Pacific, and encouraging Japan to establish a joint operations command. And China is the target when it calls for increasing the US' surface fleet presence, improving its undersea capabilities, continuing the diversifying of its air operating locations, bolstering regional missile defense, stockpiling critical precision munitions, developing advanced long-range missiles and augmenting its space, cyber and electronic warfare capabilities ... the list goes on.  China's growing anti-access/area denial capability, which is defensive in nature, is cited by the report as a major argument for the US to advance these capabilities. To justify its argument, China is described as a nation of ""coercion"" and a ""potential adversary"" despite the fact that China has not engaged in any military conflict for decades, except for a brief border conflict with Vietnam in 1979. The US on the other hand, has not only been constantly engaged in threat and coercion but also engaged in incessant wars.  The unpublished classified part of the report is probably even more heinous in its warmongering.  The report's short section on expanding confidence building and crisis management with China looks like an attempt at providing cover for a spokesperson for the Pentagon and the US military industry complex, given the CSIS has close ties with both.  The US' rebalancing to Asia-Pacific strategy, especially the military component, has been perceived negatively in China largely because it is believed to be aimed at China. Over the years, it has worsened the fragile strategic trust between the two nations.  If the next US Congress and administration adopt the CSIS report, it will only mean deeper distrust and more likelihood of a miscalculation, not to mention the report is likely to fuel an arms race in the region. And if fully implemented, it will make the Asia-Pacific region the most militarized in the world, with US weaponry.  One Chinese journalist who was at the release of the report on Wednesday said bluntly: ""It should be called a China containment report.""  It is just one of several reports by the US in recent years calling for a tougher stance on China.  Jeffrey Bader, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Obama administration official for Asia, refuted such thinking last June in his article ""Changing China Policy: Are we in search of enemies?"" He hoped the next president will not discard the play book used by the American statesmen who built and nurtured the US-China relationship and built a generation of peace in Asia.  On Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations, former US defense secretary Robert Gates also called for a careful management of the relationship and said the US should acknowledge China's influence and role in the world.  But, unless they are doing marketing for the US military complex, it is the idea that the US should dominate the world that is clearly behind the CSIS report.

Self-glorification in State of Union address ignored US' problems,1/15/2016,"                              US President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in Washington, January 12, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]      In his last State of the Union address on Tuesday, US President Barack Obama talked about the need to fix domestic politics, but he could not forgo playing politics in a bid to push the US Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  With strong opposition to the TPP from most of his fellow Democrat lawmakers, Obama seems to believe that fear-mongering about China is a good way to sell the trade agreement reached last Oct 5 by 12 Pacific Rim nations. He did not say, however, that China is actually the largest trading partner for many of these 12 nations.  Obama claimed that ""with TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do"". He seems to believe that China, the world's largest trading nation and second-largest economy, should not be included or have a say in making regional and global trade rules.  That is not the type of leadership the world needs or expects from a US president.  When politicians demonize others, they often betray a lack of self-confidence. Obama claimed that ""people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead - they call us.""  To be honest, such a self-glorifying State would not please anybody's ardent supporters because it talked only about his ""great"" success and hardly anything about his shortcomings or failures, and it only talked about how ""great"" the US is and hardly anything about the sorry state of the superpower today.  While touting the progress made in cutting the government deficit, Obama did not-mention that the US national debt has surpassed $18 trillion, much of which happened during his presidency.  He claimed that the US has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to fight the Islamic State group, but he did not say that many of the weapons that the IS uses are made in the US and today the terrorists group has spread to more countries. Libya, a disaster created by the Obama administration when it pursued regime change by abusing a 2011 UN Security Council resolution, has gradually become a haven for IS extremists. The US' standing in the Middle East is at its lowest compared with other parts of the world, according to 2015 Pew Center survey.  It was both surprising and ironic to hear Obama proudly claiming that ""we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined"". And the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was clearly excited that the US remains by far the world's largest vendor of weapons.  Obama regretted that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better under his presidency. But he did not take any personal responsibility for his often divisive language that has made cooperation and conciliation difficult with the Republicans. There is no doubt that Washington has become increasingly dysfunctional under his presidency, and he has made US-style democracy less appealing in other parts of the world.  As I went to New York Penn Station on Wednesday on my way back to Washington, crowds craned their necks to look at the information screens. They then poured into a narrow entrance to board their trains. During the train ride, you see rusty and dilapidated bridges, rundown buildings and roads with potholes, not to mention that the journey takes three and a half hours, a time that could by half with China's high-speed rail.  This is the picture of a developing country and not the one Obama described on Tuesday night.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Those who wish China ill will only hurt themselves,1/8/2016,"                              Trade volume between China and the US hit $441.6 billion in the first three quarters of the year, surpassing the $438.1 billion in trade between Canada and the US. [Photo/IC]      If you listened to the comments of some government officials, lawmakers, pundits and commentators, it is not hard to realize that there are people in the United States who wish China ill.  These people never seem to understand that as former US treasury secretary Larry Summers once said, it is possible to imagine a 21st century in which both China and the US do well, or in which neither does well, but hard to imagine one will do well and the other will not.  The past days have shown why it is foolish to harbor any ill will toward China.  The world expressed shock and condemnation on Wednesday after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, and much of the talk in the US has been on how important China is to defuse the situation on the Korean Peninsula, given China's longstanding ties with its neighbor to the northeast.  While such a statement may be only partly true, the expectation came from some who often treat China as an adversary of the US.  And on Monday, the tumbling Chinese stock market sparked a global sell-off, including a decline on the US markets. The impact from a slowdown of the Chinese economy has become a major topic in the US recently. This just shows how intertwined China and the global economy have become, especially the world's two largest economies, the US and China.  If those people wishing China ill were truly successful, it only means that the US stock markets and economy would be hit badly, and for a long time to come.  The UN Climate Conference in Paris in December was a great example showing that it serves the interests of both countries and indeed the entire world when China and the US work together, instead of against each other. And there is a long list of such challenges awaiting closer cooperation between the two nations, from promoting global economic growth and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons to counter terrorism and ensuring regional stability.

"By dragging feet on metric system, US leaves world puzzled",12/26/2015,"                              People shop in a store in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Monday. [Photo/Agencies]      News from Puerto Rico is depressing these days as the United States Congress last week denied the beautiful Caribbean Island a bankruptcy bailout to overcome its deep debt. Unlike a formal US state, Puerto Rico, which became a US territory in 1898 following the US invasion during the Spanish-American War, is not allowed to declare bankruptcy.  Puerto Rico may be heading into default in 2016, but I have found a bright spot on the island during my recent trips there. Apart from the fact that most Puerto Ricans speak Spanish rather than English, the island is one of only two places in US territory where the metric system is used. The other is Guam, which the US also seized from Spain in 1898.  At gas stations in Puerto Rico, prices are listed as dollar per liter, unlike per gallon in formal US states. And to measure distance and weight, meters, kilometers, and kilograms are used instead of feet, miles, and pounds.  While these signs may make American tourists feel quite foreign in a US territory, it makes international travelers much more at home.  Despite having studied, worked and lived in the US for years, I still cannot figure out that 7-foot-5 actually means a 2.26-meter-tall guy like Yao Ming, and I have to do my math while filling out any form that requires my height in feet instead of meters.  The weather app on my iPhone is displayed in Celsius, instead of Fahrenheit, because I am still not quite numerically adept at telling the high of 57 F on Wednesday in New York is actually 16 C.  I am not the only one left confused with all the miles and pounds and Fahrenheits. Many Chinese and people from other countries traveling, studying, working or living in the US suffer the same predicament, as the US remains one of only three countries in the world to not have adopted the metric system. The other two are Myanmar and Liberia.  The US was one of the original 17 signatory countries to the 1875 Metric Convention, or the Treaty of the Metre. The US Congress in 1975 passed the Metric Conversion Act to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the country, but so far progress has been extremely disappointing.  The United Kingdom, which invented the so-called Imperial System, has witnessed huge progress in using the metric system. Canada and Mexico, two neighbors and major trade partners of the US, also use the metric system. And Myanmar officials announced three years ago the government's intention to convert to the metric system.  A superpower and the world's largest economy like the US not adopting the metric system not only inconveniences international exchange and communications, but also leads to a huge waste of resources for foreign exporters tackling the US market or US exporters expanding in the global market, and certainly bad for fighting climate change.  I am not sure if any of the so-called high-level Trans-Pacific Partnership members has raised the adoption of the metric system as a criterion to reduce unnecessary barriers and costs of trade.  Lincoln Chafee, former Rhode Island governor who has dropped out of the 2016 Democratic presidential race, was probably the only candidate who campaigned for the US to go metric.  There is no doubt that the metric system has been and is the global rule and norm of the 21st century. It is also an area where the US has clearly fallen far behind.

A problem on the home front US can do without,12/18/2015,"                      Visiting the United States for the first time in 1993, I was deeply impressed by how rich, vibrant and advanced the country was. At the same time, I was appalled by the huge army of homeless people on the streets of the big cities such as New York, Washington, San Francisco and even Honolulu.  I spent a year in Honolulu, where I was told that some states actually sent their homeless to Hawaii so that they wouldn't freeze to death in winter, something I still find difficult to believe and have not been able to verify.  However, 22 years on there can be no doubting the population of the homeless in the US is huge, ranging from half a million to more than 3 million depending on the source of data. In New York City, widely regarded as the greatest American city, it has swollen to a staggering 60,000, nearing the city's record. In fact, two of the city's top officials in charge of homelessness affairs resigned recently due to the slow progress on this front. That there is a Department of Homeless Services in New York shows the severity of the chronic societal problem.  I will never forget a scene outside China Daily's New York office building on 43rd Street years ago, as a homeless man sat outside in snowy winter making his bed by a grate on the sidewalk.  In Washington where I now live and work, homeless people are often seen squeezing into cardboard box homes at night in the city center. Washington's DuPont Circle and Farragut Square, which I pass by often, are two of the parks where homeless people are a permanent scene, and they include some people who hold signs reading ""Please Help Homeless Veterans"".  Outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library near Chinatown in the US capital, every day sees long queues of homeless people waiting to be picked up and taken to temporary shelters.  According to a report in The Washington Post in May, last winter there were 11,623 people without permanent shelter in the Washington region.  While touting respect for veterans has become a trend in American politicians, the serious issue of homelessness in the US, especially among veterans, has never been mentioned in the Republican presidential debates, including the one held in Las Vegas on Tuesday.  This is despite the fact that a Gallup poll in March showed that more than one-third of American respondents (37 percent) worry ""a great deal"" and 27 percent worry ""a fair amount"" about hunger and homelessness in the US. Another 27 percent said they worry ""a little"", only 8 percent said they were ""not at all"" worried.  The warmth in this otherwise extremely cold and sad situation comes from the many charity organizations that try to help the homeless. Just as I left Washington for New York last weekend for a month-long trip, I saw a stand set up in Edward R. Murrow Park near the World Bank and International Monetary Fund headquarters distributing food and daily necessities to the homeless.  Ironic given that the mission of the World Bank, whose largest shareholder is the US, is to reduce and eradicate poverty.  US leaders like to talk about how great their country is. That might be true in many respects. But when it comes to tackling the problem of homelessness, it has clearly been a huge failure.  A great nation should not have homeless people waiting outside convenience stores, subway stations and parks, as in New York City.

Trade policy harms Obama's climate legacy,12/11/2015,"                              President Xi Jinping greets US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the UN climate conference near Paris on Monday. Evan Vucci / AP      China is often portrayed in a negative light by US politicians. However, fighting climate change may be an exception following the agreements reached by the leaders of the two countries to cut their carbon emissions.  When US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday in Paris, he cited the ambitious post-2020 mitigation commitments made by the world's two largest economies and greenhouse gas emitters as, ""proof that the roadblocks that we've hit for decades can be removed from our path"".  To reach its ambitious goals, China has made a great leap forward in investing and developing its renewable energy. Li Junfeng, director for climate strategy at the National Development and Reform Commission, told the International New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference this week that China wants to generate 150 to 200 gigawatts of electricity using solar power by 2020, possibly quadrupling the previous target. China also wants to sharply lift its wind power targets to 250 Gwby the same year.  In 2014, China invested $89.5 billion in renewable energy, up 32 percent from the previous year, and about 73 percent more than the investment made by the US, according to a report from The Climate Group.  This is just a reflection of the Chinese government's resolve to fight global climate change and the country's serious air pollution and environmental degradation, which are major concerns for the government and people.

US unwise to play alliance card against China,12/4/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama (R) welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington September 25, 2015. [Photo/Agency]      The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington held a talk on Tuesday to explore the emerging US security partnerships in Southeast Asia with focus on Myanmar, Vietnam and Indonesia. As the talk continued, it became clear such security partnerships are aimed at China, not countries like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  China has always followed a foreign policy of non-alliance. That is why when the Barack Obama administration made strengthening the US' security alliance its top priority in its ""pivot to Asia"" strategy, he raised China's concerns because there is little doubt that Washington's strategy is aimed at Beijing.  China's Foreign Ministry has termed the US security alliances a ""Cold War legacy"". Even some other countries feel it is unfair for the US to use its alliances against non-aligned countries. Despite Washington's partisan-divide, its move to bolster security alliances seems to have support. For instance, the US is trying to build an alliance of convenience with Vietnam, a country with which it has little in common in terms of values and political systems, except that Vietnam has a maritime dispute with China.  China is not likely to change its non-alliance policy anytime soon, but Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, has long advocated that China change its foreign policy and develop its own alliances.  In a recent article titled ""China-US Competition for Strategic Partners"", Yan has argued that to become a superpower like the US, China needs a new strategy that fully embraces genuine alliances, and not just so-called strategic partnerships.

"Time to address root cause, drop double standards",11/20/2015,"                                             A card that reads ""Pray for France"" is placed outside the French Embassy in Washington D.C., Nov 13, 2015. Over 100 people were killed in a mass hostage-taking at a Paris concert hall Friday and many more were feared dead in a series of bombings and shootings.[Photo/Xinhua]      The terrorist attack in Paris last Friday that killed 129 people and the bombing of Russian jet on Oct 31 in which 224 lives were lost are just the latest atrocities that should be condemned by the whole world.  After the Paris attacks, cities around the world lit their landmarks in the colors of the French flag to show their support for the French people. That also included the Oriental Pearl TV Tower in my home city of Shanghai.  But while expressing sympathy for the victims of the terrorist attacks, many Chinese are asking what has caused the growing number of extremists like those of the Islamic State group.           The answer given by most US politicians seems quite simple: They hate our values, they hate our democracy, they hate our freedom and they hate ourway of life. But such a reply hardly seems to address the question.  Of course, US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has blamed the prolonged war following the US invasion of Iraq as a cause. While such an answer does speak some truth, it is so politically incorrect that most US news media would not allow a live discussion.  US leaders, so eager to pursue regime change in Syria, have also blamed President Bashar al-Assad for the rise of IS. This is hardly convincing given many of the IS extremists are from other countries in the Middle East and Europe.  The debate over whether Assad must go has been hampering possible and better cooperation between Russia and the US in fighting the IS group. In fact, the US insistence on regime change has also prevented itself from fighting IS effectively.           "
Dominant power should leave space for the rising rest,11/13/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 20, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      Larry Summers is an insider of the Obama administration having served as director of the White House United States National Economic Council from January 2009 to November 2010.  The economist, however, is unhappy about the Obama administration's lack of accommodation for a rising China.  Just back from a trip to China, Summers, former US president Bill Clinton's treasury secretary, believes China is likely to account for between one-third and one-half of growth in global incomes, trade and commodity demand. In an article published in the Financial Times on Monday, he claimed that its significance will only increase as its share of the world economy rises.  Summers expressed concern over a lack of clarity about whether the objective of the US and the rest of the global community is to see China succeed economically as a support for global prosperity or the objective is to contain and weaken China economically.  He was upset over the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement which the Obama administration promotes as a way to reduce China's influence in determining global trade rules. To Summers, if China is not part of the TPP and the US not part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank things don't look auspicious. He believes that China's economic reform agenda will benefit not only China, but the whole world in the long term despite some short and medium-term pain from slower growth.  Summers once said that it's impossible in today's world for only one of the two countries, China and the US, to do well and the other not to do well.  Such a message from a former Obama administration insider is powerful. It shows that some kind of containment element indeed exists in the US' rebalancing to Asia strategy, the TPP and its attitude toward the AIIB.           "
More exchanges and cooperation will improve trust,11/6/2015,"                              The US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen sails in the Pacific Ocean in a November 2009 photo provided by the US Navy. [Photo/Agencies]      What happened on Tuesday may shed light on the state of China-US military-to-military ties.  That morning, the Naval Station May port in Jacksonville, Florida, welcomed three vessels of the PLA Navy, which are on an around-the-world tour after completing their anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden. These were the first PLA Navy vessels to pay a call to a port on the East Coast of the United States.  On the same day, the Peace Ark, the PLA Navy hospital ship, paid a port call to San Diego, California.  Both visits include plenty of interactions between the personnel of the two navies, as well as with the local communities.  In Jacksonville, I saw a warm welcoming ceremony hosted by the US Navy Region Southeast. The words of Rear Admiral Mary Jackson of US Navy and Wang Jianxun, commanding officer of the visiting Chinese fleet, were encouraging, emphasizing respect, understanding and cooperation. Basketball, soccer and tug-of-war games and joint exercises are scheduled activities to help foster these.  Also on Tuesday, US Pacific Command Commander Harry Harris met Fan Changlong, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, during his visit to China. While differences over thorny issues such as South China Sea remain, both stressed the importance of more exchanges and cooperation. On the same day, China's Minister of National Defense Chang Wanquan and his US counterpart Ash Carter convened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The military-to-military relationship has matured quite a bit. Tensions resulting from the USS Lassen entering waters around Chinese isles without permission have triggered strong protest from China, but not a suspension of military-to-military exchanges and cooperation, as it would have a few years ago.  On the contrary, such exchanges and cooperation should only be strengthened given the still overall lack of contact between the two militaries. For many US Navy officers and crew in Jacksonville, it was their first time interacting with their PLA Navy counterparts face-to-face.  So while Carter continued to voice his concern over China's activities in the South China Sea and cyberspace on Tuesday, he also accepted an invitation extended to him to visit China next spring.  On the other side, the Chinese have long felt upset with US arms sales to Taiwan, which is part of China, and also the US Navy's frequent close-in reconnaissance missions off China's coast as well as the ridiculous US law passed by Congress to restrict, rather than encourage, military-to-military exchanges with China.  More exchanges and cooperation could help reduce the serious misunderstanding that exists between the two countries today. The port call in Jacksonville comes as a great opportunity for Americans to know more about the PLA Navy's anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. Such operations by the PLA Navy benefit the world as they defend freedom of navigation.  Misunderstanding and misinterpretation are rife these days. Some news outlets have misread the words by PLA Navy Commander Wu Shengli in his recent video conference with his US counterpart John Richardson as a threat. But what Wu said ca qiang zou huo (to shoot accidentally while polishing a gun) is really meant as advice or a warning at most, not a threat.  The same is true for the allegation by some US politicians that portray China as a threat to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Few seem to be aware that freedom of navigation there means at least as much to China as any other nation, so it makes no sense that China would want to jeopardize it.  The differences between the two nations and two militaries are likely to remain for a long while, but ca qiang zou huo is less likely if the two militaries continue to beef up their exchanges and cooperation.

Clear and present dangers from US' self-appointed role,10/30/2015,"                              The guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen (front) conducts a trilateral naval exercise with the Turkish and South Korean Navy on May 25, 2015. [Photo/IC]      The high-profiled dispatch of a US naval ship into the South China Sea on Tuesday is not just bullying, but also ill-advised.        The message sent by the destroyer USS Lassen is that the mighty US military and navy is not to be challenged by any other country in the world.  It was just like the Taiwan Strait crisis in 1996 when the then-US president Bill Clinton ordered two US aircraft carrier strike groups into the region as a show of force.  The result of that is evident: Chinese don't have short memories, and China has made a great leap forward since then in developing its anti-ship ballistic missiles and its navy.  Over the years, the United States has expressed concerns over the Chinese military modernization, but what it did on Tuesday will only propel China to speed up its military modernization so it can't be coerced by others militarily.  Nevertheless, the provocation on Tuesday came as a surprise to many since it is just a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to the US. While issues of cybersecurity and the South China Sea were not resolved during the summit, many had hoped that relations would no longer be as tense as they were before the trip.  In the past days, US officials, including Defense Secretary Ash Carter in a hearing on Tuesday, have asserted that the US military will fly, sail and operate wherever international law permits. But there is no international court or law denying China's claim of sovereignty to the isles in South China Sea.  As Amitai Etzioni, a famed US intellectual and professor of George Washington University, said on Wednesday, the US has appointed itself as a ""global judge"" and exercises its freedom of navigation based on unilateral decisions.  There is no doubt that the US is eager to reassure its allies in the region that it is still the dominant power in the region in the wake of a fast-rising China. Yet it would be naive to think that China would drop its sovereignty claims just to satisfy Washington's will.  Washington has been skillful in using international law as a pretext because it only applies the law to others, not itself. The magistrates are free to burn down houses, but ordinary people are forbidden to light their lamps, as the Chinese saying goes.  For example, there is certainly no international law to support the US arming Syrian rebels and bombing Syria, a sovereign nation. But when Russia launched air strikes against the Islamic State group at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government, the US protested.  The same is true about the US drone strikes which have escalated dramatically under President Barack Obama in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.  A report on Oct 15 by The Intercept, based on classified documents it had obtained, shows that nearly 90 percent of people killed in recent drone strikes in Afghanistan ""were not the intended targets"" of the attacks. And the number in Somalia and Yemen may even be worse.  And the UN human rights organization has long said the Guantanamo Bay detention center, where prisoners are held without trial, is a violation of international law.  As the world's only superpower, the US government can truly afford to be thick-skinned, such as when it was condemned on Tuesday for the 24th year in a row for its embargo on Cuba, this time by 191 of the 193-member UN General Assembly. Only the US and Israel opposed.  All these show how absurd it would be for the US to appoint itself as the global judge.

Leaders' summits great way to boost bilateral relations,10/10/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama (R) welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington September 25, 2015. [Photo/Agency]      There is no doubt that President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama, or any top Chinese and US leaders, should hold summit meetings more often.  The reason is quite simple. Such summits have the potential to change the dynamic of China-US relations for the better, as has been proved by the three summits between Xi and Obama.  The two leaders met in June 2013 in the California desert retreat of Sunnylands, in November 2014 in Yingtai, an imperial palace in Beijing's Zhongnanhai, the headquarter of China's central government, and last week in Blair House, across the street from the White House.  The shirt-sleeves summit in Sunnylands, which was held a few months after Xi became Chinese president and less than five months after Obama assumed his second term, turned out to be a good opportunity for the two leaders to get to know each other better and build a closer personal relationship. With a private dinner and formal group meetings, the two leaders met for more than eight hours, unlike the 30-minute chats they usually had on the sidelines of multilateral events.  Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security advisor for strategic communication, recently cited Obama as saying the private dinners at the summits have been the most constructive part, because he and Xi didn't have to go through the long list of items on formal agendas and state their country's stance, as happens in formal meetings. Instead they could conduct in-depth talks about where they wanted to take their country and offer a vision of how the US and China might work together.  Rhodes attributed the historic climate agreement announced in Beijing last November during Obama's trip to Beijing as an outcome of the two leaders' informal conversations in the relaxed setting of Sunnylands.

Obama's careless words only incite misunderstanding,10/9/2015,"                              Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct. 5, 2015. Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries ""have successfully concluded"" the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade talks, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said Monday. [Photo/Xinhua]      US President Barack Obama has described the US-China relations as the most consequential in the 21st century, but he does not seem to care about harming it himself in order to pursue selfish political gain.  On Monday, when news came that the United States and 11 other countries had reached an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, Obama said in his statement that ""when more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment.""  While one may not feel surprise to hear such rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail of people like real estate billionaire Donald Trump, it is shocking that a nation's president will speak in such an irresponsible manner. And it is not true because unlike the US, China has never said it wants to write the rules for global economy, at least not alone.  The ulterior motive behind Obama's words is clear. While Obama was ecstatic after the Monday agreement in Atlanta, Georgia, he knew too well that the approval by the US Congress is still an uphill battle, especially during the presidential election season.  What's ironic in the US partisan politics is that this is perhaps the first time when the Democratic president will stand side by side with mostly Republicans to fight his fellow Democrats, as 80 percent of Democratic Congressmen oppose the TPP. Even his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, now a front runner in the 2016 race for the White House, publicly opposed it on Wednesday.  In fact, the opposition to TPP has been strong among both Democratic and Republican candidates in the 2016 race.  To turn the tide, Obama has chosen to resort to scare tactics by using China as the bogeyman. He did that in 2012 during his re-election campaign against Governor Mitt Romney, and he did that again several months ago while lobbying the Congress to pass the fast-track Trade Promotion Authority.  By spreading that kind of message among the US public, the US president is clearly promoting misunderstanding about China and inciting resentment among American people towards China.  This is especially dangerous when average Americans know very little about China. Former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski sighed last week in a seminar, saying that ""the vast majority of Americans don't have a clue of what's happening in the world scene. And I mean it literally.""  And literally speaking, such an audience could be easily manipulated by the inflammatory remarks of their president.  In a nationwide China Town Hall conference on Monday held by the National Committee on US-China Relations, Sheldon Day, mayor of Thomasville, Alabama, talked about how he, in trying to bring Chinese investment to his city, has to convince local public deeply affected by the negative rhetoric on China in the US political scene.  The remarks by Obama and presidential candidates such as Trump certainly contribute to such public confusion.  Based on Obama's remarks, he needs to explain why the US is not using the TPP in a geopolitical game, and how his rhetoric on writing trade rules does not signal the US means to exclude China, now the world's largest trading nation and home to one-fifth of humanity.

"US, Chinese approach to ties sharply differ",9/25/2015,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at a U.S.-China business roundtable, comprised of U.S. and Chinese CEOs, in Seattle, Washington September 23, 2015. The Paulson Institute, in partnership with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, co-hosted the event. [Photo/Agencies]      Senior Chinese and US government officials had been speaking and writing on China-US relations in the run-up to President Xi Jinping's state visit to the United States. The tone of senior US officials, including a policy speech by National Security Advisor Susan Rice at George Washington University on Monday, has seen a clear shift toward a more positive and cooperative plane despite the media's obsession with the South China Sea issue and cyber hacking.  It is a pity that speeches by Rice and other US officials are not widely covered, let alone broadcast live, by US media outlets. Nevertheless, stronger emphasis on expanding cooperation while effectively managing differences is a welcome sign.  It doesn't take a careful reader much to see that there are major differences in the Chinese and American styles of approaching bilateral relations.  From the speech delivered by Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Lanting Forum in Beijing on Sept 16 to President Xi's speech in Seattle on Tuesday evening, Chinese leaders have been, as always, laying stress on the overall positive picture of Sino-US ties. They have refrained from pointing the finger at or trying to embarrass the US.  However, many US officials, despite the relative change in tone, still cannot resist lecturing others. For example, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday was basically an article on ""China must do this and China must do that"", something people cannot find in recent op-ed pieces by Chinese officials, such as State Councilor Yang Jiechi or Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai. The same US arrogance is found in Rice's speech and the statements of other senior US officials.  These US officials have publicly accused China of being a state-sponsor of cyber-theft, posing a threat to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, violating human rights and not conducting economic reforms as the US expected. It is like telling Chinese leaders that they don't know how to run a country of close to 1.4 billion people despite the fact that the dysfunction in Washington, not the state on the West Coast where Xi started his US visit, has become a malady of US politics.  Many in the US have longed to see Chinese become more like Americans. But does that mean they also long to see senior Chinese officials pointing the finger at and lecturing the US, as their US counterparts have been doing these days and throughout the past decades?  For example, Chinese officials could tell the US to stop its aggressive and wide-ranging surveillance, led by the National Security Agency, something that has angered the whole world, including some US allies.  China could also tell the US to stop its military interventions in sovereign nations, which have created a huge mess in the Middle East and North Africa. The US still owes the rest of the world an apology for invading Iraq and Afghanistan, which caused untold human disasters that the two countries and their neighbors are stilling suffering from today. On the pretext of spreading democracy, the US-led NATO pursued regime change in Libya by abusing a UN Security Council resolution on no-fly zone. Libya today is plagued by the worst mayhem in its history.  China, in contrast, has done nothing destructive to world peace.  Chinese officials could tell the US to stop selling arms to Taiwan and suspend its frequent close-in surveillance along China's coast, or China will make plans to send reconnaissance planes and ships to US coasts as a reciprocal response.  China should also tell the US to close its Guantanamo Bay detention center, address its gun violence, racial discrimination and corruption, as Gallup poll last week found that 75 percent of Americans believed corruption is widespread in the US government.  Will Americans still want Chinese to become more like them?  The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Poll shows need for Sino-US big picture,9/12/2015,"                                   A Pew Research Center survey released on Wednesday is a cause for concern, especially as it comes ahead of President Xi Jinping's state visit to the United States. It shows that 54 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of China, while just 38 percent view it favorably. The negative rating of China among Americans is even worse than what it was in 2008 - 42 percent.  The major problems American citizens see in the Beijing-Washington relationship include the huge US debt held by China, the loss of US jobs to China, alleged cyberattacks from China, China's human rights policies, US trade deficit with China as well as China's impact on the global environment, its growing military power, and the tension between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.  The Pew Research Center survey is not surprising because the issues mentioned above have become the talking points of US politicians and the media in recent years, and shows how powerful politicians and the media are in shaping public opinion.  It is true that China, as the world's largest developing country, has some room for improvement in fields such as environmental protection and safeguarding human rights.  But more Americans' voicing concern over the debt held by China than anything else sounds absurd. Should Americans be happy knowing that China dumped nearly $100 billion US Treasury bonds in August, making itself a smaller creditor of the US?  The concern over loss of US jobs to China, too, is absurd. Over the years, researchers such as Andrew McAfee, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of Race Against the Machine, have found technology is responsible for the loss of most jobs. And two years ago, researchers at Oxford University found that 45 percent of the US' occupations would be automated within the next 20 years.  As for the US trade deficit with China, the figure is quite misleading. Economist Zachary Karabell, for example, has said Apple's iPhone sales in the US alone were adding $6 billion to $8 billion a year to the trade deficit because each iPhone that Apple sells in the US increases the deficit by about $200. The reason: they are assembled in China. On the other hand, the Asian Development Bank estimates that less than $10 per iPhone or iPad ends up in the Chinese economy.  As a journalist, I understand the role of news media as a watchdog. But the fact is, the public, which depends on news media for information, may not be well or correctly informed about the big picture.  When asked whether China-US ties have been hijacked by cyber-hacking and South China Sea issues, former US ambassador to China Stapleton Roy, a highly respected China hand, bluntly said the issues have been hijacked by the media. Indeed, they are important issues, but many other important issues have not received much media attention. A similar example is the US media's excessive coverage of billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump while neglecting serious and rational debates on key issues facing the US and the world.  Polls mean a lot to US politicians. But the latest Pew Research Center poll result on China could be the outcome of surveying not-so-well-informed people. Since most US congressmen and presidential candidates don't have much knowledge about China, how can one expect average American citizens to be well informed about China?  These facts mean the two countries' top leaders, Xi and Barack Obama, will have a major task on hand when they meet later this month: to present their citizens the big picture of China-US relations. That is no less urgent than tackling the cybersecurity and South China Sea issues.  The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com             "
Some in the West still stuck in Cold War,9/4/2015,"                              Soldiers of PLA march in formation past the Tian'anmen Square before a military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Beijing. [Photo/Agencies]       The military parade in Beijing on Thursday was the public highlight of this year's event to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the victory in World War II and the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).  Veterans, from both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Russia, the United States and several other countries, attended the parade.  About 11 hours before the Beijing parade, dozens of US veterans who fought the Imperial Japanese Army in the Pacific theater during the war gathered at the National WWII Memorial in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary.  The recollections of the veterans show how closely China and the US fought alongside each other. Thomas Robert Vaucher, who flew 117 combat missions in the Pacific, remembers well that some 9,200 Chinese built an air base outside Chengdu, not with mechanical devices, but with their muscles. Vaucher praised the Chinese for the huge role they played in fighting the Japanese.  The message from these commemorative events is simple and clear. We should learn the hard lessons from the past and do our utmost to ensure world peace. The huge loss of Chinese lives was recognized. At least 35 million Chinese either lost their lives or were injured during the war, more than any other nation.  However, China's military parade has too often been misinterpreted in the West as a show of muscle based on what they claim is its desire to project assertiveness in the South China Sea.  This is completely untrue.  China's economy is closely linked with the global economy. Building a military capable of protecting its interests, such as patrolling the Gulf of Eden against rampant piracy, is a rational decision. With stronger capabilities, China will also be able to shoulder more responsibilities. China is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping missions of the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  Nothing justifies the accusation that China will try to rock the boat and bring chaos and conflict to the region. China depends on a peaceful environment for its development, not only over the past 30 to 40 years, but today and in the future.  Unlike the United States and some other nations, China does not have military bases overseas. And President Xi Jinping announced on Thursday that China will cut its troop levels by 300,000.  The West's misperception of China should not come as a surprise, because China, with its different political system, has long been viewed with deep suspicion by the West - a legacy of the Cold War. The West is always right and China, which is ruled by one party, is always wrong.  Such a Cold War mentality has indeed prevented them from looking at facts objectively. For example, many in the West do not seem bothered by the US-led invasion of Iraq, which is still in chaos at the cost of countless lives. Instead, they have joined the US to play up the non-existent China threat to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.  Such a mentality is in urgent need of change, because for China the Cold War is long over.

US' candidates have nothing to offer have-nots,8/28/2015,"                              Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks to reporters as he arrives in Laredo, Texas July 23, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]       Of all the Republican and Democrat candidates in the 2016 US presidential race, almost each and every of them claims that he or she will fight for Main Street not Wall Street, despite the fact that big businesses often finance most of the campaigns.  A Gallup poll released last week may well explain why these candidates, in a bid to win votes, are so eager to pledge that they will be the true savior of less-advantaged Americans.  The survey finds that only 58 percent of Americans see themselves as ""haves"" while 38 percent regard themselves as ""have-nots"". The percentage of have-nots has more than doubled since 1988, but has been more stable in recent years.  And 45 percent of the people in the survey say they think the US society has been divided into groups of haves and have-nots, compared with only 26 percent in 1988.  These findings came after a May survey which showed that 63 percent of Americans say money and wealth distribution is unfair in the United States.  It is not hard for someone living in Washington to see the have-nots. Just around my office in the National Press Building or the DuPont Circle on my way home or under an overpass passing the Rock Creek Park, homeless people are a daily scene, even amid the snows of winter.  On any given night, there are 7,784 homeless people in the District of Columbia, according to the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness.  African-Americans are among the most underprivileged groups, as revealed by both the survey and their frustrations vented during the recent protests in many US cities.  While class struggle was a catchphrase in China during the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76) and income inequality is also challenging China today, there is no doubt that there is also a very real class struggle in the US today, despite the fact that US officials and mainstream news media never use such a politically incorrect term.

Blame game a sign of US relative decline,8/21/2015,"                              Strategic and Economic Dialogue principals, including Vice-Premier Wang Yang (first left), Vice-Premier Liu Yandong (second left) and State Councilor Yang Jiechi (third left), meet with US President Barack Obama and members of his Cabinet in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington on Wednesday. [Photo/Agencies]      On Wednesday morning at the Hudson Institute, pundits and former government officials were discussing how China's missile and space capability would threaten the United States. On Wednesday afternoon at the Atlantic Council, panelists were speculating how to respond to alleged Chinese cyber espionage.              These talks were held despite the fact that the US missile and space weaponry technology is unparalleled in the world. Using the American logic, it should really be the Chinese who get scared about US threat.  No one touched much on the wide-ranging cyber espionage conducted by the US National Security Agency after the revelations by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.  These are two of the many seminars in Washington every week where US officials and pundits play up the ""China threat,"" clearly forgetting that China has never engaged in armed conflict with any other nations for at least three decades and it was truly not China which has turned the Middle East into total chaos.  With the unfolding of US presidential election season, many candidates have again believed that making China a bogeyman will help them win votes, just like Republican candidate Mitt Romney tried in the 2012 race with his many Day-One vows on China.  For example, the sarcastically amusing celebrity Republican candidate Donald Trump said last week that China's recent devaluation of its currency would be ""devastating"" for the US. ""They're just destroying us,"" he said as if he were an economist.  Most economists, including those at IMF, believe Beijing's move is to make the yuan exchange rate more market-oriented. Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, described the Chinese move as exactly what the US has asked for a long time.  None of the US politicians could explain why the US economy has not boomed after the yuan appreciated dramatically in the past decade.  In announcing his presidential bid on June 16, Trump said: ""I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I will bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.  He did not say, however, what kind of jobs he will bring back. If he goes to Macy's and other department stores in the US, he will find that most clothing there are no longer made in China, but Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where wages are lower.  If Trump wants to make American workers weave cloth and sew garments again, China will be more than happy to move up the supply chain as its new economic strategy aspires to be.  For US politicians, naming China is almost habitual to show that they are tough and have the guts to be a leader regardless how irrelevant such comment is.  ""We borrow money from China for our daily expenses. That would be like borrowing money for groceries. Needs to stop!"" tweeted Rand Paul, a Senator from Kentucky, on Aug 12. ""We are borrowing money from China today,"" said Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal during the Aug 6 Republican presidential debate.  They both have missed the key issue, which is the US national debt is in excess of $18 trillion.  The real question for Paul and Jindal would be if it's not good to borrow from China, would it be okay for US to borrow money from US allies to further expand the national debt? And China certainly has not forced the US to borrow its money.  If a US president can lead his nation by blaming China and others, it must be the easiest job in this world.  Despite their annoyance at the US political blame game, many Chinese have also seen it as a reflection of growing importance and success of China and even a ""relative decline"" of the United States.

Lots of hypocrisy at play over carbon emissions,8/7/2015,"                              U.S. President Barack Obama delivers remarks on the Clean Power Plan at the White House in Washington August 3, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      Just a few hours after US President Barack Obama announced his ambitious new plan on Monday to limit carbon emissions from power plants to combat global warming, the Busboys & Poets restaurant-cum-bookstore in Washington drew a larger crowd than the White House East Room. There, Naomi Klein, a Canadian journalist and social activist, praised Obama's action, but she said it was one step in the right direction along with five in the wrong.              The Arctic drilling endorsed by Obama was one in the wrong direction, and this alone would disqualify Obama to be a climate leader, Klein said.  Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA, stood up in the audience to describe the 13 campaigners bravely hanging from the St Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon, on July 29 to block the icebreaker Fennica, leased by oil giant Shell for its Arctic drilling.  Klein was talking about her latest book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate at the bookstore. In the book, she condemns the neo-liberalism approach to fighting climate change. For example, she argues that it's not that the Western companies moving their production to China wanted to drive up emissions: they were after cheap labor, and exploited workers and an exploited planet are, it turns out, a package deal.  Klein has reminded Westerners who blame China and India for their growing emissions saying, ""as if it was not our governments and our multinationals that pushed a model of export-led development that made all of this possible"".  ""It is said as if it were not our own corporations who, with single-minded determination, turned the Pearl River Delta (region) into their carbon-spewing special economic zone, with the goods going straight onto container ships headed to our superstores,"" she writes.  Such a relocation of carbon emissions, or pollution, was not in Obama's speech on Monday in which he boasted ""the only reason that China is now looking at getting serious about its emissions is because they saw we are going to do it too"".  The reason that China is getting serious about combating climate change has nothing to do with Obama but with the worsening air pollution that has become the top concern for many of the Chinese.  It is true that China has been taking measures to curb pollution and fight climate change, but they are often dwarfed by the steps taken in the wrong direction. For example, the strategy to stimulate consumption in a bid to boost economic growth often means unnecessary spending that contributes to emissions.  Countries like China and India, with their huge populations, do not have the luxury of repeating the mistakes of Western nations. Per capita emissions in the US is now several times higher than China's, even if we do not subtract the emissions in China to produce goods bound for the US.  China, India and other developing countries still have to lift millions of people out of poverty, including giving many of them access to electricity. But the best way to do so is to embark on a low-carbon and sustainable path of development.

Curb China-US military rivalry to avoid conflict,7/31/2015,"                              Secretary of Defense Ash Carter poses for a photo with Gen. Fan Changlong, vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, at the Pentagon, June 11, 2015. [Photo/IC]      Southeast of the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia is a huge restricted access area known as Marine Corps Base Quantico. On Tuesday, I was among a group of foreign journalists allowed to visit the base to see how some 1,800 Marine officers are produced each year.  The Basic School of the Marine Corps is based here, and we watched five Marine officers demonstrate their martial arts skills, as well as a training session with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Live artillery fire was being conducted, with deafening blasts.  As a Chinese national, I had mixed feelings. China and the United States were allies during World War II, and I have met several US veterans who fought in China alongside Chinese against the Japanese invaders.  On Monday afternoon, I was chatting with Dan Petach, from New Jersey. He was so proud talking about his uncle John Petach, who served in China under General Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers, the 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, which helped the Chinese fight the Japanese aggressors during WWII. Petach had come to Washington for an exhibition about the Flying Tigers, who 70years after the end of the WWII, the Chinese still remember well and feel grateful to.  However, in the Cold War era, China and the US fought each other in the Korean War in the early 1950s. And China actively supported North Vietnam in war against the US during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s. They were both bloody wars that cost countless lives on all sides.  Today, the China-US relationship is so complicated that it is hard to reach a consensus on whether they are friends, enemies or ""frenemies"".  Fortunately, bilateral military-to-military ties, which had long lagged behind other areas in bilateral relations, have gathered steam in recent years with more high-level exchange visits and joint exercises, the most notable being China's participation in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercises for the first time in 2014.  Yet, it is disheartening to attend seminars where analysts talk about China's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy versus the US AirSea Battle doctrine, now known as the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons or JAM-GC for short.  Such strategies mean that the two countries will waste huge amounts of money on their militaries; money that could otherwise be better spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and other areas that improve people's lives.  Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger has warned about these strategies becoming self-fulfilling prophecies that result in conflict, as many Chinese see such tactics as an attempt to contain China while Americans see China's every move as a challenge to the US' sole superpower status.  Early this year, Harvard scholar Joseph Nye declared that treating China as an enemy, guarantees a future enemy, while treating China as a friend keeps open the possibility of a more peaceful future.  As the Marine martial arts trainer in Quantico talked about how to hurt and kill on Tuesday, I was thinking how destructive a war between China and the US would be, and how it should never be allowed to happen.  More exchanges between the two militaries will help reduce such a possibility, but the two nations' leaders, President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama, bear the foremost responsibility to help prevent military rivalry or an arms race escalating into conflict.

Making sense of the reestablishment of US-Cuba ties,7/24/2015,"                              This blindness is truly exceptional, but hopefully it is not part of the exceptionalism that many Americans use to define their country.      I was one of the about 800 people who gathered on Monday morning inside and outside the new Cuban embassy in Washington to observe the flag-raising ceremony as the United Stated and Cuba officially re-established diplomatic ties.        It was a historic moment, but one was forced to think why the historical animosity had lasted 54 years and more than 20 years since the end of the Cold War. The crowds on Monday were celebrating the new relationship, but most of the banners they held called for an end to US economic and trade embargo on Cuba and the return of the Cuban territory of Guantanamo, now occupied by the US and the site of a US naval base, including a notorious detention center, to Havana.        Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared that the historic restoration of diplomatic ties will only make sense if the US lifts its sanctions against and returns Guantanamo to Cuba. The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution every year since 1992 condemning the embargo, calling it a violation of the UN Charter and international law.  The US has been clearly on the wrong side of history far too long, not just on the embargo, but also in terms of its many attempts over the decades to try to assassinate former Cuban president Fidel Castro and overthrow the Cuban government.  But many American politicians have turned a deaf ear to the loud international outcry and instead chosen to continue living in the Cold War. The embargo has not only inflicted huge sufferings on the 11 million Cuban people, it has also been a punishment for US citizens who have been denied the freedom to travel as tourist to the beautiful island nation only 145 kilometers from Key West in Florida.  In their speeches, US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have acknowledged that the embargo and the efforts to isolate Cuba have not worked; rather they have made the US more isolated, especially in Latin America. But it took six long years for the Obama administration to spell out the truth.  Obama has urged the US Congress to lift the embargo. But that is unlikely to happen too any time soon given the strong opposition from Republican lawmakers. These lawmakers have been acting against the will of their constituents, as a Pew Center survey released on Tuesday showed that 73 percent of Americans approve of the re-establishment of diplomatic ties and 72 percent want the US to lift its trade embargo. Both figures are higher than in previous surveys.  However, on the issue of Guantanamo, the Obama administration continues to say that it has no intention of returning the Cuban territory to Havana. This only means that while the US tries to claim the moral high ground by pointing fingers at other countries over territorial disputes, it does not apply the same policy to shame itself for occupying a foreign land based on past unequal treaties, which only smacks of colonialism.  While the rest of the world treated the restoration of US-Cuban diplomatic ties as the top news of the day, US cable networks devoted most of their air time to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's surge in the polls, something that should have been the top subject of the Comedy Central channel.  Surprisingly, US media outlets have not dedicated any program to introduce today's Cuba, its people, culture and history to the American public, except highlighting the diatribe of some conservative American politicians.  Like the past more than two decades, the US news media are not likely to cover the condemnation of the US embargo on Cuba in the UN General Assembly in September, the 24th time in as many years.  This blindness is truly exceptional, but hopefully it is not part of the exceptionalism that many Americans use to define their country.

Iran nuclear deal opens new vistas of opportunities,7/17/2015,"                              Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (L-R) pose for a family picture after the last plenary session at the United Nations building in Vienna, Austria July 14, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      The long-term and comprehensive nuclear agreement reached on July 14 between Iran and P5+1 - China, the US, Russia, France, the UK plus Germany - should be applauded for opening a new channel of peace for not only the Middle East, but also the whole world.  The deal ended a 13-year marathon on the Iranian nuclear issue, showing diplomacy and dialogue is the way to tackle thorny regional and global issues.  For the two main players in the issue, Iran and the United States, the agreement has created a stage which they could use to thaw their more than three decades of icy relationship. Yes, the two countries still have many fundamental differences, but that only means they should meet with each other more often to resolve them.  US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry demonstrated the courage to move forward on the deal despite strong opposition from many Republicans back home. Those critics, of course, have provided no better alternative, except shouting for more sanctions or even military action. It seems they have forgotten the hard lessons the US has learned in the region over the past decade and more.  The invasion of Iraq in the name of demolishing the non-existent weapons of mass destruction has not only caused the deaths of countless Iraqis and thrown the country into what seems like eternal chaos, it also has cost the lives of thousands of US soldiers and forced American taxpayers to part with trillions of dollars.  This is not the only hard lesson the US should have learned in the Middle East. Look at Libya and Syria, where US military intervention policies have worsened matters, contrary to its declared good intentions, if there was any in the first place.  On the other hand, the imposition of more sanctions on Iran over the past decades has caused more sufferings for the 78 million Iranians, including women and children, by depriving them of better access to food, healthcare and education that they deserved. Sanctions that indiscriminately hurt ordinary people are a crime against humanity.  China and the US had huge differences back in 1971 when their leaders decided to break the ice. While many differences still remain, none would deny that both countries, as well as the rest of the world, have benefited enormously from their relationship.  For the same reason, the US and Iran should embark on a new era of engagement that will benefit not only the two countries and their peoples, but also the whole of volatile Middle East and the world beyond.  While Republican lawmakers in the US try to find ways to denounce the nuclear deal with Iran, American companies are looking at opportunities to invest and do business in Iran after restrictions are lifted.  That is true for China, too, which finds a sanctions-free Iran increasingly important in meeting its energy needs and implementing its ambitious ""Belt and Road Initiative"". Not for nothing was Iran a key point of the ancient Silk Road.  The Center for American Progress in Washington, the China-United States Exchange Foundation in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies issued a joint report on Monday to explore the avenues for China-US cooperation in the Middle East. Despite some starkly different approaches toward the region taken by China and the US, scholars say they should work together more intensely for their many common interests there. The report advises the two countries to avoid picking sides in the conflicts in the region and instead join hands to help the Middle East countries build the blocks of prosperity, enhanced governance and increased linkages to the global economy.  The nuclear deal and a possible improvement in US-Iran relations could greatly increase the prospect of making this vision a reality.

War anniversary statement a big test for Abe,7/10/2015,"                              Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reacts as he speaks to the media at his official residence in Tokyo in this Oct 20, 2014 file photo. [Photo/Agencies]      In the last minute of the seminar in Washington on Tuesday, moderator, Victor Cha, an expert on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former director for Asian affairs on the White House's National Security Council, asked the panelists to use one sentence to talk about Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's upcoming August statement on the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War II.  To me, that was a key question for the panelists to address because Abe's Aug 15 statement will be essential in helping nations in the region put the past behind them and move on.  The three panelists, all US experts on Japan, looked kind of embarrassed, as if it was the toughest question in the 75-minute talk. None of them actually touched on this issue by themselves, and now they all said they expected Abe not to break new ground but repeat what he has already said.  That is clearly not enough. While the revisionist Japanese prime minister may spend much time talking about Japan's contribution in the 70 years after the war, he should not and cannot avoid facing the past squarely at this critical time, given his many disturbing views and remarks on history. It is something the whole world is watching.  So far, Abe has only used vague language to say that he endorses the official statements made by his predecessors, but he has not gone nearly as far as the 1995 Murayama Statement when the then Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama sincerely apologized for the Japanese aggression.  If words like ""apology"" and ""aggression"" are still taboos for Abe to describe WWII, then his statement next month will be a humiliation to the millions of Chinese, Koreans and people of other nations who suffered from Japanese militarism before and during WWII.  Over the years, Abe has questioned whether Japan's actions in WWII constituted aggression and whether Japanese government and military coercion was involved in the ""comfort women"". In April last year, he sent a message to an annual ceremony honoring Class-A war criminals, saying ""(they) staked their souls to become the foundation of their nation"".  Some latest developments in Japan are equally troubling. Abe's revisionist historical views aside, he has actively pushed for changing Japan's pacifist Constitution, an increase in its defense spending and a hard line in territorial disputes with China and South Korea.  And the revision of high school textbooks reviewed by the Education Ministry in April further plays down the details of Japanese war atrocities, exactly the opposite of what the Japanese government should be teaching young Japanese about the war.  One textbook dropped a passage which said Japan ""came under international condemnation"" for slaughtering many Chinese during the 1937 Nanjing Massacre. The other added ""no proof of forced abduction has been found"" in a passage on the women forced into sexual slavery.  James Schoff, a senior associate of the Asian Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, voiced his concern over the textbook revision when I chatted with him after Tuesday's talk. He believes that compared with Germany, a less than complete purging of people involved in WWII atrocities and a lack of truth-seeking has contributed to such problems in Japan. In Germany, there has been real national soul-searching and people have learned the truths about that period in their nation's history.  Chinese leaders have repeatedly noted the importance of both facing the past truthfully and looking to the future in dealing with the China-Japan relations. Now it is up to Abe whether he truly wants reconciliation with Japan's neighbors by making an honest statement in August, instead of repeating his half-hearted rhetoric.

US marriage ruling resonates in China,7/3/2015,"                              Gay rights supporters celebrate after the US Supreme Court ruled that the US Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, June 26, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]      The US Supreme Court 5-4 ruling on June 26 that same-sex marriages are protected under the 14th amendment of the US Constitution was a landmark judgment not only for Americans but also many Chinese.  The ruling means that same-sex marriage is legal in all US states, instead of the 37 before last Friday. But stubborn opposition to same-sex marriage in states such as Texas, Alabama and Kentucky means there are still battles ahead.  Americans have come a long way on this front. The Stonewall Inn in New York stands as a testament of the 1969 riots by the LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender) community following a police raid of the bar.  When I spent a year in Honolulu between 1993 and 1994, people in Hawaii were fighting to make their state the first in the US to legalize same-sex marriage. The Crossroads Church across the street from the University of Hawaii at Manoa voiced their support. As a young Chinese journalist, I interviewed the president of the then Hawaii Gay and Lesbian Rights Association. However, it took Hawaii two decades to finally legalize same-sex marriage in December 2013.  It was already late at night in China when the US Supreme Court made the announcement. Yet many of my friends posted messages on the WeChat platform applauding the decision. Some quoted US President Barack Obama's words that ""love is love,"" while others were amused to hear Justice Anthony Kennedy who referenced Confucius' writing that ""marriage lies at the foundation of government.""  Some Chinese felt proud that Confucius' teaching was used in making this historic decision. Others expressed doubt about the true meaning of Confucius words. Fang Zhouzi, a popular science blogger, believes the English translation was wrong. Some opposing same-sex marriage have quoted Confucius as saying that there are three kinds of unfilial conduct, the worst being having no descendants.  Li Yinhe, a famous sociologist and sexologist who has long advocated for gay and lesbian rights in China and a lesbian herself, believes China also has to fight discrimination against its LGBT community.  While substantial progress has been made in China over the past two decades to protect the rights of the LGBT community, most Chinese are still not ready to embrace the group.  On April 25, a job fair in my hometown Shanghai for the LGBT community drew only 17 of the 150 companies invited. Unofficial statistics suggest that there are 30 million gays and lesbians aged 15 to 60 in China, most still living underground.  As a prelude to the US Supreme Court decision, seven gay and lesbian couples from China held a group wedding in West Hollywood, California, on June 9, an event sponsored by e-commerce giant Alibaba and China's largest gay dating app, Blued.  Back in Shanghai, it was a sign of progress that there was no local government interference in the seventh ShanghaiPRIDE festival, which concluded on June 21, as in some previous years. I witnessed the first festival in 2009 when some of the events had to be cancelled. A total of 6,000 people participated in this year's festival, which carried the theme of ""Love Is Our Future"" and included events such as a pride run, bike ride, panel discussions, performances, film screenings and of course, parties.  But still, Chinese officials, at local and central government levels, have not spoken publicly about the rights of gays and lesbians, since homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 and removed from the list of mental illnesses in 2001.  Hopefully the US Supreme Court decision last Friday will encourage the silent majority, officials and ordinary citizens alike, to take actions to help build a society that shows more tolerance and respect to the LGBT community and upholds their equal rights.

Welcome days for China-US engagement,6/26/2015,"                              U.S. President Barack Obama (4th R) and members of his cabinet welcome Strategic and Economic Dialogue principals, including China's Vice Premier Wang Yang (2nd L, with earpiece), Vice Premier Liu Yandong (3rd L, in blue) and State Councilor Yang Jiechi (4th L) in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington June 24, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      The US State Department in Foggy Bottom in Washington looked quite different from the rest of the year early this week when the 7th China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and 6th China-US High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange were held there.  The hallway was decorated with posters full of Chinese characters welcoming the delegates. Chinese and American national flags flew side by side in major meeting rooms. The directions to the press center, restrooms and even a press smoking area were in English and Chinese. I even teased a State Department official about how they knew that journalists go through the same stress as diplomats and thus need the customary smoking break.  There was definitely no sign of hostility or confrontation in Foggy Bottom, unlike that seen in the media and among some pundits when it comes to the relationship between the world's two largest economies. Yes, sensitive issues such as the South China Sea disputes and cyber security remain to be resolved - and may need a lot of time to do so - yet the gathering of hundreds of people from the two countries to discuss a wide spectrum of bilateral issues showed that both want to work together to expand cooperation and manage differences, which is exactly the goal of the S&ED and CPE.  There were 40 minister- and vice-minister-level officials from China, a clear demonstration of engagement by the Chinese side. The same was true of the US as President Barack Obama met with the Chinese delegates on Wednesday afternoon and Vice-President Joe Biden delivered a speech at the opening ceremony on Tuesday.  The China-US relationship has certainly matured, because some Chinese and US officials said they could now talk about anything and not really raise the temperature in the room. Indeed, there is more to China-US ties than what the daily news headlines convey.  When I covered Vice-Premier Liu Yandong's trip in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on June 19 ahead of the CPE where she co-chaired a meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry, I could feel that a solid foundation for the relationship is being built. The evidence was there, from American students studying Chinese at the Confucius Institute and Tsinghua University students interning at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine to Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto looking forward to visiting China in September and traveling to Pittsburgh's sister city Wuhan, capital city of Central China's Hubei province.  Such events are great educational opportunities for people who are obsessed with the differences and advocate confrontation between the two countries. I especially liked what Biden said - that China and the US don't see eye to eye on some key issues, but that doesn't mean they should not stop working together.  Increasingly, leaders of the two countries have realized that if they don't work together on key issues, especially important global issues, then it is less likely for them to be resolved and for other countries to come on board. It also means they could waste vital opportunities for cooperation that could benefit the people of the two countries and those beyond.  It was nice to hear Biden say on Tuesday that China should be at the table to help shape rules, particularly because the earlier rhetoric from Obama that ""we, not China, should write the rules"" was quite disturbing, at least from China's perspective. As home to one fifth of humanity, the second-largest economy, the largest trading nation and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China should definitely be at the table to make rules.  People should not be disappointed if they don't see major breakthroughs at the S&ED, because only engagements like this are a necessary and often vital step toward breakthroughs. And that could happen when President Xi Jinping pays his first state visit to the US in September.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "

Some critics of the event have complained about the low productivity of the talks, but given the misunderstanding and mistrust that exist between the two countries, the talks which involve several hundred people from the two governments are extremely important. In fact, there are actually far more people involved, as teams from the two governments prepare for the S&ED throughout the year. Their frequent interaction itself allows them to better communicate with and understand each other.  High-level engagement has been the key to positive momentum in relations between China and the US since President Richard Nixon's icebreaking trip to China in 1972. In the past two years, we have seen a boost to the relationship after President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama met for their ""shirt-sleeves summit"" at the Sunnylands estate in Ranch Mirage, California in June 2013 and agreed to build a new type of major country relationship. Though the US has not been using the term much since then, there is no doubt that such a concept signals the intention for cooperation, not confrontation.  The summit in Beijing last November between Xi and Obama was equally fruitful and far-reaching, when the two countries struck landmark deals on extending business, tourist and student visas, and fighting climate change, among other things.  The same is true with the S&ED. In the past two years, the two countries agreed to start substantive dialogue on the negative list for a Bilateral Investment Treaty, which they exchanged last week in Beijing, and talk on confidence building to avoid dangerous military encounters on the high seas and later in the air.  Some people might think that the South China Sea and cyber security should dominate the agenda this time. The two sides should indeed have a candid talk on such issues, as did last week when visiting Central Military Commission Vice-Chairman Fan Changlong met with US Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other senior US officials.  But at the S&ED, although the two sides should still engage with each other on such complex issues that may not be solved for years in order to prevent them increasing tensions, they should not let such difficult issues eat up the precious time that can be better used talking about ways to increase their cooperation.  The S&ED was established as a major platform to identify new opportunities and manage differences in the bilateral relationship, yet the potential of such opportunities has not been explored as much as they should have been due to the excessive fixation on differences.  Compared with the US, China is still a developing country and it will take a long while for China to catch up. Expecting China to change overnight is just unrealistic. It's just like New Yorkers going to Tennessee or Texas insisting that everything should be as it is in New York. That is not going to happen. Yet that does not mean that New Yorkers and Texans cannot work together to achieve win-win results.  The same is true for China and the US and it has been proved over and over again over the past decades. For example, if the two countries can reach an agreement on the BIT negative list and the air-to-air annex to the code of conduct for military encounters this time, it will inject huge confidence and momentum in the bilateral relationship.  The S&ED is vital for managing differences, but that should not come at the expense of greater efforts to expand cooperation.

More communication brings understanding,6/12/2015,"                      For people concerned that the broad China-US relationship has been hijacked recently by an excessive focus on the South China Sea and cyber security, two events in Washington this week offered welcome relief.  In a talk on Asia-Pacific economic integration at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday, Zhang Jianping, who leads a National Development and Reform Commission think tank, said China is pleased to see the 12 members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement reach consensus. He described the TPP as one of possible passages to the Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific, which China promoted at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing last November.  Zhang was straightforward in saying that countries such as China and Indonesia may not be ready for the TPP, whose membership requirements are well beyond their development stages. There was no talk about a US conspiracy theory to cut China out of the Asia supply chain as argued by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate in economics, and many Chinese experts.  Zhang also extended welcoming arm to the US and Japan to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  While Zhang's words sounded a different note to those who think the TPP is a geopolitical game being played by the US, Kurt Tong, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs at the State Department, also provided a change of tune when he said the US is excited about the prospect of the AIIB. He said it is a good thing that China is providing development capital to the region.  It is true that geopolitics might have played a role in the envisioning of the AIIB and the TPP, and that China and the US may still not see eye-to-eye on the two arrangements, but it seems that neither of them wants to be involved in a lose-lose game.  In this sense, Zhang and Tong have sent a clear message that the two nations are looking to work together despite their differences. It would be great if that kind of message could be reinforced by the two nations' top leaders, not just when they convene for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington later this month or during President Xi Jinping's state visit to the US this fall, but on a more frequent basis.  The clamor about relations between the two countries will reach a crescendo when the 2016 US presidential race goes into full swing late this year. But much of that noise will be the result of ignorance or the lack of mutual understanding.  That is why the US-China Working Group at the House of Representatives, which marked its 10th anniversary on Wednesday, is so admirable. It was launched 10 years ago by Congressmen Rick Larsen from Washington and Mark Kirk from Illinois in a bid to educate US congressmen about China. I still remember interviewing both of them in the US Consulate in Shanghai in 2006 when they made the first visit to China on behalf of the working group.  Kirk, who later became a Senator, helped launch a working group in the Senate in 2013.  Despite the good efforts of the two working groups, there is still a huge gap to fill if US Congressmen, especially freshmen, are to have a nuanced understanding of China and the bilateral relationship.  That could also be true when Chinese Central Military Commission Vice-Chairman Fan Changlong meets with US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Thursday, or when Xi meets US President Barack Obama in Washington this fall.  What has proved effective in the past decade is that more engagement can help the two countries better tap the potential of cooperation and reduce the risk of confrontation. That is something both should strive for.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Small step toward curbing rampant NSA surveillance,6/5/2015,"                              Members of the group of the Greens/European Free Alliance of the European Parliament hold differently coloured portraits of former U.S. spy agency NSA contractor Edward Snowden, during a voting session on the US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programme and its impact on the fundamental rights of European Union (EU) citizens, at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, March 12, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      The US Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to end the unwarranted bulk collection of millions of US citizens' phone records. The so-called USA Freedom Act, first approved by the House of Representatives on May 13, has been hailed by privacy and civil rights groups for reducing government surveillance on the general public. But it has also drawn sharp criticism for not going nearly far enough.  US President Barack Obama immediately signed the legislation. In his address on the weekend, he urged the lawmakers to pass the bill and claimed that the new act will help build confidence among the American people that their privacy and civil liberties are being protected.  Missing in the speeches by Obama and many people supportive of restricting the rampant surveillance by the National Security Agency was any mention of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor whose revelations two years ago resulted in the public outcry against the intrusive government surveillance.  A Pew Research Center report on May 20 says the majority of US citizens believe it is important - often ""very important"" - that they be able to maintain privacy and confidentiality in commonplace activities of their lives.  But without Snowden, Americans and people all over the world would not have been aware of the NSA surveillance which reaches every corner of the world. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff probably would not have known that they were being wiretapped.  Another Pew survey released last July finds widespread worldwide opposition to US eavesdropping and a decline in the view that the US respects the personal freedoms of its own people.  All Americans, including Obama, owe Snowden thanks now that the protection of their privacy has gained growing public attention in an age of national security. Sadly, quite a few US citizens, especially the older generation, still wrongly think that Snowden should be prosecuted.  Indeed, Snowden, now residing in Russia, is still being pursued by the US government as a fugitive. It is puzzling why a great nation like the US would charge someone who has shown such guts for the sake of American people and people all over the world.  It does not look likely that US leaders, such as Obama, will have the guts to admit that it's a mistake to call Snowden a traitor. In most parts of the world, Snowden has been a hero since his revelations were made.  Regardless of the lack of guts on the part of US politicians, the passage of the bill is proof that what Snowden did two years ago was right.  Snowden, who will turn 32 on June 21, has won prizes across the world for his heroic acts that have changed the world. He was even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, a prize that he has proved to be more deserving of than Obama who won it in 2009.  Just hours before the Freedom Act was passed, Snowden told an audience in London via video link from Moscow that ""the things I've received personally and we've all benefited from publicly, make it all worth it,"" referring to his revelations and the hardship he is still in.  There is no doubt that the USA Freedom Act is just the first step in a long march toward curbing NSA's intrusive surveillance. Just imagine, only 1 percent of the documents given by Snowden to the British newspaper, The Guardian, has been made public so far.  Of course, the current bill has not paid tribute to Snowden, and it doesn't address the rampant surveillance against other nations. Before pointing fingers at other nations, the US has to clean up its own mess.  The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA. chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
Washington wants to maintain primacy in Asia Pacific,5/29/2015,"                              A formation of the Nanhai Fleet of China's Navy finished a three-day patrol of the Nansha islands in the South China Sea. [Photo/Xinhua]      Veteran diplomat Fu Ying struck a chord among Chinese when she pointed out the double standards adopted by the United States on the South China Sea issue. Fu told a gathering at the University of Chicago last week that China sees inconsistencies at play. ""When China's neighbors act provocatively on territorial issues, the US turns its head away. Yet when China defends its interests, it is described either as assertive or as a bully,"" said Fu, now chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature.  The US has been making a lot of noise these days about China's land reclamations on some isles and reefs in the South China Sea. US State Department officials have blamed the Chinese for the rising tensions, Pentagon officials have vowed to send military aircraft and vessels to closely patrol the area, while Senator John McCain has said China should not be invited to the 2016 RIMPAC (the Rim of the Pacific Exercise), the world's largest naval war games.  Yet none of them said anything when countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam reclaimed land earlier and on more outposts than China is doing now. US Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear told a Senate hearing two weeks ago that in the Nansha (Spratly) Islands, Vietnam has 48 outposts, the Philippines 8, China 8, Malaysia 5, and China's Taiwan 1.  US officials like to talk about Washington's respect for international laws. But on the law of the seas, China and more than 160 countries are signatories to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, while the US has not ratified it, which speaks volumes of Washington's respect for international laws.  US officials also like to portray China's relations with its South China Sea neighbors as ""coercion"" or ""bullying"", but how coercive and bullying Chinese land reclamations are compared to a superpower flying military jets over and navigating vessels near China's isles or close to its seashores.  The US is the real champion of coercion and bullying if we look at the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the rampant drone strikes that violate the sovereignty of other nations and cause the deaths of innumerable civilians, and its interventions in Libya and Syria. If that is the standard of a bully, China pales into insignificance.  Few will believe that the US has not taken sides in the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Because when it claims to take no sides, it also vows to protect its allies. Does that mean the US will join a war provoked by its allies? The joke in Washington is that the US will have to defend both Japan and the Republic of Korea if a conflict breaks out between the two American allies over their disputed Takeshima/Dokdo Island.  The US has expressed deep concern over the freedom of navigation despite China saying that freedom of navigation has never been an issue in the past and will not be one in the future. China, as the world's largest trading nation, has more at stake when it comes to ensuring the freedom of navigation in its neighborhood.  All these probably explain why the US is ready to mess around in the South China Sea and further complicate the situation even as countries actually involved in the disputes try to agree to a code of conduct through their own efforts.  The true US motive behind all this is its selfish geopolitical goal of maintaining its primacy in the region, which it never wants to be challenged, especially by a rising power like China. It is akin to the selling of Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement to the US Congress and American public for which the Obama administration has to cite geopolitical concerns about a rising China, rather than trade, as the real issue.

Beijing could help fix US infrastructure,5/22/2015,"                              High-speed trains are docked at a commissioning and testing facility of the Tangshan Railway Vehicle Co Ltd which is a subsidiary of the China Northern Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Corporation, in Tangshan city of Hebei province, China, Feb 11 2015. [Photo/IC]      Compared with planes, high-speed trains have increasingly become a preferred choice for people travelling in China. It was simply amazing to cover a distance of close to 1,400 kilometers between Shanghai and Beijing in less than five hours, as I did twice two weeks ago.  Comparatively, it would take Acela, the high-speed Amtrak train, seven hours, to travel the 731 km, between Boston and Washington.  Amtrak has an ambitious blueprint to reduce the Boston-Washington travel time to three hours by 2040, something that Chinese high-speed train can do right now since the designed speed of the line is 380 km/h.  The US used to be admired all over the world for its superb infrastructure, especially the transport network built after the World War II. However, the lack of investment and inadequate maintenance has changed the standing in this regard.  The American Society of Civil Engineers' 2013 Report Card for America's Infrastructure, issued every four years, showed a significant backlog of overdue maintenance, a pressing need for modernization, and an immense opportunity to create reliable, long-term funding. The Report Card gave the US rail system a C+ and both aviations and roads a D. C means mediocre while D means poor.  Over the years, Americans, from President Barack Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden to columnist Thomas Friedman and former US Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy, have sighed at the poor US infrastructure in sharp contrast with the rapid advancement in China.  Potholes on the streets used to be a source of public complaints in China. But Chinese tourists visiting US these days are surprised to find that great US cities such as New York and Washington have more potholes than Chinese cities.  There has been an outcry by Americans about the country's poor infrastructure, especially the rail system, following the May 12 Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured more than 200 others. However, it seems to have died down quickly after just a week.  What's in the news this week is that Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced a $50 billion investment in infrastructure in Brazil, and more investment in the other Latin American countries he is visiting. Such investment has been applauded for rightly addressing the thorny issue of inadequate infrastructure, a key bottleneck to their economic development.  However, Chinese investment in US infrastructure still faces huge hurdles as US politicians demonize such investment as posing a threat to national security.  In an article in the June edition of The Atlantic magazine, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, two former US treasury secretaries, argue that Chinese investors could help the US speed growth now without worsening its long-term debt problem, clearly referring to the more than $18 trillion US national debt.  The US has vast infrastructure needs and a paucity of public capital. But byzantine regulatory and policy barriers too often discourage private investment in major projects. A more streamlined and welcoming environment for domestic and foreign investment in infrastructure projects would create jobs and boost competitiveness, they say in the article, titled Why the US Needs to Listen to China.  Criticizing the two countries for engaging in a dialogue of the deaf and blaming the other for its own failings, they argue that the greatest American threat to China's economic future is the possibility that America's economic success could come to an end. Yet the greatest economic danger China poses to the US is the chance that China's economy fails to grow.  A report on Chinese investment in US Congressional districts released on Wednesday by the National Committee on US-China Relations and Rhodium Group showed Chinese foreign direct investment benefits the recipient economy and creates jobs.  So if US politicians stop fear-mongering, Chinese investment could soon help the US fix its infrastructure problems, such as by building high-speed rails and repairing potholes in New York and Washington.

Growing strategic rivalry distracts from cooperation,5/15/2015,"                              President Xi Jinping meets with his US counterpart Barack Obama on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague on March 24, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      Returning to Washington this week after a month-long vacation in Shanghai, I found myself struggling to adjust, not only because of serious jet lag, but also because of the mood in this political town.  In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, two senior US officials from the State Department and Energy Department tried to convince lawmakers that renewing the bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement is in the best interest of the United States, but some lawmakers seemed unconvinced. They instead voiced their suspicions that China would apply US civil nuclear technology for military purposes and engage in nuclear proliferation.  Bilateral civil nuclear cooperation would be win-win cooperation helping China to develop its civil nuclear power to meet its energy needs and fight climate change, while creating many high-paying US jobs and helping US companies such as Westinghouse from becoming irrelevant to the vast China market.  However, some lawmakers were not aware of this at all.  On Wednesday, the same foreign relations committee held a hearing on the South and East China Seas with testimonies from Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel and Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear. This time, officials and lawmakers were on the same page, a rare phenomenon in Washington: They all blamed China for the tensions in the region.  For Washington, it is only China that is the troublemaker in every dispute and problem. Although, even Shear admitted that some other countries in the region have built far more outposts in the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea.  The Chinese government has successfully solved border issues with 12 countries that share land boundaries with China, all through peaceful and diplomatic means and many with a major compromise by China. But most in the US don't believe that China and its maritime neighbors have the wisdom to solve their territorial disputes by themselves.  It is indeed foolish for anyone to suggest that China would threaten the freedom of navigation in the region, given that the country needs such freedom more than anyone else. Such deep suspicion and distrust of China's intentions have resulted in many books and essays in the US in the past months and years that call for tougher stance against China.  For example, in a 54-page report, Revising US Grand Strategy Toward China, the authors, Robert Blackwill of the Council on Foreign Relations and Ashley Tellis of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, call on Washington to design a new grand strategy toward China that centers on balancing the rise of Chinese power rather than continuing to assist its ascendancy - pretty much a China containment policy.  To Tellis and Blackwill, China and the US are playing a zero sum game. But this is a huge distortion of the reality if you just look at the overall bilateral relationship, from the economy to student exchanges. There are a record of 270,000 Chinese students studying in US colleges and universities.  In Washington, it's often the paranoia about Chinese military modernization that overshadows or hijacks the much larger overall relationship. The same distrust of US intentions is also fast rising among Chinese who see the US as trying to encourage countries to gang up on China.  Lyle Goldstein, author of the book Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the Emerging US-China Rivalry, noted on Tuesday that if China and the US were on the same page, the two largest economies could do a lot of good things together to solve the world's problems.  The pledge made by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama last November to fight climate change is clearly one such example. Yet the two nations' growing obsession with their strategic rivalry has prevented them from realizing the full potential of their relationship.

Embed idealism in constructive realism of ties,4/24/2015,"                              Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, pictured in Sydney in early June. [Agencies]    Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, a fluent Mandarin speaker, shows a clear vision in his latest report, ""US-China 21: The Future of US-China Relations under Xi Jinping"", arguing for a new framework of constructive realism for a common purpose.    Rudd, who claimed to be a global citizen in Shanghai on Wednesday, has the advantage of seeing the picture more objectively, for, as the Chinese saying goes, outsiders see more than insiders (dang ju zhe mi, pang guan zhe qing).  Rudd's argument makes a lot of sense, especially when he recommends a common strategic narrative centered on the concept of ""constructive realism - common purpose"" to guide China-US bilateral relationship.  However, such recommendations sound idealistic given the brutal reality in Washington and Beijing. For example, Rudd has advocated a greater role for China, but Washington's policy is that any greater role for China should be subject to a dominant US role. It would be na?ve to assume this American preoccupation will change anytime soon.  Rudd has also suggested the possibility of a Chinese heading the US-dominated World Bank and Europe-dominated International Monetary Fund. Yet the reality is that the US Congress has refused to endorse even a moderate IMF reform package approved by every other member state.  The recent US stance on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is another indication of how the US is going to handle a greater China role, which, of course, is welcomed by most of US allies.  Is the American Century Over?, the latest book of scholar Joseph Nye, who worked with Rudd on the report at Harvard for the past year, also reflects the mentality that the US should prevent China from playing a dominant role in the world, just as US President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the US, instead of China, should write the rules.  Unfortunately, these are not minority views or even the worst views in the US. Rudd expressed concern over the White House being advised by people like David Shambaugh who recently propounded the ""China collapse"" fallacy. There is the almighty military industry complex, which profits from tensions and conflicts in the world, the dysfunctional Capitol Hill where many lawmakers reveal their ignorance at hearings on China and many lobbying firms which are paid by interest groups to demonize China.  Sadly, how US political leaders flirt with China-US relations will be on full display later this year when the US presidential campaign heats up. China has traditionally been a bogeyman for American politicians and anyone talking sense regarding China, like Jon Huntsman, who is not adept at US politics, would not survive the primaries. Whatever the presidential candidates say this year, they are likely to be a major departure from Rudd's recommendations.  On the Chinese side, too, there are hawks and nationalistic groups that are unlikely to subscribe to Rudd's recommendations. Rudd is not sure if policymakers in the two capitals will endorse his recommendations. He has said that, whether or not they should be adopted by the two governments is for a matter for them to decide. He is just providing a vision.  He believes political will is required to fulfill such a vision and national leaders like Xi and Obama have the power to do that.  The question is whether such leaders will use their political capital to make right the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century. Such political vision distinguishes a great leader from an ordinary one. It's time Beijing and Washington both embraced the idealism embedded in Rudd's constructive realism, instead of just applauding it.

Shambaugh fails to defend his position,4/10/2015,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with US President Barack Obama during the APEC Welcome Banquet at the Beijing National Aquatics Center, or the Water Cube, in Beijing on Nov 10, 2014. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters      I didn't realize I would be missed so much so soon after leaving Washington for my home in Shanghai for holidays. Just hours after landing in Shanghai on April 2, a fellow journalist sent me a message via instant messaging service WeChat, saying David Shambaugh mentioned my name multiple times that day during his talk at George Washington University.  The talk, which I listened to days later on the Internet, was largely a crisis management for his March 7 article in The Wall Street Journal titled ""The Coming Chinese Crackup"", in which he declared the ""endgame of the Communist rule"" in China had begun.  Compared with his much criticized one-sided views in the WSJ, Shambaugh was a bit more balanced on April 2 despite his continued pessimism in China's future and his prediction that the Communist rule would end 20 years from now.  Yet the 10 challenges facing China according to Shambaugh in his talk - China at the Crossroads - are nothing new. From economic reforms, corruption to income inequality, they have been mentioned in the annual Government Work Report for years. Just a month ago, Premier Li Keqiang presented a far more comprehensive outline of the challenges in his report. Even a Beijing cab driver could elaborate some of the challenges facing the country.  The good thing, as Shambaugh admitted this time, is that top leaders are aware of these problems and taking steps to address them. But who would be naive enough to assume that a large developing country, with a population four times that of the United States and per capita GDP ranking around 90th in the world, will be free of big challenges anytime soon?  Shambaugh defended his WSJ article by blaming the newspaper for giving it a sensational headline. He said his article should be judged by its content, not title. But most people who have read his article would not endorse his conclusion based merely on random and superficial evidence. And among those people are some of the sharpest critics of China in US think tanks.           "
Abe should clarify his views on history,4/3/2015,"                              US Army General Martin Dempsey (L), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the start of their talks at Abe's official residence in Tokyo March 25, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]      Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been invited to address a joint session of US Congress on April 29 during his eight-day visit to the United States. The right-wing politician will be the first Japanese prime minister to do so.  The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner on March 26, said ""his address will provide an opportunity for the American people to hear from one of our closest allies about ways we can expand our cooperation on economic and security priorities"".  Missing was any mention of Abe using the opportunity to clarify his highly controversial views on history, as the world and the United Nations prepare to observe the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II later this year. Abe's revisionist views on history have angered many in China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, and other Asian countries that suffered the brutality of Japanese militarism before and during WWII.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged Japan to face history squarely while ROK Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se has said Japan will risk ""severe damage"" to its leadership if it misses important opportunities on the horizon to own up to its war crimes. Yun was referring to Abe's scheduled address to the US Congress and a declaration he is expected to make on WWII in August.  Abe has made many controversial remarks. He has questioned whether WWII constituted aggression on the part of Japan and denied that the Japanese military was responsible for the ""comfort women"" - Asian women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army.  Not just Chinese and Koreans are closely watching Abe. Writing last week to the Veterans' Committees of both houses of the US Congress, Jan Thompson, president of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial Society, which represents surviving US prisoners of the Japanese army during WWII, said that past statements by Abe rejecting the verdicts of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal that served as the foundation of the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan ""trouble us"".

US about-face on AIIB would be welcomed,3/27/2015,"                              China's President Xi Jinping (4th R) meets with the guests at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) launch ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in this October 24, 2014 file photograph. [Photo/Agencies]      The past week has seen a major shift in US attitudes towards the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Nathan Sheets told the Wall Street Journal that the United States welcomes new multilateral institutions that strengthen the international financial architecture. He also hoped that the AIIB would co-finance projects with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.  This was welcome progress given the rhetoric from several US officials just a week ago. In his testimony before the US Congress last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew continued to express deep doubt about AIIB's standards on governance, transparency, corruption, labor and environment.  For months, US officials have been pressuring the country's allies to stay away from AIIB, but the decision by its key European allies to apply to join as founding members has sent a clear message that they are no longer Washington's poodles. South Korea, a country that has been heavily pressured by the US, just announced its hard decision on Thursday to join AIIB. Australia, which is feeling the brunt of US pressure, is very likely to apply before the March 31 deadline.  US leaders have for years said Asia-Pacific nations do not have to choose between China and the US, yet its pressure on its allies to resist the AIIB has served to show this is not the case.  If Washington wants to add substance to those words, it needs to stop pressurizing Australia, South Korea and Japan not to join the AIIB. These three countries are important members of the Asia-Pacific community and should not be left out of a multilateral institution like the AIIB. The AIIB, which aspires to pool resources to fund much needed infrastructure projects in the region, will be a win-win institution for all nations.  The World Bank and Asian Development Bank can only meet a fraction of the huge need for funds for infrastructure in the region, so there is ample room for the AIIB. That is why World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and ADB President Takehiko Nakao have not only extended welcoming arms, they are also seeking to partner their organizations with the AIIB.

On Tuesday, at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, a group of so-called experts were discussing the implication of the emerging anti-access/area-denial capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The views of most countries, from Singapore and Thailand to Vietnam and the Philippines, were presented. Yet not only was there no speaker from China, which was the focal point of the talk, but also none of the panelists mentioned the Chinese perspective.  Instead, the three panelists, two with a Pentagon background and the third having once worked for the Japanese embassy in Washington, described how China with its growing military power poses a threat to the US and every other country in the region. One said China could shoot down satellites, while another asserted that China could use its missiles to attack Japan. They then started to emphasize how every country in the region is scared of China and seeking help from the US.  Sitting 3 meters from the podium, I probably should have been worried about my safety in case one of the panelists ran amok and threw a chair at me. Fortunately, I don't suffer from the same paranoia the panelists exihibited. The only thing I did was to tell them that using their logic, the US, with its advanced weaponry, could attack every country and destroy the planet 10 times, if not 100 times, over.  If the Chinese suffered from the same paranoia, the just-concluded annual session of the National People's Congress, the top legislature, should have raised China's military spending by 50 percent this year, instead of just 10 percent, which is less than the increase in 2014.  Even if China's A2/AD strategy exists, it is defensive in nature, while the US Air Sea Battle, renamed this year as the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC) is offensive and preemptive. However, the panel didn't touch on this.           "
Shambaugh China essay in shambles,3/13/2015,"                              Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of Central Military Commission, speaks during a conference on the diplomatic work on neighboring countries in Beijing, Oct 25, 2013. [Photo/Xinhua]      In the 1990s, some American scholars and journalists indulged themselves in forecasting a China collapse into several republics, like the Soviet Union. Some based their arguments on the growing regionalism in the country, others bet on the passing away of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.  To their disappointment, China has not disintegrated into six or seven republics. Instead it has become the world's second-largest economy and it is well on its way to being No 1.  Yet the rise of China has not discouraged some in the United States from continuing to fantasize about the breakup of China.  In his Wall Street Journal article ""The Coming Chinese Crackup"" on March 7, David Shambaugh, a China scholar at George Washington University, pronounced that the ""endgame of Communist rule"" in China has begun. But his article is based on some random and superficial facts, and his arguments can best be summarized as yipian gaiquan, (hasty generalization), or the English idiom - One swallow does not make a summer.  Shambaugh is right that no campaign can eliminate the problem of corruption. But no one should be so na?ve as to believe that corruption can be completely uprooted, either in China or in the US, where President Barack Obama has repeatedly complained about money in politics.  Shambaugh's deep flaw is that he looked at China with a bias, completely ignoring the positive aspects.  For example, the anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping has raised hope for many Chinese that the thorny issue is being tackled. The campaign has been popular both at home and abroad, including winning support from senior Obama administration officials and many China scholars in Washington. In the past days, US scholars, both on the right and left, have questioned Shambaugh's logic.  I believe Xi and many Chinese know that fighting the war on corruption is really hard. Yet Shambaugh seems to suggest that doing nothing is probably a better way forward.           "
Turning a blind eye to faults is not love,2/27/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama (R) participates in the taping of an MSNBC/Telemundo town hall discussion on immigration with host Jose Diaz-Balart (L) at Florida International University in Miami, February 25, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      People in the United States have been engaging in a debate of whether President Barack Obama loves America. It was a debate triggered by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani who claimed on Feb 18 that ""I do not believe the president loves America.""  It's a conversation that probably no other country would conduct. You do not hear the British questioning if David Cameron loves the United Kingdom or Germans asking if Angela Merkel loves Germany.  Ironically, it is a debate that has arisen after Obama has served as president for more than six years. What seems more absurd is the latest survey conducted on Feb 22 and 23 by the polling company Rasmussen Reports, which found that 35 percent of likely US voters agree with Giuliani's statement.  Unlike those in many countries, US politicians never forget to eulogize their country in their public speeches, such as by saying that the US is the greatest country ever in human history, as if this is the best and only way to prove that they love their country.  Whenever I heard such a statement in the past two years, it reminded me of the character Will McAvoy in the 2012 TV series Newsroom. A TV anchor, he certainly does not love America using Giuliani's criteria because Will said loud and clear that the US is not the greatest country in the world.  For those who haven't watched the 25-episode series, here is a brief recount of Will's answer. ""There is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined...""

"China may not have allies, but it has many friends",2/13/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, September 18, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      It's puzzling to hear some Americans, such as CNN journalist-analyst Fareed Zakaria, say that China has no friends. If that is true, how come the Chinese mainland, along with France, the United States and Spain, is one of most preferred destinations of international tourists? If the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are included, China is by far the most favored tourist destination.  Just a year ago, China overtook the US to become the world's largest trading country. China is already the largest trading partner of 124 nations; the number for the US is 76. And 2014 figures show it has surpassed the US as the top destination for foreign direct investment.  Do these facts suggest China has no friends? If not, why do Western observers have the wrong idea? Actually, what Western observers mean by ""China has no friends"" is that ""China has no allies bound by security treaties"". But nobody can say China has no friends.  China was allies with the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during the Cold War. Bur since the end of the Cold War, China has followed a foreign policy of non-alignment.  Beijing strongly believes that since the Cold War is over, the concept of allies, which has its roots in the Cold War, should end too. Yet for some Americans, the Cold War is still on.  That probably explains why the US still maintains hundreds of military bases and deploys about a quarter million military personnel at its overseas bases, including those built after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks. The US has used these bases to launch wars on many countries, including a dozen in the Middle East since the 1980s.  In 1999, Washington, bypassing the United Nations, led NATO forces to carry out an 11-week bombing on Kosovo. Four years later, it used the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq to topple then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein on the pretext that he had stocked weapons of mass destruction. And in 2011, it violated a UN resolution on no-fly zone over Libya to help Western forces topple former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi.           "
US military spending will never be enough,2/6/2015,"                              From left: Former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright testify before the US Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday about global challenges and US national security strategy. Chen Weihua / China Daily      The US national debt clock near Times Square was ticking in the $16-trillion range when I left New York two years ago. On Tuesday, it had crossed $18.102 trillion. This means that each of the 319 million Americans owes a debt of more than $56,000.  The US national debt was only $5.6 trillion in 2000; it crossed the $10-trillion mark in 2008. And since Sept 30, 2012, it has been climbing by about $2.38 billion a day.  I don't remember seeing such a glaring screen in Washington, where politicians are debating US President Barack Obama's $4 trillion record-breaking budget for 2016, including $585 billion in defense spending. While Obama has repeatedly claimed the US has ended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US defense budget request is 4 percent higher than the previous year, with Obama seeking more money to produce F-35 fighter jets, submarines, long-range bombers and missile defense systems.  The US' monstrous defense spending is more than the combined amount of the next top 10 countries. But in Washington, the rhetoric has been that the US is facing threats from the Islamic State group, and Russia and China, a typical excuse for interest groups to hijack the defense budget and, along with it, the American people.  Early this week, US Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work defended the increase in the defense budget saying that ""our defense strategy will become brittle and more prone to breaking"".  At a Jan 28 US congressional hearing, the group of joint chiefs presented their cases. Some said the US was falling behind its potential adversaries, while others complained the US now had the smallest air force ever. Of course, in 2012 we all heard former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney describe the US Navy as the smallest since 1917.  These are attempts to whitewash reality unless you think a Hellfire missile, which costs some $110,000 each, is the same as a bullet, or an F-35, which costs $140 million each, is the same as an amphibian floatplane used in World War II.

US State of the Union address smacks of China bashing,1/30/2015,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping (L3) attends the joint opening ceremony of the Sixth Round of China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the Fifth Round of China-US High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange in Beijing, capital of China, July 9, 2014. [Photo by Xu Jingxing/chinadaily.com.cn]      There is no doubt US politicians have not talked enough with their people about the positive aspects of US-China ties, which accounts for a large part of the full picture of bilateral relations. On the contrary, they have made increasing use of China as a bogeyman.  We saw that when incumbent US president Barack Obama battled Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign on who was and could be tougher on China, making it seem the US could solve its problems by just blaming China. We saw it again last week when Obama gave his State of the Union address.  While several experts on US-China relations I talked with earlier did not even expect China to come up in the address this year, because they believed it would focus on domestic issues, Obama sprang a big surprise. The Republicans surely didn't expect to see a cockier-than-ever Obama speaking for the first time before a Congress with both chambers controlled by the Republicans. He touched on bipartisan cooperation, but the words and tone he used were absolutely confrontational.  Obama knew that using China as a bogeyman was his best shot to convince Republicans who don't see eye to eye with him. So he sensationally alleged: ""China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage."" And followed it up with his solution: ""Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules.""  The fact of the matter is that China has not been part of the US-dominated rule making in the past. And now Obama wants to exclude it from future rule making as well. If the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership is not a scheme to contain China's rise, Obama's way of arguing for Trade Promotion Authority from US Congress indeed suggests it is.           "
West should end its hypocrisy on anti-terror war,1/22/2015,"                              Chinese and Russian policemen attend a joint anti-terror drill in Manzhouli City, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Oct 20, 2014. [Photo/Xinhua]      Senior US leaders invited sharp criticism at home for not attending last week's solidarity rally in Paris against the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in which 12 people were killed. As a result, US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Paris this week to make up for the mistake.  However, terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters killed hundreds of, if not more, ordinary people early this month, have not received the same attention in the US and the Western world as the Paris attack. Yet such double standards and hypocrisy of the Western world is nothing new.  Over the past few years, the US and some Western countries have not responded to the terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in Beijing, Kunming and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region the way they reacted to the Paris attack.  On several occasions, US State Department spokespersons have used the excuse that they need more information and investigation into the incidents in China to condemn them as terrorist attacks. But they did not ask any such question after the Paris attack.  Some Western news organizations have refused to describe the perpetrators at Kunming railway station in Yunnan province as terrorists, insisting on calling them ""knife-wielding attackers"". And on the rare occasions that they have used the word terrorist, they put it within quotation marks as if the ruthless killers in China were any different from those in Paris or elsewhere in the Western world. One CNN report even posed the question, ""Terrorism or Cry of Desperation?"", as if killing innocent civilians in China can be somehow justified.  Even though China and the US have common interests in fighting terrorism, some Americans still seem to believe that only those setting off bombs in New York are terrorists while those doing the same in Beijing or any other Chinese city demand a different description.

Some Americans yet to wake up from Cold War,1/15/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama speaks at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, December 15, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Barack Obama announced on Dec 17 that he would pursue normalization of relations with Cuba, the island country only 144 kilometers from Key West in Florida, ending the 54-year-old US embargo, but many Americans are still living in the Cold War.  Though Obama's decision has been applauded internationally, many within the US have criticized him for appeasing the communist government in Cuba and undermining the cause of freedom and democracy there. There have been plenty of op-eds on these lines in mainstream US media in the past four weeks.  Indeed, Obama faces a tough battle to make good his announcement, for he needs the help of Republican-controlled Congress to lift the embargo with powerful people such as Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, standing in the way.  Having made three trips to Cuba in the past four years, I too am a critic of Obama, but for making the move far too late.  In 2004 as a state Senator from Illinois, Obama had criticized the ""failed"" US policy on Cuba. So when he became president in 2009, many hoped he would change it. But it took him six long years to make the move, to the disappointment of many. In a sense, Obama let the ""failed"" policy extend for six more years.  Contrary to popular belief that lifting of the embargo would only benefit the Cubans, the new policy will end the US' isolation in the United Nations General Assembly, which has been condemning the inhuman embargo almost unanimously every fall. Also, it will help ease the anger of many Latin American countries over the absurd US policy that outlived the Cold War by a quarter century.  Obama is absolutely right as the rest of the world has known for a long time - that the US policy on Cuba has been a miserable failure. However, the new Cuba policy has not succeeded in awakening some Obama supporters from the Cold War. In fact, quite a few of them want to turn the new policy into one that increases US presence in Cuba to counter Chinese and Russian participation there.           "
Embed idealism in constructive realism of ties,4/24/2015,"                              Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, pictured in Sydney in early June. [Agencies]    Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, a fluent Mandarin speaker, shows a clear vision in his latest report, ""US-China 21: The Future of US-China Relations under Xi Jinping"", arguing for a new framework of constructive realism for a common purpose.    Rudd, who claimed to be a global citizen in Shanghai on Wednesday, has the advantage of seeing the picture more objectively, for, as the Chinese saying goes, outsiders see more than insiders (dang ju zhe mi, pang guan zhe qing).  Rudd's argument makes a lot of sense, especially when he recommends a common strategic narrative centered on the concept of ""constructive realism - common purpose"" to guide China-US bilateral relationship.  However, such recommendations sound idealistic given the brutal reality in Washington and Beijing. For example, Rudd has advocated a greater role for China, but Washington's policy is that any greater role for China should be subject to a dominant US role. It would be na?ve to assume this American preoccupation will change anytime soon.  Rudd has also suggested the possibility of a Chinese heading the US-dominated World Bank and Europe-dominated International Monetary Fund. Yet the reality is that the US Congress has refused to endorse even a moderate IMF reform package approved by every other member state.  The recent US stance on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is another indication of how the US is going to handle a greater China role, which, of course, is welcomed by most of US allies.  Is the American Century Over?, the latest book of scholar Joseph Nye, who worked with Rudd on the report at Harvard for the past year, also reflects the mentality that the US should prevent China from playing a dominant role in the world, just as US President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the US, instead of China, should write the rules.  Unfortunately, these are not minority views or even the worst views in the US. Rudd expressed concern over the White House being advised by people like David Shambaugh who recently propounded the ""China collapse"" fallacy. There is the almighty military industry complex, which profits from tensions and conflicts in the world, the dysfunctional Capitol Hill where many lawmakers reveal their ignorance at hearings on China and many lobbying firms which are paid by interest groups to demonize China.  Sadly, how US political leaders flirt with China-US relations will be on full display later this year when the US presidential campaign heats up. China has traditionally been a bogeyman for American politicians and anyone talking sense regarding China, like Jon Huntsman, who is not adept at US politics, would not survive the primaries. Whatever the presidential candidates say this year, they are likely to be a major departure from Rudd's recommendations.  On the Chinese side, too, there are hawks and nationalistic groups that are unlikely to subscribe to Rudd's recommendations. Rudd is not sure if policymakers in the two capitals will endorse his recommendations. He has said that, whether or not they should be adopted by the two governments is for a matter for them to decide. He is just providing a vision.  He believes political will is required to fulfill such a vision and national leaders like Xi and Obama have the power to do that.  The question is whether such leaders will use their political capital to make right the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century. Such political vision distinguishes a great leader from an ordinary one. It's time Beijing and Washington both embraced the idealism embedded in Rudd's constructive realism, instead of just applauding it.

Shambaugh fails to defend his position,4/10/2015,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with US President Barack Obama during the APEC Welcome Banquet at the Beijing National Aquatics Center, or the Water Cube, in Beijing on Nov 10, 2014. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters      I didn't realize I would be missed so much so soon after leaving Washington for my home in Shanghai for holidays. Just hours after landing in Shanghai on April 2, a fellow journalist sent me a message via instant messaging service WeChat, saying David Shambaugh mentioned my name multiple times that day during his talk at George Washington University.  The talk, which I listened to days later on the Internet, was largely a crisis management for his March 7 article in The Wall Street Journal titled ""The Coming Chinese Crackup"", in which he declared the ""endgame of the Communist rule"" in China had begun.  Compared with his much criticized one-sided views in the WSJ, Shambaugh was a bit more balanced on April 2 despite his continued pessimism in China's future and his prediction that the Communist rule would end 20 years from now.  Yet the 10 challenges facing China according to Shambaugh in his talk - China at the Crossroads - are nothing new. From economic reforms, corruption to income inequality, they have been mentioned in the annual Government Work Report for years. Just a month ago, Premier Li Keqiang presented a far more comprehensive outline of the challenges in his report. Even a Beijing cab driver could elaborate some of the challenges facing the country.  The good thing, as Shambaugh admitted this time, is that top leaders are aware of these problems and taking steps to address them. But who would be naive enough to assume that a large developing country, with a population four times that of the United States and per capita GDP ranking around 90th in the world, will be free of big challenges anytime soon?  Shambaugh defended his WSJ article by blaming the newspaper for giving it a sensational headline. He said his article should be judged by its content, not title. But most people who have read his article would not endorse his conclusion based merely on random and superficial evidence. And among those people are some of the sharpest critics of China in US think tanks.           "
Abe should clarify his views on history,4/3/2015,"                              US Army General Martin Dempsey (L), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the start of their talks at Abe's official residence in Tokyo March 25, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]      Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been invited to address a joint session of US Congress on April 29 during his eight-day visit to the United States. The right-wing politician will be the first Japanese prime minister to do so.  The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner on March 26, said ""his address will provide an opportunity for the American people to hear from one of our closest allies about ways we can expand our cooperation on economic and security priorities"".  Missing was any mention of Abe using the opportunity to clarify his highly controversial views on history, as the world and the United Nations prepare to observe the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II later this year. Abe's revisionist views on history have angered many in China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, and other Asian countries that suffered the brutality of Japanese militarism before and during WWII.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged Japan to face history squarely while ROK Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se has said Japan will risk ""severe damage"" to its leadership if it misses important opportunities on the horizon to own up to its war crimes. Yun was referring to Abe's scheduled address to the US Congress and a declaration he is expected to make on WWII in August.  Abe has made many controversial remarks. He has questioned whether WWII constituted aggression on the part of Japan and denied that the Japanese military was responsible for the ""comfort women"" - Asian women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army.  Not just Chinese and Koreans are closely watching Abe. Writing last week to the Veterans' Committees of both houses of the US Congress, Jan Thompson, president of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial Society, which represents surviving US prisoners of the Japanese army during WWII, said that past statements by Abe rejecting the verdicts of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal that served as the foundation of the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan ""trouble us"".

US about-face on AIIB would be welcomed,3/27/2015,"                              China's President Xi Jinping (4th R) meets with the guests at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) launch ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in this October 24, 2014 file photograph. [Photo/Agencies]      The past week has seen a major shift in US attitudes towards the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Nathan Sheets told the Wall Street Journal that the United States welcomes new multilateral institutions that strengthen the international financial architecture. He also hoped that the AIIB would co-finance projects with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.  This was welcome progress given the rhetoric from several US officials just a week ago. In his testimony before the US Congress last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew continued to express deep doubt about AIIB's standards on governance, transparency, corruption, labor and environment.  For months, US officials have been pressuring the country's allies to stay away from AIIB, but the decision by its key European allies to apply to join as founding members has sent a clear message that they are no longer Washington's poodles. South Korea, a country that has been heavily pressured by the US, just announced its hard decision on Thursday to join AIIB. Australia, which is feeling the brunt of US pressure, is very likely to apply before the March 31 deadline.  US leaders have for years said Asia-Pacific nations do not have to choose between China and the US, yet its pressure on its allies to resist the AIIB has served to show this is not the case.  If Washington wants to add substance to those words, it needs to stop pressurizing Australia, South Korea and Japan not to join the AIIB. These three countries are important members of the Asia-Pacific community and should not be left out of a multilateral institution like the AIIB. The AIIB, which aspires to pool resources to fund much needed infrastructure projects in the region, will be a win-win institution for all nations.  The World Bank and Asian Development Bank can only meet a fraction of the huge need for funds for infrastructure in the region, so there is ample room for the AIIB. That is why World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and ADB President Takehiko Nakao have not only extended welcoming arms, they are also seeking to partner their organizations with the AIIB.

Yet Shambaugh seems to suggest that doing nothing is probably a better way forward.           "
Turning a blind eye to faults is not love,2/27/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama (R) participates in the taping of an MSNBC/Telemundo town hall discussion on immigration with host Jose Diaz-Balart (L) at Florida International University in Miami, February 25, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]      People in the United States have been engaging in a debate of whether President Barack Obama loves America. It was a debate triggered by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani who claimed on Feb 18 that ""I do not believe the president loves America.""  It's a conversation that probably no other country would conduct. You do not hear the British questioning if David Cameron loves the United Kingdom or Germans asking if Angela Merkel loves Germany.  Ironically, it is a debate that has arisen after Obama has served as president for more than six years. What seems more absurd is the latest survey conducted on Feb 22 and 23 by the polling company Rasmussen Reports, which found that 35 percent of likely US voters agree with Giuliani's statement.  Unlike those in many countries, US politicians never forget to eulogize their country in their public speeches, such as by saying that the US is the greatest country ever in human history, as if this is the best and only way to prove that they love their country.  Whenever I heard such a statement in the past two years, it reminded me of the character Will McAvoy in the 2012 TV series Newsroom. A TV anchor, he certainly does not love America using Giuliani's criteria because Will said loud and clear that the US is not the greatest country in the world.  For those who haven't watched the 25-episode series, here is a brief recount of Will's answer. ""There is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined...""

"China may not have allies, but it has many friends",2/13/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, September 18, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      It's puzzling to hear some Americans, such as CNN journalist-analyst Fareed Zakaria, say that China has no friends. If that is true, how come the Chinese mainland, along with France, the United States and Spain, is one of most preferred destinations of international tourists? If the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are included, China is by far the most favored tourist destination.  Just a year ago, China overtook the US to become the world's largest trading country. China is already the largest trading partner of 124 nations; the number for the US is 76. And 2014 figures show it has surpassed the US as the top destination for foreign direct investment.  Do these facts suggest China has no friends? If not, why do Western observers have the wrong idea? Actually, what Western observers mean by ""China has no friends"" is that ""China has no allies bound by security treaties"". But nobody can say China has no friends.  China was allies with the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during the Cold War. Bur since the end of the Cold War, China has followed a foreign policy of non-alignment.  Beijing strongly believes that since the Cold War is over, the concept of allies, which has its roots in the Cold War, should end too. Yet for some Americans, the Cold War is still on.  That probably explains why the US still maintains hundreds of military bases and deploys about a quarter million military personnel at its overseas bases, including those built after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks. The US has used these bases to launch wars on many countries, including a dozen in the Middle East since the 1980s.  In 1999, Washington, bypassing the United Nations, led NATO forces to carry out an 11-week bombing on Kosovo. Four years later, it used the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq to topple then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein on the pretext that he had stocked weapons of mass destruction. And in 2011, it violated a UN resolution on no-fly zone over Libya to help Western forces topple former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi.           "
US military spending will never be enough,2/6/2015,"                              From left: Former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright testify before the US Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday about global challenges and US national security strategy. Chen Weihua / China Daily      The US national debt clock near Times Square was ticking in the $16-trillion range when I left New York two years ago. On Tuesday, it had crossed $18.102 trillion. This means that each of the 319 million Americans owes a debt of more than $56,000.  The US national debt was only $5.6 trillion in 2000; it crossed the $10-trillion mark in 2008. And since Sept 30, 2012, it has been climbing by about $2.38 billion a day.  I don't remember seeing such a glaring screen in Washington, where politicians are debating US President Barack Obama's $4 trillion record-breaking budget for 2016, including $585 billion in defense spending. While Obama has repeatedly claimed the US has ended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US defense budget request is 4 percent higher than the previous year, with Obama seeking more money to produce F-35 fighter jets, submarines, long-range bombers and missile defense systems.  The US' monstrous defense spending is more than the combined amount of the next top 10 countries. But in Washington, the rhetoric has been that the US is facing threats from the Islamic State group, and Russia and China, a typical excuse for interest groups to hijack the defense budget and, along with it, the American people.  Early this week, US Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work defended the increase in the defense budget saying that ""our defense strategy will become brittle and more prone to breaking"".  At a Jan 28 US congressional hearing, the group of joint chiefs presented their cases. Some said the US was falling behind its potential adversaries, while others complained the US now had the smallest air force ever. Of course, in 2012 we all heard former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney describe the US Navy as the smallest since 1917.  These are attempts to whitewash reality unless you think a Hellfire missile, which costs some $110,000 each, is the same as a bullet, or an F-35, which costs $140 million each, is the same as an amphibian floatplane used in World War II.

US State of the Union address smacks of China bashing,1/30/2015,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping (L3) attends the joint opening ceremony of the Sixth Round of China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the Fifth Round of China-US High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange in Beijing, capital of China, July 9, 2014. [Photo by Xu Jingxing/chinadaily.com.cn]      There is no doubt US politicians have not talked enough with their people about the positive aspects of US-China ties, which accounts for a large part of the full picture of bilateral relations. On the contrary, they have made increasing use of China as a bogeyman.  We saw that when incumbent US president Barack Obama battled Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign on who was and could be tougher on China, making it seem the US could solve its problems by just blaming China. We saw it again last week when Obama gave his State of the Union address.  While several experts on US-China relations I talked with earlier did not even expect China to come up in the address this year, because they believed it would focus on domestic issues, Obama sprang a big surprise. The Republicans surely didn't expect to see a cockier-than-ever Obama speaking for the first time before a Congress with both chambers controlled by the Republicans. He touched on bipartisan cooperation, but the words and tone he used were absolutely confrontational.  Obama knew that using China as a bogeyman was his best shot to convince Republicans who don't see eye to eye with him. So he sensationally alleged: ""China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage."" And followed it up with his solution: ""Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules.""  The fact of the matter is that China has not been part of the US-dominated rule making in the past. And now Obama wants to exclude it from future rule making as well. If the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership is not a scheme to contain China's rise, Obama's way of arguing for Trade Promotion Authority from US Congress indeed suggests it is.           "
West should end its hypocrisy on anti-terror war,1/22/2015,"                              Chinese and Russian policemen attend a joint anti-terror drill in Manzhouli City, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Oct 20, 2014. [Photo/Xinhua]      Senior US leaders invited sharp criticism at home for not attending last week's solidarity rally in Paris against the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in which 12 people were killed. As a result, US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Paris this week to make up for the mistake.  However, terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters killed hundreds of, if not more, ordinary people early this month, have not received the same attention in the US and the Western world as the Paris attack. Yet such double standards and hypocrisy of the Western world is nothing new.  Over the past few years, the US and some Western countries have not responded to the terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in Beijing, Kunming and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region the way they reacted to the Paris attack.  On several occasions, US State Department spokespersons have used the excuse that they need more information and investigation into the incidents in China to condemn them as terrorist attacks. But they did not ask any such question after the Paris attack.  Some Western news organizations have refused to describe the perpetrators at Kunming railway station in Yunnan province as terrorists, insisting on calling them ""knife-wielding attackers"". And on the rare occasions that they have used the word terrorist, they put it within quotation marks as if the ruthless killers in China were any different from those in Paris or elsewhere in the Western world. One CNN report even posed the question, ""Terrorism or Cry of Desperation?"", as if killing innocent civilians in China can be somehow justified.  Even though China and the US have common interests in fighting terrorism, some Americans still seem to believe that only those setting off bombs in New York are terrorists while those doing the same in Beijing or any other Chinese city demand a different description.

Some Americans yet to wake up from Cold War,1/15/2015,"                              US President Barack Obama speaks at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, December 15, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]      US President Barack Obama announced on Dec 17 that he would pursue normalization of relations with Cuba, the island country only 144 kilometers from Key West in Florida, ending the 54-year-old US embargo, but many Americans are still living in the Cold War.  Though Obama's decision has been applauded internationally, many within the US have criticized him for appeasing the communist government in Cuba and undermining the cause of freedom and democracy there. There have been plenty of op-eds on these lines in mainstream US media in the past four weeks.  Indeed, Obama faces a tough battle to make good his announcement, for he needs the help of Republican-controlled Congress to lift the embargo with powerful people such as Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, standing in the way.  Having made three trips to Cuba in the past four years, I too am a critic of Obama, but for making the move far too late.  In 2004 as a state Senator from Illinois, Obama had criticized the ""failed"" US policy on Cuba. So when he became president in 2009, many hoped he would change it. But it took him six long years to make the move, to the disappointment of many. In a sense, Obama let the ""failed"" policy extend for six more years.  Contrary to popular belief that lifting of the embargo would only benefit the Cubans, the new policy will end the US' isolation in the United Nations General Assembly, which has been condemning the inhuman embargo almost unanimously every fall. Also, it will help ease the anger of many Latin American countries over the absurd US policy that outlived the Cold War by a quarter century.  Obama is absolutely right as the rest of the world has known for a long time - that the US policy on Cuba has been a miserable failure. However, the new Cuba policy has not succeeded in awakening some Obama supporters from the Cold War. In fact, quite a few of them want to turn the new policy into one that increases US presence in Cuba to counter Chinese and Russian participation there.           "
US should respect sovereignty of others,9/25/2014,"                      US President Barack Obama likes to talk about international laws and respect for other nations' sovereignty, but he himself violated it blatantly on Tuesday when he ordered airstrikes in Syria.  The fact that the airstrikes were not invited or approved by the Syrian government or endorsed by the United Nations Security Council proved that there is no legal basis for the US military actions.  Eleven years ago, before then-president George W. Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, he at least sent his secretary of state Colin Powell to lobby the United Nations first, albeit with false evidence in his hand.  Obama did not bother to try and get approval from the UN before bombing a sovereign nation. Instead, he chose to go to the UN only after the strikes. Such an action shows gross disrespect for international law.  If the action by the Bush administration set a bad precedent, Obama, who opposed and criticized the Iraq War, is setting another horrible precedent. From now on, any big and powerful nation can launch airstrikes in another nation to pursue so-called hostile elements by just notifying its government and not getting its agreement or asking the UN Security Council for a green light. The words of Jennifer Psaki, the US State Department's spokeswoman on Tuesday clearly reflected such disregard for another country's sovereignty. She said the US informed the Syrian regime directly of the US intent to take action through the US ambassador to UN.  ""We warned Syria not to engage US aircraft. We did not request the regime's permission,"" Psaki said.  It's not a surprise that the US has so far garnered little support for its military action in Syria. Although it has tried to show legitimacy by highlighting the five Arab states which participated in Tuesday's action, it cannot hide the fact that even its closest allies, such as Britain and France, have chosen not to participate in the strikes in Syria, partly out of the concern for the lack of legitimacy.  In fact, Obama didn't even get overwhelming support from his own Democrats for his strategy, as 85 Democrat House members last week voted against his proposals to arm Syrian rebels in the fight against the IS group, because of their concerns about it escalating into an open-ended war.  What is ironic is that Obama, in stressing the five Arab states, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, that participated in the strikes, did not emphasize as usual that it is a coalition based on common values of freedom and democracy, because clearly it isn't.  What is even more ironic is that the IS extremists received funding from wealthy donors in some of these Arab states in their bid to topple the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The US itself also helped train IS members in Jordan in the past years in a covert operation to finance, train and arm Syrian rebels.  As Obama spoke eloquently to the American people after the Tuesday airstrikes, he did not mention that besides killing dozens of IS and al-Qaeda extremists, eight civilians, three of them children, also died as collateral damage in the US-led strikes in Syria, according to a Reuters report citing the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Of course, most American taxpayers have no idea that each Tomakawk cruise missile costs about $1.4 million, and 47 of them were launched as part of the 14 overnight strikes against IS in Syria on Tuesday, according to Pentagon.  There is no doubt that IS as an extremist group should be uprooted. But this does not mean that a superpower can ignore the UN Charter and violate the sovereignty of a nation, especially a much smaller one.

"The good, the bad, and the ugly of the US",9/19/2014,"                      United States President Barack Obama, a 2009 Nobel Peace Laureate, has declared two wars in the last two weeks, but they are of totally different kinds.  On Tuesday, he announced a war on the Ebola epidemic by ordering 3,000 US military personnel to the West Africa region and promising additional healthcare workers, medical supplies and field hospitals. It shows the power of example that should be followed by more countries.  Such a laudable act came less than a week after he declared another war to degrade and destroy the Islamic State group through a systematic campaign of airstrikes. On Monday and Tuesday, the Pentagon announced that US fighter jets conducted five airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq, bringing the total airstrikes there to 167.  There is no doubt that IS, as an extremist group, should be stopped and destroyed. But that will not be achieved with just airstrikes, which do not address the root causes.  Obama dramatically escalated drone strikes in recent years, which have not only made him and the US much less popular in the world, but also become a recruitment tool for some terrorist groups. The US has since dialed down the drone strikes.  The prolonged bloodshed, chaos and devastation in Iraq continue to be a daily scene 11 years after the US invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. Many people, both inside and outside Iraq, have asked whether the country is really better off today than under Saddam Hussein.  As if the chaos in Iraq is not enough, the US, again in the name of spreading freedom and democracy, continued its support of regime change in the region to get rid of leaders unfriendly to the US while ignoring or even protecting dictators who are US allies.  In 2011, the US and its NATO allies abused a UN Security Council resolution on a no-fly zone over Libya to topple the government.           "
Snowden nails US lie on its economic spying,9/13/2014,"                        The US government is an expert at taking the moral high ground when it comes to justice. But instead of being apologetic after the devastating revelations made by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in June last year, its top US officials, President Barack Obama included, have been claiming that the NSA has been doing exactly what every other nation does.   That the US surveillance program is the most expansive and intrusive in human history has had no bearing on their thinking. They arrogantly ignore the fact that its targets include not only American citizens, but also people across the world, as well as international organizations and world leaders, some of whom are close US allies.   As if that was not enough, the US has been accusing the Chinese government of sponsoring cyber-based economic espionage in a bid to benefit Chinese companies. Although it failed to provide any concrete evidence in this regard, the US Justice Department took another brazen step in May, charging five People's Liberation Army officers of conducting cyber espionage to steal commercial secrets from US enterprises.   For long, the US had claimed that the NSA didn't engage in economic or industrial espionage. But after Snowden exposed that the American intelligence agency was actually spying on Brazilian oil giant Petrobras, it soon changed its wording, saying it doesn't conduct economic espionage to benefit US businesses. That, the US says, is its major difference from the cyber espionage carried out by countries like China. Such statements have been made by Congressmen, think tank pundits and commentators countless times in the past year while trying to single out China as the villain in the world of economic espionage.   But the new revelations made by Snowden last Friday and carried by The Intercept, a news site created by Glenn Greenwald, who first reported Snowden's case for The Guardian, tell a different story. Secret documents show the US government has devised a secret plan to carry out economic espionage exactly for the benefit of American companies.            "
Leaders should set cooperative tone,9/4/2014,"                      US President Barack Obama is visiting Beijing to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Nov 10 and 11. However, it is his extra day in the Chinese capital on Nov 12 that is likely to attract the most attention, as he is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for face-to-face talks, before they both head to Brisbane, Australia, for the G20 meeting on Nov 15 and 16.  One US official revealed that Obama prefers smaller meetings where real issues can be talked about in a more informal way. There is indeed a long list of issues that the two leaders need to discuss, from the tensions in the East and South China seas and cybersecurity to trade and investment and military-to-military ties, to name just a few.  However, since each of these issues is complex and some are long-standing, it may not be time well spent if they try to delve deep into any of the issues on that precious single day in Beijing. After all, it might take bureaucrats of both governments many meetings over months or years to resolve one single issue.  The two presidents, however, could and should point out the right directions their teams of bureaucrats should go in. For example, regarding the recent encounter between a Chinese People's Liberation Army fighter jet and a US surveillance plane in airspace off China's Hainan Island, both sides could step back a bit. Is the United States willing to gradually reduce its close-in reconnaissance near the Chinese coast? After all, it is offensive if you stand on the sidewalk and stare into someone's window every day and claim that it's legal because you're in a ""public space"".  If the US reduces its close-in reconnaissance, the Chinese are likely to agree to fly fewer jets to monitor or intercept these spy planes, which it does for the sake of national security.           "
Western polluters are free riders in China,8/22/2014,"                      Just two days after US President Barack Obama called China a free rider in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in his Asia policy speech at the East West Center in Hawaii last Wednesday, listed climate change a common cause for the two largest greenhouse gas emitters on the planet.  That is indeed true. Although China's per capita carbon emission last year was less than that in Europe and only about one-third the level of the United States, its environmental challenge as evidenced by the worsening pollution in air, water and soil has become ever more serious.  However, as some Americans tout the fact that the US has pumped less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than years ago, they ignore the fact that a large portion of the greenhouse gases produced in China and other pollutions are a result of China being the manufacturer of the world.  That is to say that much of the pollution and heavy carbon emission industries have been relocated from the US and other developed countries to China in the past decades.  In a study published early this year in the journal of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers, led by Lin Jintai of Peking University in China, found that, in 2006 alone, about one-fifth to one-third of China's air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, were associated with export manufacturing. And about one-fifth of the amounts were directly linked to the production of goods for the US market. As China surpassed the US and Germany to become the top trading nation in the world in the past years, China's exports to the US have also shot up more than 50 percent from 2006 to 2013, meaning that US consumers have left an even deeper carbon footprint in China.  If a free rider is one who enjoys services without paying the cost, such pollution relocation is worse because it causes huge damages to the host nations and their people. For example, the Chinese government has to spend an enormous amount of taxpayers' money, estimated at 5 trillion yuan ($806 billion) in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) according to China's ministry of environmental protection, to tackle the environment challenge, and the 1.4 billion Chinese people are bearing the consequences of living in a deteriorating environment.           "
Nothing could be further from the truth,8/15/2014,"                      I laughed it off when news came last week that US President Barack Obama had made pointed remarks about China's activities in Africa and played up the United States' role on the continent.  Obama said ""we don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources, we recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and their potential"". But he also admitted that the US trade with the continent is only equal to its trade with Brazil and ""we still do the vast majority of our trade with just three countries - South Africa, Nigeria and Angola. It's still heavily weighted towards the energy sector"".  I laughed off Obama's words because as a Washington correspondent, I know just how good US politicians are in distracting attention from the real issues. And if you've traveled in Ethiopia as I did in the past more than a week, China's positive presence in Africa, fueled by China's optimism of the continent's future, is more than obvious.  Walking on the streets in Addis Ababa, people greeted me with ""China"" or ""nihao"", which is hello in Chinese.  At a major traffic intersection near the Africa Hall, a huge Ethiopian Airlines billboard promotes its daily direct flight from Addis Ababa to ""the modern heart of China"" Shanghai.  In bustling Meskel Square, another giant billboard, this time advertizing Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant, states its mission is ""paving the way to the future"" and ""growing together and sharing the future"". Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom company, have been endorsed by the Ethiopian government to build a mobile telecommunications network in the country.  Passing Meskel Square is Ethiopia's first light railway, which is being constructed by a Chinese company. Chinese companies are also building railways from Addis Ababa to a port in the Republic of Djibouti, where 70 percent of the port trade come from landlocked Ethiopia. A lack of such infrastructure has been a major obstacle for Ethiopia to attract foreign direct investment and develop its economy.           "
US must drop bias to help resolve crisis,8/1/2014,"                      The news from Gaza of innocent Palestinian civilians, including many women and children, being killed by Israeli fire is heartbreaking.  The shelling on Wednesday of a United Nations school serving as a shelter caused the deaths of some 20 people and injured more than 100. An initial UN assessment concluded that Israel was responsible for shelling the facility where 3,300 people were seeking refuge. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called the attack ""outrageous and unjustifiable"" and demanded ""accountability and justice"".  The United States has for the first time ""condemned"" the attacks on innocent Palestinian civilians in the neutral UN shelter. But it still did not name Israel. In the past days, top US officials and government spokespersons have expressed ""regret"", and said they are ""concerned"" or ""seriously concerned"" over the deaths of innocent Palestinians.  There have been 1,300 deaths and more than 7,000 injuries on the Palestinian side and close to 60 deaths, mostly soldiers, on the Israeli side. These figures tell who has been using force relentlessly.       Even while expressing their concerns over the deaths of Palestinian civilians, US officials and spokespersons often first emphasize that Israel has the right to self-defense. They seem to suggest that there could be a justification of targeting civilians. But to the rest of the world, targeting and killing innocent civilians should never be justified for whatever reasons.  The bias of US officials and news media in this Israeli-Palestinian conflict is nothing new. To the US, Israel is an ally and an exceptional ally. It raises a serious question of impartiality when the US tries to mediate a cease-fire or peace process.  We all remember the trouble US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ran into last year during his prolonged confirmation hearing when his track record on Israel was called into question. That is probably why when Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said on Wednesday that Hagel called for a cease-fire and expressed concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths as well as the loss of Israeli lives, he also said Hagel reiterated US support for Israel's security and its right to self-defense.  The same is true for US Secretary of State John Kerry. Despite his busy shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, which should be lauded, he has to plead his allegiance to Israel before even voicing his concern over the deaths of Palestinian civilians. ""I spent 29 years in the Senate and have a 100 percent voting record in favor of Israel,"" he said on television on Tuesday.  If so many civilians had been killed by a non-US ally, US officials and news media would have been quick to condemn those responsible. But even as the UN condemned Israel over the Wednesday attack based on an initial assessment, US officials and government spokespersons all said they needed further investigation, in sharp contrast to the times when the US has jumped to conclusions, such as in the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 which crashed on July 17 over Ukraine.  Commentating on the Wednesday morning shelling of the UN shelter, some US officials and TV commentators questioned whether Hamas had stocked missiles and other weapons in the UN shelter, as if the crime of shelling and killing civilians could be pardoned or alleviated if that was indeed true.  As the only superpower in the world, the US could play a major role in mediating an end to the conflict. But that will not be possible until it is willing to adopt an impartial stance. Something that holds true for the US' endeavors in other parts of the world.  The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA. E-mail: chenweihua@chinadailyussa.com         "
US snooping an aggressive intrusion of privacy,7/18/2014,"                      Before the Beijing Olympic Games in August 2008, the local Dongcheng district government issued a public service announcement, telling residents not to ask foreign visitors questions about their age, income, marital status, health, address, religious and political beliefs, profession and personal life.  This was intended to ensure the influx of foreign visitors coming to the sports extravaganza would not be offended.  However, as one elderly person interviewed on China Central Television noted, if people could not ask about these, then there would be little to talk about to make the acquaintance of strangers. After all, these are everyday topics among many Chinese, although increasingly sensitive ones among the younger generation.  Respecting privacy of others is essential. However, that does not seem possible anymore, not because of those inquisitive oldsters sitting in Beijing's hutong (alleyways), parks and teahouses, but because of the massive surveillance programs of the United States National Security Agency.  For example, the NSA has been capturing and storing international calls and e-mails in and outside the United States and in many foreign countries. If they want, they can play back what I talk about with my mom in Shanghai when I phone her from Washington. It's like sending a letter through the post office, and the clerk there secretly opening it and scanning it before delivering it. If found out, the clerk will tell you it was for national security.  This may sound bizarre and scary, yet it's a reality today when the NSA operates the world's largest surveillance infrastructure.  The relative indifference and silence in the US in front of such aggressive intrusion of privacy is astonishing. It raises the question of how much Americans still value privacy, or don't they care if it is said to be for the sake of so-called national security.  It would certainly be a relief to the oldsters in Beijing to know that with their simple questions they are not intruding in the privacy of foreigners at all, and are in fact befriending others.

Development bank will help fight poverty,7/11/2014,"                         The BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, are expected to pursue a development bank during a summit in Brazil next week. This is in addition to the idea of an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that is being mooted by countries in the region.   World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, who visited China this week, welcomed the initiatives for the two new multilateral lending institutions. He said on Tuesday they would not be a threat to his institution but instead help it fight poverty and spur economic growth.   Kim has emphasized repeatedly since taking office two years ago that fighting poverty is a top priority for the World Bank, but additional capacity will make the global cause all the more effective. Emerging countries, such as China, which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the past decades but still faces huge challenge in this area, know just how much remains to be done in this area.   However, US State Department's response seems to be quite ambivalent. Spokeswoman Jen Psaki, while acknowledging the need for additional development to support infrastructure projects, said on Tuesday, the new institution should clearly incorporate high standards of governance, environmental and social safeguards, procurement, and debt sustainability that have been established over decades of experience at multilateral development banks.   Unlike Kim, Psaki, in her pointed words, was clearly viewing the two proposed new institutions as rivals to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, in which the US holds the largest share.   It is true that the proposed BRICS bank could be interpreted to some extent as a reflection of frustration by emerging countries that they are not equally represented in international financial institutions. Throughout the decades, there has been an American at the head of the World Bank and a European at the head of the International Monetary Fund.   In this regard, the new institutions are sending a signal from the rising rest to the United States with its global dominance that things need to change and evolve to adapt to the new reality. But they are also meant to improve the current global system to make it better and fairer, not to overturn it.   Kim should be commended when he refuted the concerns that the proposed new institutions will compete with the existing multilateral lenders by saying that ""our competition is poverty. Our enemy is lack of economic growth. Another enemy is growth that is not inclusive"".            "
Finger pointing not the way forward,7/4/2014,"                      A year ago, Chinese and US government officials worked around the clock to prepare for the fifth China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a meeting that was expected to match the upbeat tone set by Presidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama at their shirt-sleeves summit in Sunnylands, California.   It was a tone for a new type of major country relationship aimed at avoiding conflict and confrontation by expanding cooperation and effectively managing their differences.   The strategic track of last year's S&ED, for example, produced an outcome document that included 91 areas for further cooperation. The two largest economies also pledged to promote a comprehensive economic relationship based on mutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation, with China's commitment to enter substantive talks on a Bilateral Investment Treaty based on a negative list approach the major outcome. A subsequent pledge for further economic reforms made by the Third Plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee has been widely hailed as significant for China, the United States and the world.   But in a developing nation of more than 1.3 billion people, or a fifth of humanity, the complex situation means that many of the reforms will be addressed in a gradual and cautious fashion. However, many Americans don't seem to understand this necessary nuance or the need for patience, despite the fact that many vital reforms in the US, such as on immigration and education, have hit snags.   In China' case, as proved in the past decades, no economic reforms would be possible without macroscopic stability.   In a recent testimony before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former US ambassador to China Stapleton Roy described why patience is needed on progress in areas such as human rights and intellectual property rights protection.   Roy said it took the US centuries to abolish its slavery, a violation of human rights once deeply embedded in the US Constitution. So why should the US expect other countries to change overnight?   I would add to that by saying while there is plenty of room for China to improve in both areas, Chinese politicians are simply not as good at pointing fingers as their US counterparts.            "
PLA participation in RIMPAC a milestone,6/27/2014,"                      The 2014 Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, naval exercises began in and around the Hawaii Islands on Thursday. They are a milestone in US-China relations, especially their military-to-military ties, as it is the first time the Chinese navy was invited to participate in the drills, which involve 22 nations, 47 ships, six submarines, more than 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel.  Four Chinese naval vessels, including the missile destroyer Haikou, the missile frigate Yueyang, the supply ship Qiandaohu, the hospital ship Peace Ark, and a total of 1,100 officers and sailors make the Chinese navy's participation the second-largest after that of the host nation, the United States.  The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy is participating in seven programs, including artillery practice, sea security operations and military medical exchanges between the Peace Ark and US Navy hospital ship Mercy.  The invitation, first extended by former US defense secretary Leon Panetta in September 2012, was significant because China has been excluded from earlier exercises, including the previous one in 2012 when most countries around China participated.  The exclusion of China undoubtedly increased Chinese suspicions that RIMPAC was targeting China, but the inclusion of the PLA Navy this time can help dispel such doubts.  A few weeks ago, many people were holding their breath, as it looked like the PLA Navy might cancel its participation due to the indictment of five PLA officers by the US Justice Department for the alleged cyber theft of US corporate secrets. Because military-to-military exchanges between China and the US have been damaged previously by incidents such as US arms sales to Taiwan, the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and the collision of a US EP-3 spy plane with a Chinese fighter jet in 2001, such worries were justified. However, both sides have learned that they should not let such incidents to spill over and damage their overall relations. This is indeed a sign of maturity in handling their complex and consequential relationship.  Both countries have accused the other of being reluctant to conduct military exchanges, but this just shows that both are eager for more exchanges. And I have heard that Chinese and American sailors have got on well on previous occasions, not only during the drills, but also in the after-drill basketball games or farewell parties, when there is a lot of ganbei-ing.

War money could have been better spent,6/20/2014,"                      The Iraq War, which has come back to haunt Americans, Iraqis and the world these days, cost people in the United States some $2 trillion. It has been the worst reflection of US might. Yet a journalism fellowship that has won enormous hearts and minds for the US has for years been struggling to raise several hundred thousand US dollars a year.   As the World Press Institute marked its 50th anniversary last weekend, it drew journalists from around the world to St Paul, Minnesota. Journalists, many well-established in their country, came all the way from Brazil, Spain, China, India, Japan, Bangladesh, Romania, Britain, Sweden and Australia, demonstrating the power of the program.   Chinese journalist Hu Shuli, now editor-in-chief of Caixin Media and a 1987 fellow, was among them. This inspiring journalist has written in a book about the influence the WPI experience had on her career.   The WPI gathers 10 journalists a year from different countries around the world and immerses them in governance, politics, business, media and culture at every level of US society, with extensive travel.   When I was there in 1998, executive director John Hodowanic, an intelligent and humorous man, stated at the beginning of the program that WPI let the journalists see the good and bad in the US, and ""then you make your own decisions"".   Visits and meetings at some 125 institutions, from AIDS and homeless shelters to a Chicago public school and Capitol Hill, were fascinating and helped me better understand this diverse country.   And there was a hidden gem. Living with host families - whether an African American family in Detroit, farmers in Minneota, Minnesota, or musicians in Ely, Minnesota - remains a memorable experience and one in which I made lifelong friends.   Even among my fellow fellows, the WPI was my first time to get to know and befriend people from Nigeria, Ghana, Argentina, Finland, Pakistan, the former Yugoslavia, and Georgia, as we traveled together for weeks in a big Ford van. As fellows shared their experiences last weekend, I wondered what kind of different power the US would project if that $2 trillion spent in Iraq had been turned into a million programs like the WPI. It could be fellowships not just for journalists, but for people across a wide spectrum, such as students, teachers, government officials, doctors and other professionals and even people in the military.            "
Is a declining US good for China?,6/13/2014,"                      When the Asia Society's ChinaFile online magazine invited me to discuss whether a declining United States is good for China, my feeling was the question was loaded and confusing. Loaded because it seems to assume that Chinese will celebrate a declining US, given the sensational headlines of strategic rivalry between the two nations we see so often in the news media.  Yes. There are Chinese who might jubilate over a declining US, just as there are those in the US who are eager to see China go bust. But that is by no means the majority in both nations.  But first we should clarify whether the question refers to an absolute decline or a relative decline. These are starkly different questions and will get different answers.  An absolute decline of the US, in my view, is not happening because the US economy is still growing and its military is stronger and better equipped than ever. That is also true in many other sectors, such as education and technology.  But a relative decline of the US is already taking place with the rise of countries such as China, India, Brazil and many other developing nations. Such a relative decline will become increasingly prominent in the coming decades as emerging economies continue to expand at a faster pace than the US.  An absolute decline of the US would not serve China's interests, because China has benefited enormously from a strong US in growing its economy, education, technology and various other sectors in the past 30 years of reform and opening-up. The US' relative decline will continue in the coming decade, but an absolute decline would not benefit China much.  Now the question becomes whether the relative decline of the US is good for China and other emerging economies. The answer now is a definite yes.  And the US has also reaped fruits from the rise of China in the last three decades.  The relative decline of the US means that not only has China lifted more people out of poverty, but also there are more middle-class Chinese, who can afford to travel to the US and send their children to American universities. And there is more Chinese investment in the US. That has been happening and has been warmly welcomed by the state and city governments in the US.           "
Sunnylands spirit needed to rekindle relations,6/6/2014,"                      Sunnylands, or the former Annenberg Estate in Rancho Mirage, California, was little known to the world until Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama met there for an informal summit early last June.  The two leaders, one who had just assumed the presidency in China and the other who had just started his second term, agreed to meet because they could not wait for a possible meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Russia in September 2013.  Although they had already met during Xi's trip to the US as China's vice-president in February 2012, it was very encouraging for China watchers to see the two leaders trying to understand each other better in a shirtsleeves summit. The symbolism of this was profound as rather than presenting it as the traditional rivalry between existing and emerging powers, it set the tone for a new type of major-country relationship that aims to expand cooperation and effectively manage differences.  I have heard on numerous occasions from senior government officials of both countries that they are working hard to implement or reflect the Sunnylands spirit.  One of the most tangible signs that progress is being made is the fast growing bilateral military exchanges, which for a long time lagged behind the cooperation in other areas.  China's top military officers, from Defense Minister Chang Wanquan, Chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Fang Fenghui and PLA Navy Commander-in-Chief Wu Shengli, have visited the US and toured military facilities in the past year. US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and several top military leaders from the US Army, Navy and Air Force have also visited China and toured PLA facilities.  The two militaries have conducted joint disaster relief and humanitarian assistance exercises. And China's decision to accept the invitation to participate in the Rim of the Pacific naval exercise for the first time is regarded a major step in building military-to-military trust.  Such progress after Sunnylands has been heartening. Yet what has happened in the last few months has been disheartening and has not reflected the Sunnylands spirit.  There is no doubt that differences, huge differences, exist between China and the US. While the potential for cooperation is limitless, their competition in the economic and security arenas is growing. Especially as the two countries are still suspicious of each other's strategic intentions, whether in terms of the US' rebalancing to Asia strategy or China's growing economic and military might.  The ongoing tension in the South and East China seas which the US is trying to get itself involved in has also complicated the situation, so has the row over cybersecurity, with the two countries trading accusations and adopting a tit-for-tat approach following the US Justice Department's indictment of five PLA officers for cyber theft.  While no one should underestimate the differences between China and the US, what has been lacking is a second and third Sunnylands summit as many suggested a year ago. The most consequential bilateral relationship in the 21st century deserves more attention from the two leaders so they engage in substantive dialogue and more summits like the one at Sunnylands.  The top leaders need to repeat the tone they set at the Sunnylands to reassure everyone that China and the US are heading in the same direction, toward cooperation and not confrontation. This is especially important now that the relationship has hit a snag.  The two top leaders must continue to show their visionary leadership, just as they did at Sunnylands last June.

Futile distraction from the United States of Secrets,5/24/2014,"                           The United States Justice Department's announcement on Monday that it had indicted five officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for cyber theft is a clumsy move.   The indictment came just days after Fang Fenghui, chief of the General Staff of PLA, wrapped up a five-day visit at the invitation of his US counterpart, General Martin Dempsey, to improve bilateral military-to-military relations. It is also just a little more than a month before the PLA Navy will participate for the first time in the Rim of the Pacific naval exercises.   In July, the sixth session of the China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the highest-level annual platform between the two governments, is due to take place in Beijing, and it is expected to cover a wide range of issues from economy to security.   But the US move will have undermined such important talks. It's not a surprise that China responded immediately by canceling the joint cyber security working group meeting since the US shows no sincerity in pursuing a solution through dialogue.   The US knows only too well that its action was bound to provoke a response from China. And such tit-for-tat actions will only escalate. Yet when China announces its own indictment of five people responsible for the reckless global surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency, it will draw applause in countries around the world.   Many Chinese and American journalists attending this week's US State Department briefings could not figure out why the US would make such an unwise decision at a moment when China and the US are cooperating more and when Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting China. The US clearly does not want China and Russia to get too close.   For the Chinese, the timing is embarrassing because President Xi Jinping was hosting the 24-member Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia attended by many heads of state. Should China also pick a special day to announce its indictment?   If the US was trying to irritate China and cause trouble in the bilateral relationship, it has achieved its goal.   In fact, the timing is not good for the US either as it came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the heroic revelations made by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.   On May 13 and May 20, the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, aired a two-part documentary: United States of Secrets. It detailed how the massive and secretive surveillance programs have been introduced by the US government since Sept 11, 2001, and have become part of daily life in a national security state.   Literally Americans and people all over the world have to redefine the word ""privacy"" now given the intrusive NSA activities and capabilities.   The world has also to redefine the word ""national security"" since monitoring everyone's e-mails and phone calls, eavesdropping on world leaders and hacking into companies from China to Germany and Brazil are all included in this category in the US.   I guess many in China might regret that they didn't get to keep Snowden a year ago. But Snowden's revelations, of which only 1 percent has been made public so far by the UK newspaper The Guardian, will continue to prove that the US has completely lost the moral high ground when it tries to accuse others of cyber espionage, whether against foreign governments, individuals or corporations.   The indictment of PLA officers is just a futile distraction from its troves of dirty secrets.

The unsung heroes who built nations,5/22/2014,"                      In the winter of 2004, I took a train ride from Syracuse in upstate New York all the way to San Francisco. The view was breathtaking, to say the least, when the train passed through the snow-covered Rockies in Colorado. While the train was still trundling through the Rockies, the train conductor started explaining how Chinese workers built the railroad through the tough terrain, with many of them losing their lives.  It is hard even to visualize how the railroad was built through the Rockies back then, just like it is hard to imagine how train tracks were laid through the Sierra Nevada, an endless mountain range through Central California, in the 1860s. Most of the tracks were laid by the 12,000 Chinese Americans hired by the Central Pacific Railroad to build the western part of the Transcontinental Railroad. They accounted for 85 percent of the laborers of the Central Pacific, the largest workforce in the United States at the time.  Many of the workers risked their lives and fell victim to the harsh winters and dangerous conditions. They laid tracks on a terrain that rose 7,000 feet over 100 miles (160 kilometers), chipped away at granite and planted the explosives used to blast tunnels through the treacherous Sierra Nevada Mountains.  Many of those Chinese immigrants never became American citizens, because in 1882 the US Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, not long after major railroad projects in the US were completed. The racist act made it impossible for the arrival of new Chinese immigrants, and the Chinese already living in the US were not given citizenship.  May 10 marked the 145th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. Just a day before that, I was in the Department of Labor's Cesar Chavez Memorial Auditorium as US Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez announced the induction of Chinese railroad workers into the Labor Hall of Honor. About a dozen descendants of the Chinese railroad workers present on stage were elated, and some actually cried.  It was a much belated recognition, but several descendants I talked with said it had arrived at the right time.  The Transcontinental Railroad cut short the trip across the US from six months to two weeks. ""But too often lost in discussions of this awe-inspiring achievement is the contribution of the approximately 12,000 Chinese laborers who took on the grueling task of completing the western section of the tracks,"" Perez said.  US President Barack Obama, too, lauded the contribution of the Chinese railroad workers in a proclamation for the Asian American and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month in May. The Chinese railroad workers were also praised for fighting for fairer wages and safer working conditions.  I rarely ask for autographs. But it was a very emotional day, so I asked Secretary Perez to sign a small poster for the induction ceremony. He was probably more emotional, saying it was an honor for him to do so.  For the past week, I have been thinking about China's migrant workers. Over the past three decades, they have built many residential buildings, though most of them continue to live in dilapidated and sometimes unsafe houses. In a large part of our society, they have been treated like second-class citizens. And their children cannot attend schools like the kids of people who have urban household registration (hukou).  Time magazine voted China's migrant workers as Person of the Year in 2009. The owner of Shanghai Tower, a 632-meter-tall skyscraper on the bank of the Huangpu River, has decided to carve the names of the construction workers who helped make it a reality on a wall of the building.  These are all good signs.  But to honor the hundreds of millions of migrant workers who re-built the nation over the past three decades, there should be far greater recognition and more halls of honor.  We should not let them wait for 145 years - not even a year, or a month. Now is the time to honor the greatness of migrant workers!

US president's missing message in Japan,4/25/2014,"                         During his three-day visit to Japan from April 23 to 25, US President Barack Obama seems to be focusing on the US-Japan security alliance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and the trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea. What has been missing is him raising a voice of concern over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's views on World War II history.   Washington expressed its disappointment over Abe's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine on December 26, describing the action as ""exacerbating tensions with Japan's neighbors"". And US media, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times, have also repeatedly blasted Abe's historical views.   The Yasukuni Shrine honors 14 Class-A war criminals from WWII and has long been regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism, which inflicted huge suffering on countries such as China, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Philippines and several other Asian nations.   To many in these countries, Abe's homage to the shrine is like German government leaders visiting a memorial to Adolf Hitler and denying the Holocaust, which, of course, they have never done.   Obama's arrival in Japan came just a day after a Japanese cabinet minister and some 150 lawmakers visited the shrine and two days after Abe made an offering to the shrine.   Whether Obama will publicly voice his concern and objection to such acts during his first trip to Japan as US president, or instead remain silent in order to better advance his other agenda with Japan, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and the US-Japan security alliance, is being closely watched.   Staying silent is something that Obama should not do because it is a matter of right and wrong, justice and injustice.   The US fought alongside the Chinese against Japanese fascists during WWII, so condoning a whitewash of Japan's war atrocities would be a humiliation to those Chinese and Americans who sacrificed their lives.   Obama's failure to raise the issue will also further anger South Korea, which is also at odds with Japan over historical issues. President Park Geun-hye has repeatedly warned Japan to stop denying the past. The huge setback in relations between Japan and South Korea caused by the row over Japan's denial of historical truths has weakened the so-called US-Japan-South Korea trilateral alliance, which some South Korean foreign policy experts now believe is non-existent.

Lobbyists erode politics in the US,4/10/2014,"                      As a Washington D.C.-based journalist, I have been asked by friends from China about how real is the political TV drama series, House of Cards. Drama is drama. Certain plots do exist somewhere at certain times, but it would be wrong to generalize it as daily life on Capitol Hill and in the White House.  However, most Chinese don't get a sense of that unique creature in US politics, especially in Washington D.C., namely the huge army of lobbyists.  In China, these people trying to buy influence would be immediately associated with bribery and corruption, as the Chinese words guanxi (connections) and houmen (back door) suggest. But in Washington, lobbying is a legal profession, consisting mostly of lawyers.  A February story in the weekly magazine The Nation shows that the number of registered lobbyists in the US was 12,281 in 2013. Although it was the lowest number since 2002, the true number is believed to be closer to 100,000.  At the same time, while official figures show that the total spending on lobbying stayed at $3.2 billion in 2013, the real figure is estimated to be closer to $9 billion.  Many retired government officials, Congressmen and Congressional staffers have become extremely active and influential in Washington, except they are now working for consulting firms, public relations agencies, think tanks and interest groups. Each of them makes multi-million dollars a year.  K Street, now synonymous with the lobby industry, is filled with firms headed by former senior officials from US government entities, such as the State Department, Pentagon and Treasury Department.  The transition through the revolving door is often surprisingly smooth and seamless. For example, the official that journalists interviewed just weeks earlier, retires and quickly becomes the head of a consulting firm. And his board members are all former senior government officials.  US President Barack Obama has vented his frustration about lobbyists over the years and tried to ban registered lobbyists serving on government advisory panels. Nevertheless, lobbyists have fought back at Obama by arguing such a ban violates the freedom of speech enshrined in the US Constitution. They have the right to petition the government, they argue.  Data also shows that Obama himself is not immune from the lobbyist influence either. Many visitors to the White House in the past years were lobbyists peddling their influence.  Many lobbyists have tried to wield influence over lawmakers by helping with the fundraising during elections, a phenomenon that is believed to contribute to the dysfunctional politics in Washington. Even Jon Huntsman, former US ambassador to China and now chairman of the think tank Atlantic Council, recently suggested there should be a term limit for lawmakers.  The public resentment of the lobbyists is obvious. Readers of the recent article in The Nation talked about how disgusted they feel about those lobbyists.  ""It's become increasingly clear our government is rotten to its core,"" said one reader. ""Sickening and disheartening,"" said the other, after reading the article, ""Where Have All the Lobbyists Gone?"".  Watching the hearings in Congress from time to time, you can almost feel that some lawmakers are surrounded by the invisible presence of lobbyists.  In the past decades, many US lobbying firms have not only branched out into China, but also flourished by cashing in on the increasing intertwined relationship between the two countries.  So when the Department of Commerce decides to initiate countervailing duties on Chinese products, as it has done many times in the past, it is almost certain that some powerful lobbyists have been working hard.  Or when a senior Pentagon official exaggerates the threat of China, it may well be that certain defense industry firms would benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars of arms contracts in order to counter China's influence.  Some Chinese companies, such as Huawei, have been victims of US lobbyists when labeled as a possible national security threat.  In this sense, House of Cards is a Hollywood representation of Washington's ugly world of guanxi and influence buying.  The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

US spying on Huawei an undeclared invasion,3/28/2014,"                        The world's attention has been so focused elsewhere lately that the United States' latest aggression has gone largely unnoticed by many people.  I am not talking about the huge number of US troops being sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti and Grenada to invade and intervene, but an infiltration, codenamed Shotgiant, conducted by the National Security Agency into the e-mail servers of China's telecom giant Huawei Technologies. Shotgiant is aimed not just at spying on Huawei, but also Chinese leaders, government entities and banks, and potentially a long list of corporations and nations that use Huawei's equipment. So in a sense, it is not just an intrusion into China, but an invasion on a global scale.  The scandal, as exposed last weekend by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden through the New York Times and German weekly Der Spiegel, shows the reckless NSA spying behavior endorsed by the US government.        It would be laughable now for any US government leaders, Congressmen or intelligence chiefs to again talk about cyber security and bluff about such a threat from China or any other country. The US-China cyber security working group set up last year was meant to increase mutual trust and cooperation in the new arena, but the NSA activities have cast serious doubt on the sincerity of the US side.  What is even more shameless is that the US has not admitted any wrongdoing, but instead uses national security as a pretext to justify its actions. It is a pretext that has been overused by the US since Sept 11, 2001, to justify its conduct of invading the privacy of American citizens and the privacy of people around the world.  Huawei has condemned the despicable act. Senior Vice-President in North America William Plummer pointed out the irony that what the NSA is doing to Huawei is exactly what the US has always charged that the Chinese are doing through Huawei. ""If such espionage has been truly conducted, then it is known that the company is independent and has no unusual ties to any government, and that knowledge should be relayed publicly to put an end to an era of mis-and disinformation,"" Plummer said.

Mrs Obama right to focus on education,3/21/2014,"                      US First Lady Michelle Obama is visiting China to promote cultural exchanges and stress the importance of education, but no US news media outlets seem to have got this message.  Instead, the reporting so far has been mostly about why Mrs Obama has not put human rights on her agenda, and why the trip with her two daughters, Malia and Sasha and her mother Marian Robinson, is being paid for by taxpayers, why the White House press corps cannot join the entourage, and why only a few of her events are open to the press.        These may be legitimate questions, but they largely reflect Western news media's obsession with sensational headlines, which cultural exchanges and education clearly aren't.  Yes. Talking with China on human rights is critical. The largest developing nation still has a long way to go to improve in this regard. But that doesn't mean every US leader and spouse visiting China must focus on this one topic, not to mention that the US itself has not put its own house in order given its own problematic record in recent years. Besides, not each and every one of the 1.3 billion Chinese citizens wakes up every morning agonizing over their nation's human rights situation.  On the contrary, education is probably the top priority for every Chinese family. And it is a key concern for ordinary families in the US as well. No one would dispute the influence education has on an individual, a society, a nation and the world. Education has a direct impact on the improvement of human rights in a nation. That is especially true when it comes to the vast underprivileged rural population in China, particularly women.  In this regard, the US First Lady sets a powerful example. Coming from a modest background, her father worked as an employee of a water plant in Chicago and her mother was a homemaker, she graduated with excellence from Princeton University and later Harvard Law School.

Feinstein gives US a wake-up on spying,3/14/2014,"                      Veteran US Senator Dianne Feinstein probably never knew what it was like to be spied on until now.   Since last June's exposure of the National Security Agency's rampant surveillance scandals, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has been a staunch defender of those surveillance programs, despite the fact that these programs have drawn sharp criticism and protests from both US citizens and people in nations around the world.   However, on Tuesday, Feinstein seemed somehow connected with the majority of people in the world, when she lashed out at the Central Intelligence Agency's spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee's staff and computers. She accused the CIA of trying to undermine the committee's work on an investigation report regarding the CIA's illegal torture and rendition programs following the Sept 11 attacks on the US in 2001.   Feinstein said that the CIA spying had broken the law and even violated the separation of power principles embodied in the US Constitution.   The courage demonstrated by Feinstein, a Democrat from California and a supporter of US President Barack Obama, should be applauded, but the 80-year-old may not have changed her mind as much as people think.   Feinstein is deeply concerned about CIA's spying on lawmakers, but she has not said it is wrong for the agency, and the NSA, to spy on ordinary people all over the world.   If US lawmakers' right to privacy is important, what about the privacy of ordinary US citizens and citizens in other nations, especially those which are not allies with the United States?   Sadly, most conversations in the US are about how wrong it is for NSA to spy on US citizens, few seem to care to what extent the NSA is conducting its invasive surveillance outside the US.   About 40 percent of US citizens still approve of the government's collection of telephone and Internet data, which it claims is for anti-terrorism purposes, and only 53 percent disapprove, according to a January survey by the Pew Research Center.   Feinstein revealed she came to the Senate floor on Tuesday reluctantly. She has asked for an apology and recognition that this CIA search on the Senate Intelligence Committee's computers was inappropriate. ""I have received neither,"" she said.            "
The two-faced stance of US on terrorists,3/8/2014,"                         Many Chinese are indignant at the slow and reluctant response from the United States in condemning last Saturday's terrorist attack at the railway station in Kunming in southwest China's Yunnan province.   This despicable attack, carried out by East Turkistan terrorists, killed 29 innocent civilians and injured 143. There can be no doubt that such violent acts targeting innocent people are intended to create fear among the population. But while it has shocked the nation, it has also united it against terrorism.   However, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki lost her usual fluency when she said the US acknowledged that China has characterized the incident as an act of terror. The same confusion was also observed when some media organizations in the United States put quotation marks around the word ""terrorists"" when describing the eight uniformed knife-wielding attackers.   Such wording is perplexing. Does it mean that the US still cannot make a judgment of its own based on the gruesome pictures and widespread reporting, via both official and social media?   The US' reluctance to condemn the terrorists is obvious since neither President Barack Obama nor Secretary of State John Kerry has spoken out and deplored the attack.   The US sought global support immediately following the Sept 11, 2001, attacks and the bombing of the Boston Marathon last year. When former president George W. Bush led the US war of unprecedented scale on terror and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, in every global and bilateral meeting, fighting terrorism became an essential theme, even at International Monetary Fund and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, where the economy is supposed to be top of the agenda.   China has been quick to condemn terrorist attacks, both in the US and elsewhere. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has also provided much-needed anti-terrorism cooperation to the US on the global stage.   But when China needs the same support, the US always looks the other way.   The US government has failed to condemn any violence against innocent civilians conducted by members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and other terrorist or extremist forces.            "
Courage needed for a country fit to live in,2/28/2014,"                      The persistent choking smog that shrouded Beijing and the nearby area for the past week made headlines around the world. The smog, with the PM2.5 reading going above 500, was so bad that it prompted the World Health Organization to declare a health crisis. ""Nuclear winter"", ""uninhabitable"" and ""life expectancy cut by five years"" were just some of the dreadful words filling the media reports.   It should not come as a surprise that the nation's capital suffers such heavy smog, as it is surrounded by some of the country's most polluted cities, mostly in Hebei province. Even in Shanghai, East China, the PM2.5 reading stayed around 170, three times higher than the healthy level recommended by the WHO.   The question people in China are asking is how long they will have to breathe such noxious air.   Scholars declared that China was facing an environmental crisis as early as the late 1980s, but their warnings were clearly not heeded. For example, we have seen officials being removed and arrested for corruption and sex scandals, but none have lost their jobs or been punished for allowing their cities to become some of the most polluted in the world.   So far, which companies had to declare bankruptcy due to the heavy penalties imposed for the serious pollution they caused? How many business owners were put behind bars for the damage they inflicted on the environment?   The laws may have been there for years or decades, yet they are not strictly enforced, or not enforced at all. In fact, such lax enforcement has invited more rampant violations in the past decades.   Yet if smog cuts a person's life span by five years, then the polluting factories have taken the lives of at least thousands of people, a crime punishable by death, given the death penalty still exists in China.   In the United States, there are some who ask if the US Environmental Protection Agency is too powerful. In China, the question might be whether the Ministry of Environmental Protection has any power at all, given that so many factories continue to defy regulations and pollute the air, rivers and soil.

Snowden a hero not a villain to many,2/21/2014,"                         Eight months after the first of Edward Snowden's revelations, it is shocking to hear some people in the United States continuing to lambaste him for going to China and Russia.   They say this is because the two countries have questionable records of human rights and freedom of expression. They probably think that Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, should be stupid enough to go to Britain, where the US authorities could easily extradite him and throw him into prison, just like they did to whistleblower Chelsea Manning, a US soldier who leaked information to WikiLeaks and is now serving 35 years behind bars.   The other example is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Also a whistleblower, Assange has been forced to live in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 2012 because the British authorities want to arrest him on a sexual assault charge at the request of the Swedish authorities.   So a lot of countries simply won't protect Snowden, no matter how much they claim to uphold freedom of speech and how perfect they say their human rights records are.   The truth is that few countries in the world today have the guts to stand up to the pressure and coercion from Washington, except China, Russia, Ecuador and a few others. In this sense, Snowden has chosen to go to the right place.   Not only do such accusations against Snowden not make any sense, their purpose is clearly to divert public attention from the increasingly astonishing revelations by Snowden.   For example, unlike what has been publicly claimed by the US authorities, Snowden told a German TV network three weeks ago that the US National Security Agency is involved in industrial espionage, such as targeting the leading German engineering firm Siemens.   US President Barack Obama said in his Jan 17 speech on NSA reforms that the US intelligence agencies will continue to gather information about the intentions of governments - as opposed to ordinary citizens - around the world in the same way that the intelligence services of other nations do. ""We will not apologize simply because our services may be more effective,"" he stated.            "
US still has a large plank in its eye,2/14/2014,"                      In Debating China, a collection of conversations between Chinese and US scholars on relations between China and the United States, the different views expressed by both sides are often enlightening.  However, the book launch in Washington on Tuesday allowed no debate. It was a solo performance by Evan Medeiros, the White House senior director for Asian affairs. There was not even the usual question and answer session.  Throughout his 40-minute speech, Medeiros failed to mention any of China's great achievements, its contribution to the world, or things that benefit the US or which the US can learn from. Instead, he laid all the blame for the frictions in their relations on China. In everything, from the regional tensions in Asia and human rights to the economy and cyber security, China was at fault.         It is true that China, as a developing nation, can improve in many regards. But it is sad to see only the usual fingerpointing from the US, instead of some self-reflection and self-criticism. For example, Medeiros should acknowledge the human rights abuses at the Guantanamo Bay detention center, the military drones strikes which have killed many civilians and caused terror among the local populations, or its spying on people all over the world, including their leaders.  Just as Medeiros feels uncomfortable that some Chinese see the US as trying to contain China, he should also feel disconcerted that many in the US see every move China makes as a threat.  And Medeiros, a former China specialist at the Rand Corporation, deserves some response after he blamed Chinese news media for promoting a negative image of the United States.  While news media all over the world tend to focus on negative news, reality tells us that the US news media has been engaged in portraying a negative image of China on a much larger scale, given its disproportionate size and global influence, not to mention the China-bashing that was dished up during the US presidential election.  That, to borrow Medeiros' words, has constrained the political space of US leaders to grow cooperation with China.           "
US should face up to reality of China,1/24/2014,"                      The China-US Asia-Pacific Consultations held in Beijing this week was inaugurated in 2011 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to reflect the commitment by the two nations' leaders to build a positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship. The proper phrase for which is building a new type of major country relationship.   However, rhetoric and policies in Washington often do not reflect such a goal.   The words commonly used in Washington regarding China are how to manage China's rise. Such a mindset is based on the premise that China is the villain, the aggressor and the problem, while the United States is the good cop, the defender and savior. The supposition is China needs to be lectured.   The validity of such a proposition is unfounded. It is true that China has been learning a great deal from the rest of the world, including the US, Europe and Japan, over the past 35 years of economic reform and opening-up. But to tell China that it needs to be managed certainly does not give enough respect to China, let alone treat China as an equal.   Despite all the tensions China has with some of its neighbors over maritime territorial and historical issues in recent years, China remains a key trade partner, if not the largest, for most of these countries. Therefore, it has as large a stake as anyone else not to let the situation get out of control.   To assume China's rise is destined to be disruptive to the world is just fiction. Looking back over the last 35 years, China has done nothing anywhere near as damaging to the world as the US has with its meddling in various countries and its invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. The world is still living with the consequences of the US' actions and will continue to do so for years, even decades, to come.   What is known is that China's rise has contributed greatly to the economic prosperity of not just the Chinese people, but people all over the world, including people in the US.            "
Poverty reduction remains a challenge for US,1/21/2014,"                      The United States is known as the richest and most powerful country in the world. It could afford to spend more than a trillion US dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and builds B-2 stealth bombers that cost $2 billion a piece. Yet daily life in its cities often defies such an image.  On my way to and from work via the Washington, D.C. Metro, it's almost always the beggars who greet passengers coming in and out of the stations. They include both men and women, old and young. Some hold signs saying ""hungry"", ""out of work"", ""homeless"" or ""homeless veteran"".        And outside the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library just two blocks from my stop, the Metro Center, there are lines every day of homeless people waiting for free meals distributed by charity organizations or shelter buses coming to pick them up and take them to a place to stay. Although some of the homeless choose to sleep on park benches or some in cardboard boxes in alleyways. On freezing winter days, such as those two weeks ago in Washington and New York, some homeless slept on the sidewalks over the subway grates where the rising heat kept them warm.  Such a picture is true not just in Washington, D.C. and New York, but also for other major US cities, such as San Francisco and Seattle. They are all great cities and my favorite cities in the US, but they would be so much nicer without these scenes, which are surely avoidable in a country as rich as the US.  In his coverage of Camden, New Jersey, last year, NBC anchor Brian Williams described the poorest US city as ""staggering poverty surrounded by staggering wealth"". The run-down houses in Camden contrast sharply with the glitzy skyscrapers of Philadelphia on the other side of the Delaware River.  Statistics show that 15 percent of Americans, or close to 50 million people, were living in poverty in 2012, according to US Censors figures.  They included a disproportionate number of African Americans and Latinos.  A Pew Center report shows that poverty among African-Americans, although it has fallen slightly over the years, is still 27.2 percent. Meanwhile, the share of Hispanics in poverty has risen over the years to 25.6 percent in 2012. Both are more than double the rate for whites, which is 12.7 percent.   There is no doubt that the poverty in the US is quite different from that in the developing world. Many of the poor in the US may have computers, dishwashers and cars. But the existence of such a large underprivileged group is proof that something has gone seriously wrong in this society.  Americans have been debating this issue in the past weeks as they mark the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. Some have applauded the great achievements that have been made since the 1960s, but others have mocked it, quoting former president Ronald Reagan's quip that ""the United States fought a war on poverty and poverty won"".  Both views may be true to some extent, but with the poverty seen on the streets, as well as the poverty that is out of sight, it is no wonder Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, pointed a finger at the US on Wednesday when she warned that in far too many countries, the benefits of growth are being enjoyed by far too few people. She warned the fact that 95 percent of income gains since 2009 went to the top 1 percent in the US was ""not a recipe for stability and sustainability.""  It is clear that poverty reduction is not just an urgent task for developing countries such as China, which has lifted 600 million out of poverty in the past few decades and still faces enormous hard work ahead. It is also a pressing one for the richest superpower.  The author, based in Washington DC, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.   chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         "
US should eschew interventionist policy,1/10/2014,"                      Immediately after the United States-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, we were told that Washington had got a rare opportunity to spread freedom and democracy in the Middle East. The US cited the successful transformation of postwar Germany and Japan to further its argument. For many, the picture painted by the US was indeed rosy.  But what people have seen since former US president George W. Bush ordered the preemptive strikes is an Iraq transformed into a perpetual war zone.  The Iraq Body Count project estimates that 132,929 civilians have been killed since the US-led invasion of Iraq. The total death toll would be 184,000 if combatants were included. On Jan 7 alone, 50 people were killed, including 21 in gunfire, in Baghdad.        Not many people seemed to understand when people such as former Turkish prime minister Abdullah Gul, who is now the president, warned in 2003 that invading Iraq was like opening a Pandora's box, something that later US ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad agreed with.  US President Barack Obama, who opposed the Iraq war as a US senator, has chosen to withdraw American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan after ordering a brief surge in 2010. Former US defense secretary Robert Gates says in his memoir that Obama ""doesn't believe in his own strategy, and doesn't consider the war to be his. For him, it's all about getting out.""  Republicans may think that Obama looks like being on the retreat from the wars, but what he has done in the past five years shows that he still believes in military power and interventionism. In the case of Libya, the US and its NATO allies violated a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone to effect a regime change.  Obama pursued an interventionist policy in Syria, too, although his ambition was cut short because of strong domestic opposition, especially from his own Democrat camp. Nevertheless, the US still supplies arms and other equipment to the Syrian rebel forces, fueling the civil war.           "
Abe's actions an inauspicious start to year,1/3/2014,"                      Japan's attitude toward its heinous World War II history has long caused tension with its two main neighbors, China and the Republic of Korea. And there has been no sign that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe intends to ease the tension in 2014; instead it looks like he intends to inflame it further.   On the first anniversary of his premiership on Dec 26, Abe chose to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, where 14 notorious Class-A WWII war criminals are enshrined. It was the first such visit by a sitting Japanese prime minister in seven years.  Then on the New Year's Day, Japanese Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Yoshitaka Shindo paid, what was probably, his fourth visit to the shrine in the past year.  Abe and Shindo said that their visits were not to hurt the feelings of Chinese and Koreans and should not become a diplomatic issue. They even said the purpose of their visits was peace.  This shows how willing some Japanese political leaders are to run roughshod over the feelings of those who suffered from Japan's brutal militarist past: such as the ""comfort women"" in Korea, China and the Philippines, those abused by the Japanese Imperial Army Unit 731 in its biological experiments in Northeast China and the relatives of the 300,000 killed in the Nanjing Massacre, crimes that Abe and his right-wing cohorts have tried to either deny or whitewash over the years.  German political leaders are a stark contrast when it comes to WWII history. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her predecessors have never done anything to open old wounds. Instead, former German Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt on the wet ground in December 1970 at the monument to the Jewish ghetto victims in Warsaw, Poland.  No wonder Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert on Monday reminded Japan to ""honestly live up"" to its role in the horrible events of the 20th century. He said only on the basis of this honest accounting is it possible to build a future with former foes, a conviction Germany has taken to heart.  This is exactly where Japan's problem is. Some say that Japanese prime ministers have apologized repeatedly for WWII, so the past should no longer be an issue.  If that is true, then the question is why so many Chinese and Koreans still feel strongly that the Japanese apologies have never been sincere or accepted. It's not just because Japanese politicians often use half-hearted words, such as regret, when they should be condemning the atrocities, but also what Japan has done and is doing, such as revising the history of WWII in its textbooks.   The US government has so far said it was ""disappointed"" at Abe's visit. It should use much stronger words in denouncing Abe's acts and urge Japan to face up honestly to its past. After all, Abe's shrine visit came only 19 days after the 72nd anniversary of the attack on the Pearl Harbor, which drew the US into WWII.   Japan may be an ally of the US today, but during WWII, it was China that was the ally, as exemplified by General Claire Chennault's Flying Tigers, a group of American pilots who fought alongside Chinese against Japanese in China during WWII. So the US should not be hijacked in any sense by Abe while anxiously pursuing its rebalancing to Asia-Pacific strategy. This is a matter of principle, justice and conscience.  The year 2014 did not start well for anyone who hopes to see a thaw in relations between Japan and its two neighbors, China and the ROK. It never will if Japanese political leaders are unwilling to honestly and sincerely face up to the country's militarist past and stop humiliating the WWII victims in neighboring countries.

Room in 'elevator' for emerging economies,12/21/2013,"                         I have heard some pundits in the United States, such as Edward Luttwak, a military strategist, describing fast-growing China as a fat man entering an elevator. They say that because the man is so large he should be ultra-polite to people already in the elevator.         This description not only distorts the reality, it sows the seeds for more misunderstanding and distrust.   China is not a fat man, but a healthy, growing adolescent.   With double-digit growth for almost three decades, China has undoubtedly been the most noticeable of the emerging economies. And with 1.3 billion people, about one-fifth of the global population, it would be unfair to try and keep China a skinny boy. That is also true for India, which boasts a population of 1.1 billion, and other major emerging nations such as Indonesia and Brazil.   For a long time, these nations have not had the chance to develop like they have today, so those folks already in the elevator should simply move a bit to allow these adolescents to enter the elevator, instead of standing in front of the doors blocking the way.   Just like the ongoing debate between the developing and the developed nations on climate change, it is unreasonable and unfair to require China, or India, which both have populations several times that of the US, to emit less greenhouse gases than the superpower. In a per capita sense, the US discharges much more carbon dioxide.   On the other hand, it would obviously benefit the world if China and India could manage to control their greenhouse gas emissions amid their rapid economic growth. It would mean that they are following a more sustainable and green path of development than the industrialized world.            "
Year of Snowden and his revelations,12/13/2013,"                      There is no doubt in my mind that former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden should have been Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2013. So I was quite surprised when the editors announced on Wednesday their choice was Pope Francis. Not because I am not Catholic or even religious. But if the Person of the Year is someone who has done the most to influence the world in 2013 for better or worse, then Snowden should have had no competitor this year.   Snowden's revelations since early June awakened the whole world - government, corporations and ordinary people alike.   People have realized that they are under massive surveillance, through various NSA programs, such as PRISM, XKeyscore and Tempora, and the mining of telephone metadata. They have had to redefine the word privacy.   People have been debating how much of their privacy they should relinquish for the sake of national security, a rationale that has been excessively abused by politicians in the United States over the past decade.   Snowden's revelations came as the US was busily attempting to label China a major hacker against the US, and showed that whatever China or any other country is doing in cyberspace simply pales to insignificance compared with the actions of the NSA. The NSA has not only hacked into China's cell phone and telecom companies as well as universities and hospitals, it has also spied on many other countries, including many of its allies, as well as 35 world leaders.   Last week, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom, said that his paper had published only 1 percent of the 58,000 files passed on by Snowden. If 1 percent of Snowden's disclosures are so damning of the US, it's hard to imagine what the impact would be if the remaining 99 percent is also made public.   This explains why the US government went mad after Snowden's disclosure and its failure to press China (more specifically, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) and later Russia, to hand over Snowden. I never understood why the US government would even consider the notion that other governments would hand over someone who had just revealed the extent to which the US is spying on them.   While Snowden is widely seen as a hero and a whistleblower, the US government and many US politicians have tried hard to paint him as a criminal and traitor. The US federal prosecutors have charged Snowden with violating the 1917 Espionage Act.   The NSA surveillance is so rampant that eight major US technology companies, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft, published an open letter in mainstream US newspapers on Monday, calling for an end to the massive snooping by US intelligence agencies.   If not for Snowden, people around the world would be living a lie, blithely believing that the privacy of their e-mails, phone calls and other Internet activities were safeguarded.   I don't know why Time magazine did not select Snowden as the Person of the Year. Hopefully it is not because that the controversial nature of his revelations inside the US. It is certainly not controversial at all in the rest of the world.   Unlike Time magazine, several other publications share the same opinion as me. On Monday, The Guardian declared Snowden its Person of the Year based on a public vote. In total, Snowden garnered 1,445 votes, while Pope Francis received only 153.   If the arrival of Pope Francis has been a breath of fresh air, the revelations by Snowden have been an earthquake whose shockwaves have been felt around the world. Time magazine got it wrong. There was no one more influential this year.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.   chenweihua@chinadailyusa.com         (China Daily 12/13/2013 page8)         "
Careful handling better than knee-jerks,12/6/2013,"                      The debate following China's Nov 23 announcement of its East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone is a solemn reminder that major countries, such as China and the United States, must improve how they handle their differences.         Soon after China's announcement, the US took drastic action by sending two ""unarmed"" B-52 bombers from Guam into China's new ADIZ to show its defiance, although Pentagon officials also stressed that it was a routine flight arranged a long time ago.   Japan and the Republic of Korea also sent flights into the zone without reporting to the Chinese authorities. Such defiance is also meant to provoke and therefore is not conducive to solving problems.   Japan reacted because China's ADIZ overlaps with Japan's ADIZ over the disputed Diaoyu Islands. But such overlapping should not come as a surprise since most countries - including Japan - know that the islands are disputed territories claimed by both countries.   Japan has overreacted by demanding China retract the ADIZ, and led by right-wing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese government forced two Japanese airlines, JAL and ANA, to reverse their original intention to file flight plans with the Chinese authorities, a move that shows it is willing to gamble with the lives of passengers.   China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday, 55 airlines from 19 countries and three regions have reported their flight plans to China. There is no doubt that more airlines will follow suit in order to reduce the risk of any misunderstanding and miscalculation in the airspace. Filing flight plans does no harm; it has only benefits.   After all, the announcement of China's ADIZ is not a declaration of sovereign airspace. So there really should not be so much fuss about it. Japan, the US and many other countries proclaimed theirs decades ago and some have expanded their zones over the years.   The initial response in some countries was so exaggerated you would think China was going to shoot down any plane flying into the ADIZ, something that China has never said it would do, and, of course, has no intention of doing.   It's just like when US President Barack Obama talked about not taking any option off the table in dealing with Iran, Syria and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, no one should see it as US' willingness to use nuclear weapons against these nations. But many people seem to harbor such thinking when explaining China's ADIZ announcement.            "
Changes come with greater understanding,11/29/2013,"                         I was in the Benjamin Franklin State Dining Room in the US Department of State on Nov 21 to observe US Secretary of State John Kerry and Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong renew the Memorandum of Understanding on the Mechanism of China-US High-Level Consultations on People-to-People Exchanges.   A local cameraman, who clearly had no idea of what the event was about, asked what they were signing. He looked puzzled when I said it was about people-to-people exchanges. ""Exchange of prisoners?"" he asked seriously.   ""No,"" I said, somewhat amused. I explained that it's people-to-people exchanges in education, culture, science and technology, sports and women issues.   I don't blame him. As former secretary of state Hillary Clinton pointed out just a day earlier, such people-to-people exchanges do not make headlines, but they are certainly in the ""trendlines"".   The fact that 235,000 Chinese students are studying in US universities and colleges, and about 68,000 US students have gone to study in China in the past more than three years under the 100,000 Strong Initiative proposed by US President Barack Obama in 2009 has not been covered much by the news media.   However, some 10,000 people flying between China and the US on a daily basis are a strong testament to how extensive and deep those exchanges are.   They could be Chinese artists heading toward the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington DC, or American musicians going to China on the State Department's American Music Abroad program. They could be young scientists from the two countries visiting Beijing or Washington for the Young Scientist Forum. They could be Chinese wushu delegations on a tour in US cities or Americans going to Wudang Mountain and Shaolin Temple to learn Chinese martial arts.   They could be students, professors, businesspeople, diplomats and tourists. The number is growing in almost every category. These are the exciting fields, where you see only friendship and cooperation and no conflict and animosity.   But my mood totally changed as I attended a seminar on US foreign policy challenges in Washington this Tuesday. Several pundits were exaggerating the Chinese military threat, as if China were the country that has 11 aircraft carriers and military bases across the globe and spent half of the world's defense budget. Throughout the speech, some apparently saw China as a potential adversary, if not already one.   Various polls also suggest that quite a few people in China and the US still view each other's country as a potential adversary.   Sadly, this is true despite the exploding bilateral trade, the expanding people-to-people exchanges as well as the more high-level dialogues in the past years. Bilateral military exchanges, which have long lagged behind other dimensions such as the economy and trade, have also begun to gather steam lately.   US Vice-President Joe Biden will visit Beijing next week. White House officials expressed that while Biden will seek clarification from the Chinese side on the recently announced East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone, the trip is not for one issue, but a broad agenda of bilateral, regional and global matters. That is a sign of maturity if we recall the bilateral relationship has often been subject to turbulence due to one single dispute.   China and the US are still learning to better manage their differences, but a lot of the differences, including some at military and strategic levels, do seem to arise from a lack of understanding of each other's culture, traditions and history.   That is why so many people are trying to foster people-to-people exchanges to build a solid base for the relationship. As I chatted a week ago with Stephen Schwarzeman and John Thornton, two successful businessmen who now devote much time and money to such exchanges, I have more confidence that the tensions between China and the US can be substantially defused with more people-to-people exchanges.   That of course would also be true for China and Japan, or any two countries.

Rice's finger-pointing should be at the US,11/22/2013,"                         US National Security Advisor Susan Rice talked about the United States' policy in Asia at Georgetown University on Wednesday, clearly in a bid to reassure the region of the US' commitment to its rebalancing strategy. That resolve has been called into question after President Barack Obama canceled his trip to Asia in October due to the partial shutdown of the federal government.   Obama may still not have any appetite for Asia these days as he has been struggling with the aftermath of the mismanaged Obamacare website. That crisis has brought down his approval rating in the US, according to various surveys.   As Rice laid out the US vision for enhancing security, expanding prosperity, fostering democratic values and advancing human dignity in the coming years, she either pointed accusing fingers at China or made pointed remarks.   It's no surprise that the US is assuming the role of the world's policeman or that it is claiming the moral high ground, although no government figures in any other country would make similar statements to those uttered by Rice.   The question now is how effectively can the US still play the role of world policeman given the world is becoming increasingly multi-polar, and how much moral high ground the US still can claim given the many blunders it has committed over the past decade.   Rice was said to be talking about peace and prosperity. Yet just minutes after starting her speech, she had already immersed herself in displaying the US' firepower by reiterating that the US will base 60 percent of its fleet in the Pacific and there will be cutting-edge capabilities for Pacific Command. She urged the US allies - Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia - to take greater responsibility for regional security. But she did not say what such military posturing is aimed at.   It is both shameless and laughable for Rice to describe the Chinese government as sponsoring cyber theft, now that the whole world knows that the US National Security Agency is by far the largest hacker in the world.   Rice also said that while the US diversifies the ways it does business with China, it will continue to champion respect for the rule of law, human rights, religious freedom and democratic principles.   While China has plenty of room to improve in all of these regards, the US is no longer qualified to lecture others.   On Tuesday, Rice denied reports that the US plans to apologize to the Afghan people in a deal that would allow US troops to remain there beyond 2014.   Reuters reported earlier that Obama agreed to apologize in a letter to the Afghan people, admitting mistakes made during the ""war on terror"" and the suffering of the Afghan people, including a shooting rampage in 2012 by a US soldier in southern Afghanistan that killed 16 people, mostly women and children.   At least tens of thousands of innocent Afghan and Iraqi civilians have died since the US-led invasions a decade ago. And Rice felt no remorse for that.   The US is also not a good example of rule of law as demonstrated by the Guantanamo detention center. Obama vowed on his first day in office to close the infamous prison, yet today there are still 164 suspects being kept at the US naval facility in Cuba, without a trial, let alone a fair trial.   Last Friday, I met Medea Benjamin, founder of the peace group Code Pink, in the elevator of the National Press Building. She was busy organizing activities for the massive anti-drone protests set for Washington, D.C. that weekend.   And a group of Yemenis, whose loved ones died during US drone strikes, were in the US capital to pressure the Obama administration to stop the killing and terror caused by the drones.   Rice should acknowledge all these wrongs and reflect on the actions of her own government before pointing her finger at others.

US spying activities are out of control,11/18/2013,"                         When Internet security firm Mandiant issued a report in February accusing a so-called Shanghai-based People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 of hacking into the computers of a wide range of US industries, congressmen, government officials, intelligence officers and a largely unquestioned news media in the United States immediately jumped on the bandwagon railing against China.   No one listened when the Chinese government denied the allegations and claimed that China itself has long been a major victim of cyberattacks, many of which originated from the US.   A story by Adam Taylor of New York-based Business Insider on Feb 19 was largely ignored in the US when the author, through his interviews with many Internet security experts, pointed out the many flaws in the Mandiant report.   Though Mandiant is still trying to recycle its speculative story into a report now being prepared by the US-government-funded US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, no one seems to be paying attention. Some so-called cyber security experts who ran amuck smearing China in the old days have also chosen to keep quiet.   The reason is simple. Whatever China or any other nations have done, it looks insignificant compared to the gigantic spying scheme undertaken by the National Security Agency, as revealed by its former contractor Edward Snowden.   It has also become increasingly clear now why the US government had panicked so much after Snowden's initial exposure in June. Snowden has shown that NSA is spying virtually on everyone from world leaders and international institutions to corporations and ordinary folk.   Reuters reported last week that US President Barack Obama ordered a halt to eavesdropping on the Washington-based headquarters of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He had earlier ordered a stop to spying on the United Nations.   The phone tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and more than 30 world leaders, such as those of Brazil and Mexico, show the recklessness of the NSA's activities. As did the spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, China's telecom giant Huawei, and other companies in Europe and other parts of the world.   The New York Times' report last week that AT&T was giving the bulk of its call records to the CIA and getting paid as much as $10 million a year for it has added more to Snowden's early unveiling of NSA's phone data mining and spying on Internet giants such as Yahoo and Google. Last week Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt blasted the act as ""outrageous"".   The NSA has collected its data in Asian countries by installing equipment inside US embassies and in the diplomatic missions of other ""Five Eye"" nations, such as Australia, Britain and Canada, according to report by the Sydney Morning Herald. The news sparked outrage in the past weeks in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in the region.   With their huge technological edge over other countries, US spy agencies clearly feel they can do anything to break into another's privacy. In a sense, its cyberattacks on China must be vastly underestimated, since a large number of them are probably not detected by China given the technology gap.   Embarrassed by protests from angry allies such as Germany, Obama has asked for a review of the NSA's spying programs, both in and outside the US.   But no one should be optimistic about such a review, although more Snowden revelations are on the way, which should shed more light on the US' murky espionage program.   If Obama truly feels that a lot of what NSA has been doing is wrong and should be stopped, he should thank Snowden for helping to expose these activities. I doubt Mandiant would ever be interested in taking on an ambitious investigation into the omnipresent global hacking activities engaged in by the NSA.

Rebalancing puts brake on better relations,11/8/2013,"                      The US rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific has unsettled relations with China, and distrust between the two countries has deepened since the United States started relocating its massive military assets to the region.   On Tuesday, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III, commander of the US Pacific Command, said that basing a large portion of the US navy in the Pacific should not be viewed as unusual.   Then on the same day, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel vowed that the US will maintain its military supremacy. However, his comment that the Pentagon is not taking the lead in this rebalancing shows that the US has finally realized that its overemphasis on the military component has been unwise.              Pang Li / China Daily      Robert Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College and an associate at the John King Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine that the Barack Obama administration's rebalancing is not contributing to stability in Asia, instead it is making the region more tense and a conflict more likely. Military aircraft and naval ships now crowd the region's skies and water. The US risks getting involved in hostilities over islands that are strategically irrelevant and economically marginal to it.   US arms sales to the region has increased dramatically. The region, as Locklear admitted, has become one of the most militarized regions in the world.           "
A different view outside Washington,10/25/2013,"                      Since moving to Washington in January, I have followed closely what the White House, Congress and the leading think tanks say about China and US-China relations. The comments by senior administration officials about issues such as cyber security and tension on the Korean Peninsula and maritime territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas are frequently red hot.   There is no doubt that the US capital is not just a major source of news and events, it's also where people are extremely good at spinning the news.   So a trip early this week to the Midwestern state of Iowa to cover the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of ties between Iowa and Hebei province was a welcome change and shows how the focus should be on different topics, those at the sub-national or people-to-people level.                Zhou Benshun, Party secretary of Hebei province, shakes hands with Iowa State Governor Terry Brandstad after the signing ceremony for 20 memoranda of understanding between businesses as Hebei and Iowa mark the 30th anniversary of their sister-state relationship. Chen Weihua / China Daily  The enthusiasm for more cooperation exhibited by both Iowans and the some 200 folks from Hebei that attended the occasion was obvious during the visits to schools such as Drake University, and businesses such as Hy-Line International, a genetics company that raises and sells chickens globally, or touring the Kimberley farms, which sell one in every four rows of soybeans to China.   You can tell that everyone feels that by working together the potential for mutual benefits is boundless. This is certainly the message that came from Governor Terry Branstad, Muscatine Mayor DeWayne Hopkins and business leaders.            "
US averts default but not trust deficit,10/19/2013,"                           Shortly after the US Senate voted on Wednesday night to end the 16-day part shutdown of the federal government by raising its debt ceiling, President Barack Obama said there was a lot of work to be done, including the need to earn back the trust of the American people.   That is indeed true. Recent Gallup and Pew Research Center polls show that the American public's confidence in the Obama administration, the Congress and the US economy has nose-dived since the latest political and financial stalemate in Washington began. But Obama failed to even mention that the US should also try to win back the trust of the people around the world, especially if the US still wants to maintain its global leadership.          Senator John McCain (R-AZ) talks to reporters in the US Capitol in Washington October 16, 2013. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell agreed to raise the US debt limit and end the government shutdown. [Photo/Agencies]   At the joint annual meeting in Washington last week, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde both had warned the US of the disastrous consequences of a possible debt default. And in a statement, finance ministers and central bankers representing the world's top 20 economies had urged the US to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties.   In fact, the part shutdown of the US government and the raising of its debt limit had become such a pressing topic at some seminars that serious discussions on the global economic recovery and other matters were put on the backburner. Some moderators even vowed to ensure that their seminars were not hijacked by a debate over the US debt ceiling and government shutdown. But that often proved a difficult task given the clout of world's largest economy.   The political farce staged in Washington has hurt the US' standing in the world, as Obama also admitted in his Thursday speech. Countries such as China and Japan, the two largest holders of US Treasuries, have every reason to complain that Washington has been playing an irresponsible game by putting their assets at risk.            "
Switching to a win-win mindset,10/11/2013,"                      The partial US federal government shutdown, which reached its 10th day on Thursday, has been a mess for tens of thousands of Chinese tourists visiting the US during China's National Day holiday week.   Major attractions, including the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks and the National Mall with its dozen museums, have been closed since Oct 1.     Tourists walk past US Park Service rangers manning a barrier at the World War II Memorial in Washington, as the partial government shutdown entered day six on Sunday. [Photo/Agencies]  A simultaneous fight over raising the US debt ceiling has caused deep concern for China and other major US debt holders.   However, some US pundits believe that the Chinese have reason to celebrate.   At least that was the feeling I got at an Oct 2 function when several pundits at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington talked about how US President Barack Obama's cancelation of trips to the Philippines and Malaysia represented a win for China and a loss for the US. They might have said just two days later that it was huge victory for China when Obama decided to abort the whole East Asia trip.   Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official, shared this view in his article discussing the repercussions resulting from Obama's Asia absence.   It seems that without the benefit of Obama's presence, East Asia will suddenly fall apart or China will take the opportunity to rock the boat.   What we have seen, though, is that President Xi Jinping has not altered his plans in order to take advantage of Obama's absence. What we have also seen is that Chinese leaders laid out their vision for common prosperity, peace and stability in the region. That kind of peace, stability and economic integration has benefited the region, including China. So it would be foolish to suggest that China wants to see conflict in the region.            "
Obama's argument deeply flawed,9/27/2013,"                      The United States is exceptional, President Barack Obama insisted on Tuesday addressing the United Nations General Assembly, clearly in a bid to refute Russian President Vladmir Putin's criticism of American exceptionalism in a recent article published in The New York Times.   In fact, Obama's speech was exceptional as he tried to lecture the leaders and representatives from countries around the world. He said that next year an international coalition will end its mission in Afghanistan, having achieved its task of dismantling the core of al-Qaida that attacked the US on 9/11.    United States President Barack Obama (R) meets with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York Sept 24, 2013. [Photo/Xinhua]  However, Seth Jones, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation and a former special adviser at US Special Operations Command, has long argued that al-Qaida is far from defeated as there has been a net expansion in the number and geographic scope of al-Qaida affiliates and allies over the past decade. It would be surprising if the US president was not aware of this.   Obama also claimed that the US has limited the use of drones so they target only those who pose a continuing imminent threat to the US, where capture is not feasible and there is a near certainty of no civilian casualties.   But was he admitting that he had not exercised enough caution and apologizing because he had dramatically increased drone attacks in the past years?            "
Deal on Syria is good news for Obama,9/17/2013,"                      The agreement reached by Russia and the United States in Geneva on Saturday to bring Syria's chemical weapons under international control was good news not just for the Syrian people but also for US President Barack Obama.   Many US commentators and politicians have argued that the deal was a win for President Vladimir Putin and a loss for Obama. They cannot tolerate the fact that the deal was initiated by Russia instead of the US, which has been dominating global affairs for decades. To them, Obama was beaten by Putin in the fight for prestige.       Russia's President Vladimir Putin makes a statement on issues connected with chemical weapons in Syria at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. [Photo/Agencies]    That is why some became hysterical when The New York Times published a piece on Thursday entitled ""A Plea for Caution from Russia"" written by Putin, in which he called on the US to respect the United Nations system, warned of the possible disastrous consequences of US intervention and challenged American exceptionalism.   However, so far, none of the frenzied words from US Congressional leaders and columnists have made a good counterargument. In a country that touts itself as the champion of freedom of the press and speech, some even questioned how such a ""propaganda"" piece got into The New York Times. Some charged the Times and the public relations firm Ketchum, which facilitated it, of ""abetting and aiding America's enemy"".   All these only prove that Putin's words were indeed powerful and to the point.            "
Obama echoing George W. Bush's stance,9/6/2013,"                      Former US Congressman Allen West has said President Barack Obama's going to Congress for approval for military action in Syria is intended to make the lawmakers a scapegoat if things go wrong.   That is probably true.   Otherwise, it is hard to explain why Obama has suddenly changed course and taken Congress seriously. Throughout his past four years and seven months in office, Congress has repeatedly tried to block his plans with many successes. In return, Obama rails against Capitol Hill, calling it ""increasingly dysfunctional"".   But the heated debate in the British Parliament, which finally rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's call for military action against the Syrian government, must have put enormous pressure on Obama to consult Congress. The debate was broadcast live in the US and widely covered by the US media.   However, Obama has never ruled out taking military action without the authorization of Congress. He may still order missile strikes on Syria even if the House shoots down his resolution and if international law is set aside. And there is no indication that Obama will do exactly what David Cameron has done by admitting the defeat and saying, ""I get that and government will act accordingly.""   Whether he will act without Congress' support, we will only find out when his proposal is rejected by the House.   It is a similar situation with the United Nations.   Obama said in Sweden on Wednesday that he respects the UN process. But if that is the case, why does he insist on bypassing the UN Security Council for a vote that could legitimize military action against Syria under international law?   Even Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, who was standing next to him on Wednesday said he opposes military intervention without UN authorization.   UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also said on Wednesday that under the UN Charter, US-led strikes on Syria would be illegal unless authorized by the Security Council or if made in self-defense.   The reason Obama has not gone through the Security Council is clear. His resolution stands no chance of being passed. This is not only because Russia and China want a diplomatic solution to the crisis, it is also because many countries remember how the US and NATO abused the no-fly-zone resolution on Libya two years ago to pursue regime change and they are not convinced by the US allegation that Syrian government forces used chemical weapons.   There is little confidence in US intelligence after the whole world was duped into believing Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and we are still waiting for the conclusions of the UN investigation into the allegations of chemical weapons use, which could take another two or three weeks.   While the rest of the world looks up to the UN, Obama clearly thinks that the UN Security Council is useful only when it sings the tune the US wants it to.   Obama has also tried to hijack the will of the people by saying: ""My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line"" and ""I didn't set a red line, the world set a deadline."" Obama clearly likes to think that he is the world, or at least the US is the world.   It reminds me of George W. Bush's words that ""either you are with us, or with the terrorists"".

No military resolution to Syrian crisis,8/31/2013,"                      US President Barack Obama spoke passionately at the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr. on Aug 28, 1963. But the two African Americans appear starkly different despite both being Nobel Peace Prize winners.   While King, a civil rights leader, is widely known for his advocacy of non-violence even in the face of violent police action against blacks, Obama feels compelled to use force against Syria. It is another matter that he is on record saying that there is no military resolution to the Syrian crisis.   Obama did not even bother to get the authorization of the United Nations Security Council before considering an attack on Syria for the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Bashar al-Assad government, an accusation that has not convinced the world.   In 2003, the world was angry when former US president George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq. However, the Bush administration at least sent Colin Powell, then secretary of state, to the UN to make a case, albeit with falsified evidence from US intelligence operatives.   Ironically, Obama had opposed the invasion of Iraq while current Secretary of State John Kerry, then a senator, wanted Bush to try all diplomatic means before launching an attack.   While Obama is eager to launch cruise missiles against Syria, Kerry is wasting the joint diplomatic efforts he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made over the past months to hold an international peace conference on Syria by inviting representatives of different rebel groups along with government officials to talks.   Among Americans, the support for military intervention in Syria is only 25 percent that too on condition that Assad has indeed used chemical weapons. Otherwise, the support for an attack is only 9 percent, according to an Ipsos/Reuters survey. And the Arab world, which has been suffering the consequences of Western military interventions over the past decade, has this time declined to back a retaliatory military strike against Syria.   UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, too, is against a US military strike and issued a statement on Wednesday urging UN member countries to explore all diplomatic options to bring all Syrian parties to the negotiating table. Apart from emphasizing that there is no military resolution to the crisis, Ban has strongly opposed the flow of weapons into Syria, saying that ""we must ask (is) what have those arms achieved but more bloodshed"".   The biggest blow to Obama and his British ally, Prime Minister David Cameron, came on Thursday when the UK Parliament rejected military action against Syria. While a similar lively and heated debate in US Congress is lacking, many US lawmakers have warned Obama that he should seek Congress' approval before launching a strike, a suggestion the president does not seem to care much about.   While Obama could go it alone against Syria to ""keep his words"" and not really to protect Syrian civilians there is no doubt that a military strike will result in more chaos and disaster not just in Syria, but also the entire region which is already mired in conflict. We have seen that in the case of Iraq as well as Afghanistan.   You break it, you own it and fix it is a popular saying in the US, and Americans believe in it. But the US did not follow it either in Iraq or in Afghanistan despite wasting trillions of dollars of US taxpayers' money. The situation in Syria will be worse if the US plans a hit-and-run military action against Assad.   Obama should see reason, drop his plan for military action and seek non-violent solutions. By doing so, he may feel a loss of face for not fully honoring his ambiguous promise of taking action against the Syrian government if it crosses the ""red line"", but he could avoid losing face big time by not creating a humanitarian crisis larger in scale than the one in Iraq.

Manning case a dark moment in US history,8/24/2013,"                                 US soldier Bradley Manning, who leaked a trove of US government and military information to WikiLeaks, was sentenced to 35 years in prison on Wednesday.   Without Manning, people around the world would not have known the many secrets of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and the hidden American atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq, including the killing of civilians and journalists. Had it not been for people like Manning, such information would still be lying among the mountains of classified documents, and the US government would still be glorifying the wars.   No wonder, the court decision was immediately condemned by the American Civil Liberties Union. Ben Wizner, director of speech, privacy and technology project of the union, says something is seriously wrong with the justice system when a soldier who shares information with the press and public gets a more severe punishment than those who torture prisoners and kill civilians.   The United States led the invasion of Iraq to ""find"" weapons of mass destruction, which of course the Americans knew were not there. The US and its Western allies turned Iraq into a war zone, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. But still no one has been held responsible, let alone sentenced to 35 years behind bars, for those crimes.   I liked what comedian Steve Colbert said when Manning was acquitted three weeks ago of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy but was found guilty of violating the Espionage Act. Colbert ""discovered"" that Manning was actually spying for the American people against the enemy. And the enemy was clearly the government.   On Wednesday, Manning's defense lawyer David Coombs read an eloquent letter from Manning, seeking pardon from US President Barack Obama. In the letter, Manning explained why he leaked the information. ""It was at this time I realized that (in) our efforts to meet the risk posed to us by the enemy, we have forgotten our humanity. We consciously elected to devalue human life both in Iraq and Afghanistan Whenever we killed innocent civilians, instead of accepting responsibility for our conduct, we elected to hide behind the veil of national security and classified information in order to avoid any public accountability.""   Manning compared the war in Iraq and Afghanistan to the dark moments in US history, including McCarthyism and the Japanese-American internment camps. He believes many of the US actions since Sept 11, 2001, will one day be viewed in a similar light. The 25-year-old quoted late American social activist Howard Zinn as saying that there is not a flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.   Manning challenged Obama by saying: ""If you deny my request for a pardon, I will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society. I will gladly pay that price if it means we could have a country that is truly conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all women and men are created equal.""   I guess a lot of people are eager to know Obama's response to the letter. Will the Nobel Peace Prize winning president pardon Manning and have the courage to acknowledge and apologize for the war crimes in Iraq?   As a young senator from Illinois, Obama bravely opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Although he must have drawn a lot of criticism for his remark and even been labeled unpatriotic, today it is clear that those who opposed the war are the real heroes and real patriots.   That is how Manning should be seen. He is a real patriot who loves his country and humanity. And Obama could prevent this case from becoming a dark moment of his presidency by granting Manning pardon.

US shows no remorse for drone attacks,8/20/2013,"                         On Tuesday, Medea Benjamin led a dozen protesters outside the Walter E. Convention Center in Washington D. C. against the United States' use of drones. Inside, the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, including manufacturers who made the drones, was meeting with participants from all over the world.   The co-founder of Code Pink, a grassroots peace and social justice movement, was protesting at the Obama administration's excessive use of armed drones and the infamous Guantanamo detention center.   It was Medea Benjamin who barracked Barack Obama when the US president made a counterterrorism speech at the National Defense University in Washington in late May.   When I asked the 61-year-old veteran political activist why there seems to be so few Americans rallying behind her, Medea said it is because Americans have been living in fear for the past 10 years, and they have been duped into believing that these drone strikes were very precise.   That is clearly not the case. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks drone attacks, about 411 to 890 civilians, including 168 to 197 children, were among the 2,548 to 3,549 deaths in 370 drone attacks in Pakistan as of July 2013. In addition, 1,177 to 1,480 people were injured.   The Obama administration has authorized 318 drone attacks in Pakistan, 52 were authorized under George W. Bush's 8-year presidency.   ""Drones fly, children die"" was one of the banners I remember seeing on TV amid angry Pakistani protesters against the US drones.   After leading an investigation by a UN team, in March, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, called the drone attacks a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. Earlier he said he would present a report to the UN General Assembly in October after investigating drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories.   The US has not declared war on any of these countries that are targets of its drone strikes.   On Tuesday in Islamabad, Pakistan, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned armed drone attacks. He said the use of armed drones, like any other weapons, should be subject to the long-standing rules of international laws.   The drastic escalation of drone attacks by Obama has also been criticized by some US lawmakers for waging and expanding war without going through the US Congress.   Obama indicated there would be a shift in his administration's drone policy back in May when he was interrupted by Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, but there is nothing to suggest that a shift has happened.   On the contrary, reports show that the US conducted nine drone strikes in the impoverished Arab state of Yemen in the two weeks before last Saturday, which killed a total of 37 suspected militants. Some argued that the so-called militants or combatants actually include all males in a particular area.   Just as there was toward the Iraq War in 2004, there are a higher percentage of people opposing the drone strikes outside the US than inside.   A Pew Center survey released late last month revealed that the vast majority of people outside the US oppose the drone strikes while 61 percent in the US supported.   This is because of huge propaganda efforts of the US government, the military, the CIA, the big corporations that manufactured killer drones and the lobbyists for all of the above. The mainstream US media is not shy about showing gruesome images, except when they are of innocent civilians killed by US drones.   Medea Benjamin certainly has more supporters globally than inside the US. The UN General Assembly can prove that in October in its vote on US drone strikes.

US crusade to hide the truth of spying,8/2/2013,"                        It has become increasingly clear now why the United States government is so anxious to crack down on whistle-blowers, pursuing over 20 charges against Bradley Manning, a US soldier who gave secret government and military documents to WikiLeaks, hunting down former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden who revealed the NSA's vast surveillance programs around the world, and even trying to arrest Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief and founder who published secret files.   On Wednesday, Glenn Greenwald, one of the first journalists to report Snowden's revelations in May in the British newspaper The Guardian, again shocked the world by reporting another US secret surveillance program revealed by Snowden.   The so-called XKeyscore program is touted by NSA in its training materials as its ""widest-reaching"" system for developing intelligence from the Internet. It allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e-mails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals. This new revelation showed how easy it is for the administration to access databases, which US President Barack Obama and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers have blatantly denied.   An analyst just has to fill out a simple on-screen form giving a broad justification for the search. The requests are not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before they are processed.   The new revelation means that if Snowden, reportedly issued Russian entry document on Thursday, is sent back to the US, he will face more charges than Manning, whose sentencing hearing began on Wednesday.   Also on Wednesday, senior US intelligence officials testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the surveillance programs and released classified documents regarding the massive gathering of phone records, as revealed by Snowden.

Racial equality still a dream in the US,7/27/2013,"                        The protests sweeping the United States last weekend over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator who was charged with the second-degree murder and manslaughter of 17-year-old African-American Trayvon Martin, is a bitter reminder that racial tensions are still strong four and half years after the country elected its first African-American president.   In Oakland, California, protesters burned flags, vandalized police cars and smashed shop windows.   ""And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that - that doesn't go away,"" President Barack Obama said, calling for calm.   ""There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. And there are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happened to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often,"" Obama added.   There is no doubt that the 2008 election of Obama as the first African-American president was a milestone toward racial equality.   There are other landmarks, too.   In the US capital, the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial is getting ready for the 50th anniversary of the famous March on Washington on Aug 28.   When I bought commemorative stamps in February that marked the 100th birthday of activist Rosa Parks, it occurred to me that the lives of African Americans are vastly different now.            "
Candid talk is the right way forward,7/19/2013,"                         A positive sign from the June no-necktie summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama in Sunnylands, California, is the tone they set for building a new type of relationship between major powers, one that demands they work together to widen cooperation and narrow differences.   Although that proposal still calls for more content, you could almost hear and feel that message throughout the fifth round of the China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington last week, when senior officials from both sides gathered to discuss a wide range of thorny issues.   It was in sharp contrast to the rhetoric last year when Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a number of ""Day One"" vows about getting tough with China - Obama following suit with some harsh words of his own.   It was also in sharp contrast to the buildup to the Sunnylands summit when the only words about China in the United States were allegations of Chinese cyberattacks.   The National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations changed that: Those noisy folks that accused China of hacking US computers have kept relatively quiet lately. Yet this does not mean that the two sides have become closer on the issue.   The US has tried to play down Snowden's disclosures, arguing that it is what every government does. However, many countries, including its allies, are furious at the excessive US spying. China, which has been a victim of repeated cyberattacks, believes that international norms on cybersecurity should be worked out through the United Nations.   No one knows when the two will reach a consensus on the issue, but the good thing is, both have agreed to discuss the issue through the newly launched working group on cybersecurity.   Another newly established group - the joint working group on climate change - actually achieved concrete results, with the world's two largest economies and two largest greenhouse gas emitters announcing five initiatives to cut emissions and reduce air pollution.   The S&ED last week identified 91 areas for further cooperation in strategic areas and both countries promised more economic, trade and investment cooperation. Both seem excited about the prospect of starting formal talks on a bilateral investment treaty.   However, differences remain, for example over the territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas, the US' restrictive policies on high-tech exports to China and the US rebalancing to Asia strategy.   Given their huge differences in political, cultural, historical and social backgrounds, the two nations will possibly have to live with some of their differences for a long time to come.   Some people have criticized the Sunnylands summit for failing to produce concrete deliverables, except the agreement on phasing out hydrofluorocarbons, potent greenhouse gases.   My feeling is that the most important success at Sunnylands was indeed the tone struck and the consensus that both sides should work together to avoid the catastrophic historical norm of conflict between a rising power and an existing power. It certainly established a clear direction for the two countries to follow.   As the co-chairs of the S&ED for the first time, Vice-Premier Wang Yang, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew got to know each other better, paving the way for a better future working relationship. The same is true for the dozens of cabinet officials and ministers from the two governments, many of whom also met for the first time.   US officials have already praised Wang for his sense of humor. And that was a good beginning.   The four co-chairs often described their talks as a ""candid discussion"", which, compared to the shouting games and lecturing we have seen so often in the past, shows the relationship is maturing.

Obama trying to get foothold in Africa,7/5/2013,"                      In the past 10 days, US President Barack Obama has done two quite extraordinary things. On June 25, he rolled out new measures to fight climate change by using his executive powers; then a day later, he left for Africa for a weeklong three-nation visit. It was his first presidential visit to sub-Saharan Africa, except for a brief stop in Ghana in 2009.   His trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania was focused on trade. The United States is keen to get a foothold in the continent, as emerging economies, such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey, already have a fast-growing footprint in Africa. In 2009, China overtook the US as Africa's largest trade partner and bilateral trade was close to $200 billion in 2012, compared with $10 billion in 2000, and the direct investment in Africa was $2.9 billion in 2012. China has been building roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, and its investment in manufacturing has equaled its investment in mining. In 2011, more than 1 million Chinese visited the continent.   Obama said he does not feel threatened by the growing trade and investment in Africa by emerging economies such as China, but he quickly made a pointed remark: ""If someone says they want to come build something here, are they hiring African workers? If somebody says that they want to help you develop your natural resources, how much of the money is staying in Africa?""           However, Mwangi Kimenyi, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said Obama's visit is just a ""guilt trip"". He said the idea that China is not helping Africans is nonsense. ""China works with Africans, and we have seen major opportunities opening up because of China,"" he said.   It is common for US leaders to point accusing fingers at China when visiting Africa. But the lack of interest in Africa among US citizens is obvious despite the fact that 13 percent of its population is African-American.   While many emerging economies see Africa as a growing force, many in the US are still guided by the outdated view of Africa as a ""hopeless continent looking for handouts"", to use the words of Kimenyi.   The lack of interest is also reflected in the news media. For example, CNN International runs a wonderful program called Inside Africa, but it is simply not available in the US. Meanwhile China's State broadcaster China Central Television devotes more time to African news than any major network in the US.   Obama may not realize that while he was busy meeting officials and announcing a multibillion-dollar electricity initiative, intended to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, which he hopes will be his legacy in Africa, most US broadcasters had zero coverage of his trip or at most 40-second clips.   In sharp contrast, the trial of George Zimmerman, who is accused of second-degree murder in a case that has triggered a heated racial debate in the US, has received unlimited airtime for weeks.   There is no doubt that companies from all countries, including China, must constantly improve their practices in Africa, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. Yet Obama should first get more US citizens, including himself, interested in Africa, instead of throwing a jab at other countries.   That is the best way for the US to play catch-up in Africa.

Dodging key question on Snowden's revelations,6/28/2013,"                        Yahoo News has done an interesting analysis of the 444 briefings through June 18 by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and found 13 distinct ways in which he dodges reporters' questions.   For example, he replied with ""I don't have the answer"" 1,905 times; ""I would refer you to someone else"" 1,383 times; ""You already know the answer"" 1,125 times and ""I am not going to tell you"" 939 times.    Carney, a former Washington bureau chief for Time magazine, may be an expert in evading the media's pursuit of answers. But I assume all government spokespersons do that to a greater or lesser extent. Carney and many US officials have been extremely skillful in dodging questions on the Edward Snowden case and misdirecting public attention.  Instead of addressing the international concern over its global surveillance program conducted by the US National Security Agency, the US has continued to divert attention from its actions by describing the NSA contractor first as a traitor who leaks information that aids terrorists and now as a felon who stole classified government information.  When the Chinese government requested the Obama administration explain the aggressive hacking into Chinese cellphone companies to access the text messages of millions of citizens and the attack on the networks at Tsinghua University and computers at the Hong Kong headquarters of telecom service provider Pacnet, the US again avoided the issue, accusing China of failing to arrest Snowden instead.  US officials, including Carney, have claimed that not detaining Snowden in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will have a negative impact on the bilateral relationship, conveniently masking the fact that it is the US' massive hacking of China that has cast a shadow over relations.  On Wednesday, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also expressed his disappointment at the Chinese government. He too failed to mention how more disappointed China should be at the NSA aggression.           "
US media's disconnect in Snowden case,6/22/2013,"                         Associated Press President and CEO Gary Pruitt, once a First Amendment (of the US constitution) lawyer, has lashed out at US President Barack Obama for his administration's aggressive stance against whistleblowers and journalists.   Addressing the National Press Club in Washington on Wednesday, Pruitt described the government's actions against journalists as unconstitutional and a violation of First Amendment rights. Such actions include seizing AP journalists' phone records by the US Justice Department in the name of national security and naming Fox News reporter James Rosen a co-conspirator in a case involving his source, a State Department contractor now charged with violating the Espionage Act for leaking information to Rosen for his story on the nuclear program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   Pruitt warned that the government's actions would make sources reluctant to talk and thus prevent journalists from fulfilling their job of reaching news to the public, which to a certain extent has become the case since counter-terrorism, and national security became catchwords in the US after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.   Not surprisingly, a member of the audience asked Pruitt why the US mainstream media were sounding increasingly like government spokespersons. Obama's visit to Berlin this week is a case in point, for most of the US mainstream media outlets only reported his call for the reduction of nuclear arsenals and ignored the ""Yes, we scan"" protesters who greeted him upon his arrival in the city.   The anger of many Germans at the National Security Agency's global online and phone surveillance program, which was exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, reflects the feeling of people in many countries.   In the US, however, the discussion in the mainstream media is often limited to whether the surveillance program has violated US citizens' rights. Very few seem to question whether such invasive surveillance programs on governments, institutions and citizens of other countries are legal or, for that matter, ethical.   Ironically, quite a few mainstream US media outlets have given wide coverage to people like former vice-president Dick Cheney, former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden, and National Intelligence director James Clapper, while the surveillance program's critics can be heard only on channels such as Russia Today, Al Jazeera, and Democracy Now.   Given such an environment, even some congressmen and experts, known to have an opinion on everything, felt reluctant to speak their minds on the Snowden case at the recent seminars I attended.   At a recent talk attended by international news organizations in the US, many said they were disappointed with the US mainstream media's failure to present both sides of major stories by giving disproportionate time and space to the people they favored. Some media outlets simply choose to edit out serious news and instead focus on sex and murders. A former US news channel anchor, who works for a media outlet in Washington, said he felt his IQ had increased because he no longer had to repeat celebrities' names every day.   Many mainstream media outlets have spent more time and shown more interest in digging into Snowden's personal life than challenging whether the NSA program is a violation of privacy and civil liberties, which should be the main debate.   That Snowden said he did not believe he would get a fair trial in the US should not come as a surprise. The national security campaign and patriotic brainwashing going on in the US since 2001 mean that he would be sentenced way before a trial began.   Snowden said he landed in Hong Kong not to hide from justice, but to expose a grave crime. He also said that the greatest honor for an American is to be called a ""traitor"" by Dick Cheney. That is the kind of guts the mainstream media need to cover Snowden's case in a national security state.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

World owes Snowden debt of gratitude,6/14/2013,"                      There have been raging debates about whether Edward Snowden is a whistleblower, hero, criminal or traitor after the former CIA employee revealed the US National Security Agency's top-secret surveillance program of people's phone, e-mail and Internet records.  But people both inside and outside the United States owe the 29-year-old a thank you for telling them that they are being closely watched by a government that likes to portray itself as a protector of privacy and civil liberties, and a role model for other countries.  Most people, except those at the NSA and a few lawmakers like Dianne Feinstein, chair of the US National Intelligence Committee, were not aware of the surveillance until Snowden exposed it.  Those who want to cast Snowden as a traitor argue that the information he leaked could aid the US' enemies and poses a national security threat. That has been a familiar excuse used in the US since Sept 11, 2001, to scare people into supporting actions they don't necessarily agree with.  Holding prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention center without trial and drone attacks in other countries are all conducted in the name of keeping the country safe. However, the morality and legality of such actions have been questioned globally.  Now Snowden has bitterly reminded people in the US of the surveillance society they are living in.   There is no doubt that the Obama administration has been hugely embarrassed by the scandal since the Democratic president has long campaigned for transparency and against the government's overreach during the George W. Bush years.  The phone and Internet companies that have aided the NSA in mining people's phone and e-mail data have also come under public scrutiny. Indeed, such companies as Google, Apple, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Verizon and AT&T have betrayed the trust of people worldwide.  The American Civil Liberties Union, a Verizon Communications client, has already filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration in a bid to stop the data gathering and purge any storage of its information.  What is chilling is that the Obama administration has not only denied any wrongdoing, it has vehemently defended the NSA surveillance program as legal and necessary. It is also doing everything it can to hunt down Snowden and charge him with treason.  That is what they have done to Bradley Manning, a 25-year-old soldier who was arrested in Iraq three years ago on suspicion of passing classified information to WikiLeaks.           "
Summit to set sunny tone for times ahead,6/8/2013,"                         As President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama began their two-day summit in Sunnylands, California, on Friday, speculation was rife about its outcome, with some people even trying to hijack the agenda to serve their own interests.   The Chinese and the US governments, however, have said the meeting may not yield specific deliverables, because it focuses on building a personal relationship between Xi and Obama and setting the tone for bilateral ties. The meeting, though, is expected to lay the foundation for future deliverables.   The top leaders of the two countries have been committed to exploring a new type of major power relationship to prevent the ugly conflicts the past has seen between a rising power and an established power.   Most experts in China-US relations have welcomed the idea of holding the summit away from the official glare of Washington and without the rigid formalities and protocols. They say Sunnylands will provide the perfect backdrop for Xi and Obama to better know each other and discuss a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues.   But some people want the two leaders to solve a host of thorny issues during their two-day meeting. Their concern that some of the issues, such as the territorial disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, could push China and the US toward an unwanted conflict is understandable.   That is why it is important for the two leaders to build the kind of trust that could prevent this worst-case scenario from becoming a reality. Nevertheless, maritime territorial disputes, many of which have roots in history, may take years, if not generations, to resolve. The same is true for disputes over trade and investment, and cyber security. They cannot be resolved at just one meeting.   However, if the two countries' top leaders set the right tone, it will be easier for their teams of officials and experts to work on the issues at forums such as the annual Strategic & Economic Dialogue, scheduled for July in Washington.   With cyber security hitting the headlines in the US media over the past few months, some Americans would like to see the Sunnylands meeting as a cyber summit. Such a wish, however, exposes their ignorance about the breadth and complexity of Sino-US ties.   Even US officials acknowledge that China has been a victim of cyber attacks, many of which Beijing says appeared to originate in the US. Washington, on the other hand, alleges some of the attacks on US sites seem to have originated in China.   Perhaps people who want China and the US to focus exclusively on cyber attacks at the Sunnylands summit should be reminded of the many prolonged tussles between the White House and Congress. When the White House and Congress have not been able to resolve their differences over even seemingly minor issues without a fair amount of debate and compromise, how can they expect the Chinese and US governments to resolve their disputes over thorny issues at one meeting?   Obviously, such people are backed or being used by interest groups or lobbyists trying to benefit from the hijacking of the summit's agenda. Some in the mainstream media, which have been increasingly catering to sensationalism, can be seen as one such group.   In his book, Obama and China's Rise, Jeffrey Bader, senior director of Asian Affairs, US National Security Council, from 2009 to 2011, has blasted the media for their coverage of Obama's visit to China in 2009. ""The Western media coverage of the events damaged both the trip and the administration's ability to manage China policy,"" Bader has written.   While the White House regarded Obama's visit to China as a success, the media tried to portray him as being weak in front of Chinese leaders, Bader says. Former US assistant secretary for East Asia Kurt Campbell, too, has said that whenever US leaders visit Asia, the media interpret their visits as one of confrontations with China.   While Obama gave a lot of importance to media coverage during his first term, Bader said on Tuesday that the nice thing about being re-elected US president is that you can have a somewhat thick skin in the second term and ignore domestic pressure on minor issues and concentrate on more important, longer-term issues.   This is exactly what the Sunnylands summit is about: looking at an important and long-term relationship of cooperation as well as competition.

Abe should atone for Japan's war crimes,6/1/2013,"                                 A lot of Westerners are puzzled why so many Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos or people in other Asian nations still cannot get over the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army more than 60 years after the end of World War II.   But the words and antics of right-wing Japanese political leaders in recent months have shown why.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has dismissed the notion that the country's wartime actions amounted to ""aggression"", saying such a definition has yet to be ""firmly determined"" by academics or the international community.   Abe has also defended his ritual offering at the Yasukuni Shrine and the visits to the shrine by 168 lawmakers and several of his cabinet members in April, and said it would be ""quite natural for a Japanese leader to offer prayers for those who sacrificed their lives for their country"", not to mention that the ""lives"" he referred to include 14 class-A convicts condemned by the US-led Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal.   He has also said he regretted that he did not visit the shrine during his first term as prime minister in 2006-07.   Abe also posed for a photo, thumb up, in the cockpit of a military training jet with the number ""731"". As he well knows Unit 731 was a notorious covert biological and chemical weapons research team of Imperial Japanese Army that experimented on Chinese, Korean and Soviet prisoners during World War II in Northeast China.   Abe is not the only right-wing politician in Japan riling its neighbors. Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, a co-leader of Japan's nationalist Restoration Party, angered many in Asia recently by denying that wartime ""comfort women"" were forced into sexual servitude through a system of violence, threats and abduction.   The comfort women, estimated at 20,000 by Japanese scholars and 410,000 by Chinese scholars, were mostly from China, the Philippines and the Korean Peninsula. They included 14-year-old Kim Bok-dong, now 87, who has been traveling in Japan to educate the Japanese public about this infamous part of their history.   The majority of the Japanese public does not endorse Hashimoto's views: the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that 71 percent of respondents to one survey called his comments inappropriate. Still ""inappropriate"" is too light a word.   The US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki has used the words ""outrageous and offensive"" to describe Hashimoto's words.   The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has sent a document to Japan calling on its government to do everything in its power to stop the hate speech and defamation against ""comfort women"".   In editorials, major newspapers in the United States and Britain have condemned both Abe's equivocacy on ""aggression"" and Hashimoto's humiliation of ""comfort women"".   However, top US leaders from US President Barack Obama to Secretary of State John Kerry have yet to publicly condemn the provocative words and deeds of Abe and other Japanese right-wingers.   Some Americans and Europeans have said to me that the Japanese have already apologized for their atrocities during the war - although the apologies by many previous Japanese leaders for their country's horrendous war crimes use half-hearted words such as ""regret"" - and they question why these apologies have not appeased its neighbors.   The answer should be clear now.   People in Asia want to see the Japanese public and more of the country's political leaders coming out and condemning in the strongest terms the revisionism of Abe and Hashimoto.   At Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies in February, Abe delivered his keynote speech ""Japan Is Back"". He said his task is ""to look toward the future"" and make Japan an ""ever more trusted partner for the region and the world"".   However, the only way Abe and his right-wing cohorts can do this is by facing up to the past and sincerely atoning.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Diplomacy and dialogue is the prudent way,5/3/2013,"                           This week's news report that the United States government is again considering arming the Syrian rebels is deeply disturbing, as it signals more bloodshed in that country.   So far, despite some reports suggesting that CIA has been involved in the clandestine supply of weapons to Syrian opposition fighters, the US says it has only provided nonlethal aid.   According to the United Nations, some 70,000 people have died in Syria in the past two years, including civilians, rebels, government soldiers and officials.   Although there have been reports that chemical weapons have been used in the country, US President Barack Obama has remained prudent so far, despite pressure from some Republican congressmen.   ""Without evidence of what happened, how can I make a decision what to do? I have got to make sure I have got the facts,"" Obama told reporters.   ""It is important that we do this in a prudent way,"" he said.   Obama knows the grave consequences of rushing to a snap judgment, as George W. Bush did 10 years ago when he invaded Iraq on the pretext that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction.   While a UN expert panel is still investigating whether chemical weapons were used either by Syrian government soldiers or rebels, the Syrian government has accused insurgents of deploying chemical weapons outside Aleppo on March 19.   Not many in the US, certainly not the news media, seem to care whether chemical weapons were used by the rebels.   The UN has continued to appeal for political dialogue and negotiation to solve the crisis in Syria. However, there seems to be no diplomacy under way and Obama seems to have already made up his mind.            "
US needs to do some soul-searching,4/27/2013,"                         The Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people, including 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a Chinese graduate student at Boston University, and left more than 260 injured, were a senseless attack of terrorism to say the least.   The wounded suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, told interrogators this week that he and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a subsequent police encounter, were motivated by radical Islamic views and anger over the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Though Tsarnaev claimed that he and his brother were self-radicalized and did not belong to any organization, investigations by FBI and the inquisitive media have continued, spreading all the way to Russia's Dagestan, from where the brothers migrated to the US 10 years ago.   While family members and relatives of the victims of the Boston bombings are still grieving and more facts could be uncovered about the suspects, some US news organizations have tried to dig deeper into the truth.   For many, the answer to such questions is simple: Terrorists hate American values and the American way of life. That was reflected in US Vice-President Joe Biden's speech at the memorial service for slain Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier on Wednesday.   Biden said terrorist attacks are carried out to ""instill fear"" and ""jettison what we value most and the world most values about us, our open society, our system of justice that guarantees freedom"". But he did not explain why the suspects were angry at the US for launching the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and causing civilian casualties there.   A report by Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies in 2011 put the total number of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan at 132,000. This does not include indirect deaths or people who lost their limbs or have been suffering emotional trauma.   US troops are responsible for part of the civilian casualties, and public protests against the killings have made constant headlines over the past decade. Even Afghan President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly pleaded with foreign military forces in his country to stop killing civilians during their operations.            "
Enforcement more important than law,4/20/2013,"                        The tough challenge China faces in its endeavor to build a society based on the rule of law can be seen on the ground as well as below it.   An apt example of this challenge is the Shanghai subway system, where passengers entering the platforms are supposed to put their bags and backpacks on conveyor belts for security screening. Each machine is staffed by at least two people, one monitoring the screen and the other reminding passengers to get their bags screened.   But, as I have noticed on my many subway trips over the past few weeks, most of the passengers simply disregard the rule. And yet the people manning the machines do nothing but let them proceed toward the platforms. On several occasions, I was probably the only one to put my backpack on the conveyor belt, and once I saw the man monitoring the screen was dozing and didn't even look at the screen to see what was in my bag.   The security procedure, imposed during the Shanghai 2010 World Expo against a possible terrorist threat, is no longer working. Security today is too lax to prevent people carrying dangerous stuff from entering the stations.   But does Shanghai still need security screening when New York City and Washington DC, always on high alert, don't have them? The point is that since Shanghai still has a security rule, the city authorities should enforce it with a strict hand.   The situation is no different in Wuhan, Hubei province, and Chengdu, Sichuan province, where local police have been cracking down on jaywalkers and moped-riders who ignore traffic lights and rules. Surprisingly still, reports say that many people who were stopped in Wuhan and Chengdu yelled at the police officers, some even using abusive language. In many countries, such people could be arrested for obstruction of justice.   In October 2011, I saw how New York police spent hours cuffing some 700 Occupy Wall Street protesters marching on Brooklyn Bridge. At first I thought the police officers would not make such a big arrest. But the New York Police Department seems to believe that people who break the law by marching on car lanes should be dealt with accordingly. Despite my dislike for the heavy-handed police those days, I respect the fact that laws should be followed by one and all and on all occasions. Or else, cities will have traffic as chaotic as in Shanghai, where vehicles turning left or right often put pedestrians' lives in danger.   Another violation of the law is evident when one enters a place with ""No Smoking"" signs in China only to find many people puffing without a care. The poor enforcement of smoking ban in public places is the main reason why China has failed to honor its commitment to the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.   Why so few people have been punished despite the country's waterways being severely polluted? Why have the people responsible for dumping dead pigs in Huangpu River not been punished for contaminating the source of drinking water for 20 million people in Shanghai?   China has enacted enough laws in the past three decades, including those to deal with the above violations. However, few seem to know who should enforce them and how.   Laws not enforced are worse than not having any at all because it sends the wrong signal that people don't have to take laws seriously. And if people think they can get away with violating laws, the so-called rule of law will remain just a lip service.   What is urgently needed is a mechanism to supervise the law enforcement agencies in order to ensure that they perform their duties of implementing the laws formulated in the past three decades, failing which they should be pulled up for dereliction of duty.

US has not learned lesson from Iraq,3/15/2013,"                         Tuesday will mark the 10th anniversary of the start of the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. A decade ago, along with many other people, I was against this. However, the strong worldwide opposition did not prevent a US-led war being waged in Iraq on the pretext of stopping Saddam Hussein from gaining weapons of mass destruction.   The war in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 was a tragedy, not just for Iraqis but also for Americans; and indeed for the rest of the world as well.   According to figures from the US Department of Defense, by Aug 31, 2010, when the last US combat troops left Iraq, 4,421 US service personnel had been killed, of which 3,492 were killed in action. Almost 32,000 had been wounded in action. Since then, 66 have died, of which 38 were killed in action, and 305 have been wounded in action.   Iraqi civilian casualties have been many times higher. But it has been impossible to put an exact figure on them. Secret US government cables obtained by WikiLeaks in 2010 documented the deaths of 109,000 Iraqis, of which at least 66,081 were Iraqi civilians. Other sources estimate the figure is many times more.   There are also the servicemen and Iraqis who have mental health problems as a result of the war.   Since the occupation ended, the mounting sectarian violence, a devastated society and dysfunctional government have led many to ask whether Iraq today is better than under Saddam Hussein.   On Monday, a suicide attacker drove a car loaded with explosives into a police station in the northern Iraqi town of Dibis, killed five people and wounded dozens, including many students.   The warning 10 years ago that the invasion would open a Pandora's Box of trouble was not heeded. Neither were the words of the now-deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, who warned that the Iraq War would cause horrible global consequences and produce 100 Osama bin Ladens.   While it has finally killed the man who topped its most-wanted list for so many years, the US has slowly started to realize that the Iraq War nurtured radical Islamist groups in many parts of the world.   On the other hand, the US is a war victim, too. It neglected much of its investment in education and infrastructure to pay for the war.   Although the Iraq War was a foreign policy catastrophe for the two countries that committed the most to the invasion, the US and the United Kingdom, neither George W. Bush nor Tony Blair, the two leaders who led their countries to war, has offered any kind of apology, nor have they had to face up to the accusations that they are responsible for war crimes.   It is troubling that only a few news organizations in the US and UK are doing any serious soul-searching about an invasion and occupation that inflicted so much damage on so many ordinary people.   US President Barack Obama, a strong anti-war state senator in Illinois before the Iraqi invasion, also seems unlikely to offer any kind of criticism of his predecessor in the coming days.   In crafting an intervention in Syria to remove President Bashar al-Assad, the US and UK are once again showing their lack of foresight. The rebels that have already received their aid have been accused by international groups of conducting massacres and using children as soldiers and human shields. But the irresponsibility and casual disregard for the consequences displayed by the US and UK are nothing new.   Last Thursday morning at the National Press Club in Washington, Americans from several organizations called on their government to take Cuba off the terrorist list. I asked the panel, which included Congressman James McGovern, who had just returned from Cuba with a bipartisan delegation, why they could not be more ambitious and call for a removal of the embargo. The US has continued its ridiculous and cruel embargo on Cuba despite the disapprobation of the international community.   I always think what the $1 trillion - or more - that the US spent on the Iraq war could have achieved if it had been spent more wisely.   Will the US ever learn anything from the bloody and costly lesson of Iraq?   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Obama stares at dangerous drone legacy,3/9/2013,"                      For most Americans, drones are something that fly in remote foreign skies to kill terrorists who want to harm the United States.   That is probably why their attitude toward drones differs so much with that of the rest of the world. While one Pew Center poll released last month found 56 percent Americans approving drone strikes in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, another Pew study conducted last year showed a majority of people across the world, including in Spain, Germany, Japan, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China and almost all Muslim countries strongly opposing them. In fact, a Pew survey conducted in Pakistan last year showed that 74 percent Pakistanis considered the US an enemy.   Public resentment and protests against drone attacks, including those from many close US allies, have rarely been covered by the US media. Yet public opinion in the US is likely to change when Americans realize that drones could also be used to kill US nationals on foreign as well as US soil, and invade their privacy by using thermal technology to spy into their houses and monitor their daily lives.   On Wednesday, Republican Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky used a filibuster in an attempt to prevent John Brennan, a key figure behind US drone programs, from becoming the CIA director. Paul spent more than a dozen hours accusing the Barack Obama administration of lacking clarity in its drone policy.   In fact, by saying that the US administration has ""no intention"" of using drones to target Americans on US soil, Attorney General Eric Holder did not rule out the possibility altogether.   A day later, on Thursday, Holder wrote a note to Paul before a Senate vote on Brennan saying the US president does not have the authority to use an armed drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on US soil.   Paul's outcry is the latest example of a growing concern among Americans over the drone program, which for long has been kept secret. The American Civil Liberties Union sued several government departments last year over their refusal to disclose information on the killing of American citizens in Yemen, including Anwar Awlaki and his 16-year-old son.            "
US haunted by persistent paranoia,3/1/2013,"                                 The United States boasts the world's strongest military. Its defense spending is more than the next 10 biggest nations combined. The US Navy even has the world's second-most powerful air force - behind the US Air Force.   It's ironic then, that every day you hear US claims that their country is being threatened by others. It's like Mike Tyson worrying about being punched in the face by teenagers on the street.   US President Barack Obama and the congressional Republicans he has been fighting with over budget cuts have both stressed the cuts are a grave threat to the US military, despite the fact that education and medical research will also be affected in a major way.   On Tuesday, Obama chose a shipyard in Virginia, owned by defense and aerospace giant Northrop Grumman, to expound on how scary the budget cuts would be.   ""The threat of these cuts has already forced the Navy to cancel the deployment, or delay the repair of certain aircraft carriers. One that's currently being built might not get finished,"" said Obama.   Such claims suggest the unrivaled military might of the US is fighting a world war or about to enter one, instead of fighting guerilla forces in Afghanistan. They also make people wonder if they should be feeling vulnerable and threatened if the country with such formidable forces is panicking in this way.   Such paranoia is actually nothing new. To those who can recall how Americans felt threatened by a fast-growing Japan in the 1980s and 1990s, it will have come as no surprise that a rapidly rising China, which is expected to supersede the US as the largest economy in the next two decades or even earlier, has caused many Americans to panic.   For US politicians and interest groups, it seems the best way to scare their fellow citizens into following their lead is the manufacture of a China threat. From currency and trade to ideology and military spending, both Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney deployed this tactic during last year's presidential election.   Such paranoia is also reflected in the Rhodium Group report released last weekend, which revealed that the US worries far more about the national security threat from Chinese foreign direct investment than European Union nations, which have attracted twice as much Chinese FDI than the US in the past two years.   The US media's scaremongering that the US has been under cyberattacks from China in the past few weeks is just another example of this tactic. It seems to suggest that the cybertroops in the Pentagon, which has many of the world's top hackers, are less competent than their Chinese counterparts, and that their job at the Pentagon is just playing video games.   It is no secret that the US was behind the cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities. But in the US you rarely hear this, you only hear that countries like China and Russia are the culprits for any cyberattacks, despite the fact that China itself has been a victim of numerous vicious cyberattacks, including many that originated in the US.   Richard Hofstadter, an American historian, wrote in his article The Paranoid Style of American Politics,published in Harper's magazine in 1964, that American politics has often been an arena for angry minds.   He described this as ""an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent"", whether in politicians' suspicions of immigrants or McCarthyist panicking about communist infiltration.   In fact, China is not the only victim of such paranoia. American politicians themselves have also fallen prey to it. Just look at the hats Obama's opponents try to put on his head: Maoist, Socialist and Islamist.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

They've no idea what's going on,2/22/2013,"                         Years ago when I learned that 10 percent of youths in the United States got their news from The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, I immediately laughed it away. However, since then, I have spent countless late evenings watching that talk show and others to relax at the end of a busy day.   The Daily Show on Comedy Central is not just funny, but often witty and can indeed be newsy sometimes. On Valentine's Day, Stewart mocked CNN for its obsession in covering the Carnival cruise ship Triumph, which was stranded in the Gulf of Mexico carrying 4,200 passengers, while ignoring important news like the 12th summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Cairo. Representatives from 56 Islamic countries were meeting there to discuss a host of thorny issues facing the region and the world, from Syria, Mali to Israeli settlements in Palestine.   I am not sure if Comedy Central, in its usual humorous fashion, is the only American television channel that paid any attention to the meeting, despite the huge issues that divide the US and the Muslim world.   The fact that important news is not covered or not covered properly is nothing new. Just hours before US President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Feb 12, major news channels including CNN focused on the hunting down of Christopher Dorner, a US Navy veteran and former Los Angeles Police Department officer who had declared war on the LAPD. Dorner was killed that day during a standoff near Big Bear Mountain outside San Bernadino, California.   Both the saga of the stranded cruise ship and the chase for Dorner are worth covering, but they do not deserve to be covered to the exclusion of everything else.   It is no wonder even Hillary Clinton praised Al Jazeera while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March 2011.   ""Viewership of Al Jazeera is going up in the United States because it's real news. You may not agree with it, but you feel like you're getting real news around the clock instead of a million commercials and, you know, arguments between talking heads and the kind of stuff that we do on our news, which, you know, is not particularly informative to us, let alone foreigners,"" said Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb 1.   Indeed, if you tune in to non-US channels in the US these days, such as the BBC, China Central Television, Russia Today and France 24, you feel far more informed about the rest of the world than you do watching major US cable news networks. News in much of Latin America, Africa and Asia rarely makes it onto these US channels, whose only concern is ratings.   To many Americans who are obsessed with a Hollywood style of news reporting, with several not-so-knowledgeable talking heads spinning the news, the traditional way of straight news reporting found on many foreign TV channels may look outdated. That is a huge challenge for foreign news channels, including Al Jazeera America, which is to make its debut after last month's purchase of Current TV.   Despite the misunderstanding among some Americans that Al Jazeera, with its Arabic name, could be related to Osama bin Laden or terrorism, a bigger challenge is for Al Jazeera and other foreign channels to get people in the world's superpower interested in international news. That apathy to world news is no secret. While Time magazine's Asia and Europe editions carry covers featuring the ""Arab Spring"" to Aung San Suu Kyi, its US edition has covers about marriage or pop psychology.   Polls sponsored by Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs last October showed voters in Ohio and Florida are interested in foreign policy, but many lack knowledge in the area.   One solution is clearly for them to tune in to foreign news channels or even The Daily Show with John Stewart.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily US edition.

US immigration reform a challenge for China,2/8/2013,"                      The proposed immigration reform, which has sparked a heated debate across the United States, has not only raised hopes for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, it has also thrilled Chinese students now studying in American colleges and universities.   According to the proposals put forward by some Democrat and Republican senators as well as President Barack Obama, the US will offer more work visas and green cards to high-level professionals and foreign students with advanced degrees, especially STEM students, that is, those in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.   Washington has been tightening its immigration policy since the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, making it more difficult for foreign professionals and students to find jobs and live in the US. But the policy has been criticized by many and described by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as ""national suicide"".   In his inaugural speech for his second term as US president, Obama said: ""Our journey is not complete ... until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country."" While Republicans and Democrats are still divided on several aspects of immigration reform, it seems that loosening restrictions on professionals and STEM students are among the less controversial. If such restrictions are lifted, it would pose a huge challenge for China, which has been making great efforts to attract and retain talent.   According to the Open Door report of US-based Institute of International Education, 194,029 Chinese students were studying in the US in 2011-12, up 23 percent from the previous academic year and the highest from one country for the third year in a row. Of those, 45.6 percent were graduate students.   According to a Congressional Research Service report issued in November, the 29,490 Chinese students pursuing doctoral degrees in STEM in 2009 represented 35 percent of all foreign students doing PhD in the US. They were followed by students from India (19 percent) and South Korea (9 percent). In fact, Chinese doctoral students accounted for almost half of all foreign nationals in mathematics and physical sciences.   Does that mean an immigration reform in the US, granting more H1B work visas or lawful permanent resident quota, will result in fewer Chinese graduates, especially STEM graduates, returning home? Will that undermine the numerous talent programs started by the central and local governments over the past few years? And will that also undermine the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) blueprint that aims to build China into an innovative society?   Immigration reform in the US may be welcome. But then China has to work even harder to attract and retain talent to staff its universities and research and development centers, and help move the economy up the value chain.   China has to scrutinize whether its wide range of government programs to attract and retain talent has been effective, or some government officials have used the programs as a symbolic gesture to just enhance their profile and achievements on paper.   China also should examine why many local governments fail to provide talents the right environment and fully utilize their skills despite promising an attractive package of high salaries, housing and other benefits. The right environment for such talents includes the rule of law, a free academic atmosphere and probably dual citizenship, which is a hot topic of discussion among many professionals.   The tendency of Chinese officials to seek quick results and immediate returns, too, has deterred many Chinese talents from returning home. Will we tolerate failures like the one in Silicon Valley, where some years ago I listened to entrepreneurs talking about their success stories even after many disasters?   The impending US immigration reform compels China to reflect, and to reflect now, on its talent policy.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Obama should defend pro-choice,2/1/2013,"                         The United States is a jarring contrast between liberals and conservatives.         President Barack Obama talked passionately about gay rights and other liberal ideals in his inauguration speech on Jan 21. But during his speech, a man perched in a tree just behind where I sat and not that far from the Capitol building, kept shouting anti-abortion slogans. He called Obama a ""baby killer"" and held up a sign that read: ""Pray to end abortion.""   Four days later, on Friday morning, when I arrived at Woodley Park subway station, I was shocked to see some 100 teenage students holding anti-abortion slogans and gruesome fetus pictures. They were on their way to the National Mall for the so-called March for Life.   This year marked the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade case in 1973 when the Supreme Court legalized abortions. Opponents have staged an annual march in Washington ever since.   Out of the subway and walking on a downtown street, I saw a group of teenagers, led by two adults, protesting outside a Planned Parenthood center. A woman, clearly angry at the scene, shouted from across the street, accusing the two men of using those children to scare away women who need the services there.   However, the crowd grew bigger as I walked past Pennsylvania Avenue toward the National Mall. With the gray sky and freezing weather that day, it looked like a movie setting for the Dark Ages.   Conservatives such as Rick Santorum, who ran as a Republican presidential candidate, made speeches at a rally in front of the Supreme Court. However, I doubt if the large number of teenagers, many organized by religious groups, had any idea what they were really about.   A Pew Center survey released a week ago shows that 25 percent of Americans see abortion as morally wrong and would like to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling, 18 percent think abortion morally wrong but don't want to completely overturn the decision, and 42 percent don't see abortion as morally wrong.   The Republican Party platform unveiled last year states that an unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life that cannot be infringed.   However, abortion has long been a reality and is accessible to women in most parts of the world. Even in the US, more than 1 million abortions are conducted each year, according to the Center for Disease Control.   Women choose an abortion for a variety of reasons, such as to delay childbearing, because they are unable to afford a baby, not to become a single parent and not to disrupt their education or job, or because they have been raped.   Yet for the protesters last Friday, abortion is a sin, equivalent to murder. Of course, no one, not even Santorum, has talked about punishing the women that do have an abortion. In the name of protecting lives, these protesters try to deny women the right to decide about their own bodies.   I interviewed teenage mothers in the US back in 1998 and still remember the sad stories and hopelessness expressed by the girls, most of whom had a poor family background.   While fewer Americans want to overturn Roe v. Wade these days, the past two years have seen some 135 state-level restrictions on abortions introduced. Meanwhile, the number of abortion clinics in the US has declined. And 87 percent of US counties don't even have a clinic. In North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas and Mississippi, there is only one abortion clinic for the entire state. This has put women's lives in danger.   Obama must fight back by leading a pro-choice march to protect the rights of American women and to enlighten the throng of teenage students in last Friday's march.

Wallowing in misperceptions of China,1/25/2013,"                         The US-China Business Council, a trade association representing 240 companies in the United States, issued a report on Wednesday listing the opportunities and challenges in bilateral trade with China. It targets the new 113th US Congress, which began session on Jan 3.         The report came at the right time, since many members of the Congress, especially the 84 freshman House members and 14 new senators, have little knowledge about China. Yet many of them will sit on various House and Senate committees making decisions that impact on US-China relations.   For years, Congress, whose job approval rating is around 15 percent these days, has been the source of antagonistic noise on China-US trade. The obsession by some members to push for Chinese currency revaluation even after the yuan has appreciated more than 30 percent since 2005 has been a distraction to normal bilateral trade. A report in October by two House Intelligence Committee members on the national security threat posed by two Chinese telecom companies, Huawei and ZTE, only served to deny the mutual benefits to be gained from Chinese foreign direct investment in the US.   On Capitol Hill, where lobbyists abound, everything from China holding $1 trillion US Treasury bills to outfitting US Olympic teams with made-in-China Ralph Lauren uniforms is portrayed as a criminal act.   The lawmakers only need to spend 10 minutes reading the USCBC report and they would make more intelligent decisions regarding China in the coming years.   At the governmental level, both China and the US leaders seem to have realized that their intertwined economies mean that they must not only get along but also make the relationship work so that both can prosper.   Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard University president, once said he could picture a 21st century in which the US and China prosper and he could picture a 21st century in which the US and China do not prosper, but he could not picture a 21st century in which one of them prospered and the other did not.   The outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in November: ""We are trying to write a new answer to the old question of what happens when an established power and a rising power meet.""   ""No one should have any illusions that this will be smooth or easy. But there is reason to hope that over the coming years, we can in fact chart a path that avoids conflict and builds on the areas where our interests align,"" she said.   Obama's inaugural address on Monday also emphasized resolving differences with other nations peacefully.   But when I stepped into the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday afternoon for a talk on China 2013 and beyond, the rhetoric suddenly changed.   When I moved to Washington three weeks ago, I thought I could spend the rest of my life on the Massachusetts Avenue learning from the brilliant minds in the think tanks.   Yet I could not stand the one-sided panel, which contrary to Larry Summers, looked at the US-China relationship as a zero-sum game. Everything about China was either black or white, there was no shade of gray. China is acting badly, China is the source of problems and China is likely to collapse. In one word, China is evil.   I like provocative thinking and enjoy good debate. However, it isn't enlightening if you have all the participants singing the same tune, like the one on Tuesday.   If all you can cite about China are the sensational headlines in the Western news media, then you are ignorant and have nothing worth hearing.   Could it be that those AEI fellows, reputed for their conservative or neoconservative thinking, simply would not or could not say anything rosy about China?   In that sense, these ""highly intelligent"" pundits on Massachusetts Avenue need educating like those freshman Congressmen.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Zero Dark Thirty dims inauguration,1/18/2013,"                           Killing Osama bin Laden has often been touted in the United States as one of the major achievements of US President Barack Obama's first term. But just as he gets ready for a grandiose second-term inauguration on Monday, the Hollywood movie Zero Dark Thirty is set to cast a shadow on this.   The movie, which began playing in cinemas nationwide on Friday, tells of the prolonged manhunt that led to the killing of Bin Laden on May 2 in 2011. It features various torture scenes of terror suspects by CIA operatives, using methods such as waterboarding, humiliation and sleep deprivation.   The 157-minute movie has since drawn fire despite its box office success last weekend, which saw it rake in nearly $25 million. Some senators, such as Democrat Diane Feinstein and Republican John McCain, have called the movie ""grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture resulted in information that led to the location of"" Bin Laden.   The film secured five Oscar nominations last week, but director Kathryn Bigelow was excluded from the Best Director list. Bigelow wrote an article published in The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday responding to the criticism that the movie condones torture. She argues that depiction is not endorsement, otherwise no artist would be able to paint inhuman practices, no author could write about them and no filmmaker could delve into the thorny subjects of our time.   She declares that she supports all protests against the use of torture and inhuman treatment of any kind. She hopes that some of the sentiments alternatively expressed about the film might be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered these US policies, as opposed to a motion picture that brings the story to the screen.   Bigelow believes that torture was used in the early years of the Bin Laden hunt and should not be ignored as part of the story. ""War, obviously, isn't pretty, and we were not interested in portraying this military action as free of moral consequences,"" she wrote.   This is a strong defense from Bigelow, but far from enough. The movie failed to even mention the countless Afghan and Iraqi lives lost during the US' War on Terror, while repeatedly stressing the 3,000 people that died in the terrorist attacks against the United States on Sept 11, 2001.

US defense industry battles cuts,1/11/2013,"                           While there are those who describe the mounting national debt and the dysfunctional politics as the United States' biggest national security threat, what I heard in Washington told a totally different story: That the biggest potential threats are defense cuts and imminent and looming threats from all parts of the world.   That is probably why days before US President Barack Obama announced former Republican senator Chuck Hagel would be his new defense secretary, his opponents had already gone on the offensive vowing to block Hagel's confirmation.   Hagel's ""crimes"" are, according to his critics, his lack of loyalty toward Israel, lack of toughness on Iran, lack of resolve to use force, and an unwillingness to call some Muslim organizations terrorists.   He has voiced misgivings about the pro-Israel influence on foreign policy, which has been seen by some, such as Senator John Cornyn of Texas, as an attack on those ""who view that relationship as a special relationship, one that's important to our national security and stability in the region"".   And when it comes to Iran, Hamas or Hezbollah, US politicians can only become popular by sounding tough and nasty, regardless of how infeasible and ridiculous that might be.   However, I believe that there is a conspiracy behind all these attacks on Hagel. It is a conspiracy plotted by the defense industry, as Hagel's criticism of excessive defense spending would be unfavorable for the industry, despite the record exports that have been boosted by arms sales to Asia.   On Monday, after a talk at the Brookings Institution by Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale, a defense industry representative publicly expressed his sadness over the uncertainty produced by the shrinking defense budget, which is still twice as big as the peak spending during Cold War and equal to the next top 10 spending nations combined.

Break from New York to Washington,1/5/2013,"                         I have been fascinated by New York City, where I stayed and worked for the last three years. But I was equally excited with the opportunity to shift to Washington DC on a new assignment, for I could know more about the ""mystic"" capital of the United States.   I like New York, half of whose inhabitants were born outside the US. It's a colorful city for all the good and bad things. So when one of my colleagues working in DC told me that Washingtonians are friendlier than New Yorkers, I didn't really know what that meant, although my experience during my many previous visits to the US capital had been good.   I agree with Jerry Cohen, a respected legal expert on Chinese law, who told me last week that it was an important time to be in DC. However, the political dramas unfolding in DC during the past weeks and the ones to come in the months and years ahead are totally different from those being staged in the Theater District in the Big Apple every day.   At the New Year's Eve party in our Times Square office on Monday, as friends and colleagues waited and watched the ball drop amid a huge festive crowd downstairs in freezing temperature, several of us had been keeping an eye on TV screens for hours to see how the US House of Representatives would vote on the fiscal cliff bill.   The so-called fiscal cliff, which would have automatically triggered tax increases and spending cuts, has been temporarily avoided. But the watered-down solution does not seem to solve any long-term problem for the US.   For one, the mounting US debt still shows no sign of decline, and US President Barack Obama will have to fight another tough battle in the next two months to get Congress to lift the debt ceiling in order to avoid a government shutdown.   Obama talked tough on the issue before he returned to Hawaii for vacation in a victorious mood after the House passed the fiscal cliff bill. He had had to leave his wife and two daughters there and rush back to the White House last week to make a last-ditch effort to seek a compromise with Republicans.   Such a deal and more spending cuts, as demanded by the Republicans, means that Obama's plan to rebuild the US by, among other things, investing in education and infrastructure may be all talk and no action during his second term in office.   One of my constant puzzles while living in New York was why the world's greatest city had failed to provide cell phone service in its subway. If you think time is money for Wall Street folks, it's quite astonishing that not many of them seem annoyed by this inconvenience. You enter the world of the 1980s once you are underground.   The DC subway system is newer. But when I called a colleague Thursday morning, the cell phone signal quickly faded into oblivion as the train went deep into the tunnel.   The National Press Building in DC, where my new office and many of the news organizations are located, has the same problem. You get uninterrupted cell phone signals only in corners near the window and near the elevators. Does that mean I will miss many calls?   Washington DC is a different place. Washington residents' faces are less expressive than their New York counterparts. And now I am not even sure whether Washingtonians are friendlier.   On Wednesday evening when my friends were helping me move boxes and suitcases into my apartment, two women saw the scene and told me that I should instead go through the back door.   I told them that I have authorization from the building manager. One elder woman, nevertheless, pulled out her cell phone and started taking pictures of us. And she promised to report us to the building's board of directors.   Welcome to Washington DC.   The author, based in Washington, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

No tidings of joy from US politicians,12/28/2012,"                      When US President Barack Obama left Hawaii and landed in Washington on Thursday, much of the east coast of the United States was being battered by thunderstorm, snow and even tornado. More than 1,000 flights were canceled on Wednesday alone.   After spending five days relaxing with his family, such a greeting should have served as a reminder of the harsh reality the nation faces. The golf and relaxation must have seemed surreal once he was back in the White House, especially when looking east toward Capitol Hill, less than two miles away.   In many countries, the public would be outraged if their leaders went on vacation with a ""fiscal cliff"" only days away. But few in the US seem to mind their leaders taking some time off to be with their families at this time of year no matter how bad the situation is.   And the situation in the US is grim: If Obama and the Republicans don't reach an agreement by Dec 31, automatic budget cuts and tax increases, about $600 billion in total, are set to begin in January, which will have a negative impact on US families, businesses and the economy as a whole.   Economists have predicted another recession for the US economy, which has just started to show signs of recovery. They have also forecast that food prices could double.   While most of the US news networks have focused on the impact the budget cuts and tax increases will have on US economy, few have paid much attention to the damage the ""fiscal cliff"" would inflict on other countries.   Vice-Premier Wang Qishan, who visited Washington a week ago, voiced deep concern about the negative impact of the ""fiscal cliff"" on the global economy, so have many others such as Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan.            "
Filling Clinton's shoes is proving difficult,12/7/2012,"                      Speculation is rife as to who will succeed Hillary Clinton as US secretary of state after she steps down in January.   US President Barack Obama's pick for the post, US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, has come under fire from Republicans who claim that Rice and the Obama administration deliberately concealed information about the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, for political gain ahead of the presidential election.   Rice was the public face of the Obama administration when it initially blamed the attack on demonstrations against an Internet video defaming Islam's Prophet Muhammad. The administration later confirmed it was a terrorist attack.   The wrangling over Rice has escalated in the past few days with more Republican senators joining the chorus attacking her. Obama has continued to praise Rice as ""highly qualified"" and said ""I couldn't be prouder of the job that she's done"".   Both sides are clearly back in the campaign mood a month after the election. Obama has not backed down but said on Tuesday that the decision on who will be the next secretary of state has not yet been made.   But it is not that hard a decision.   The strong GOP opposition means that the divisive party politics will only worsen if Obama forces through Rice's nomination and she is confirmed by the Senate. If you recall the nasty presidential campaigns and look at the deadlock over the impending fiscal cliff, a more divisive Washington is the last thing people in the US want to see, and it will certainly make life difficult for Obama during his second term.   As president, Obama should make a compromise and put national interests ahead of party politics. He should act as president of the United States, not the leader of the Democrat party.            "
Remake of Red Dawn breeds hatred,11/30/2012,"                                       If Hollywood action movies are meant to entertain, the remake of the 1984 movie Red Dawn, which hit cinemas across the United States last week, is a huge disappointment in every way.   Compared to many Hollywood blockbusters, Red Dawn, produced with a $65 million budget, looks cheaply made. The mundane plot, poor acting and low technology of the movie simply mean it is a waste of time and money for viewers.   No wonder Rotten Tomatoes, a film review aggregator, gave Red Dawn only 11 percent in approval ratings based on 99 reviews, among the lowest for recently released movies.   But that is not really my point.   The movie is unentertaining because of the premise: troops from the DPRK are invading Spokan in the northwest US state of Washington. After a mysterious power outage strikes the city one night, the locals wake up the next morning to find DPRK paratroopers landing on their streets, tanks rolling. Several local high school graduates lead a resistance movement against the invaders.   As a Chinese viewer, I didn't feel any sense of relief because the invading army was from the DPRK instead of the originally planned Chinese. Distrust and misunderstanding between the US and North Korea are much worse than the mistrust between the US and China.   Such a movie undermines the hard work of so many people trying to build bridges and boost mutual understanding between these nations and peoples. In China's case, it is the Chinese students studying in the US, the US students studying in China, the US government plans to send 100,000 US students to China; the Confucius Institutes that help people in the US learn Mandarin and understand Chinese culture, and non-governmental organizations such as the National Committee on United States-China Relations that has devoted decades of hard work to facilitate understanding between the two peoples.   Such a movie bodes ill for regional and world peace and therefore should not be taken lightly.   I still remember in early 2010, a few months after my arrival in New York, a group of Chinese, known as the Anti-Red Dawn League, protested vehemently against MGM's plan to remake Red Dawn, which would feature a fictional invasion of the US by the People's Liberation Army. The public outcry forced MGM to have second thoughts, for fear of losing the lucrative Chinese market, estimated at $2.1 billion in 2011 and growing fast.   You may claim Chinese people lack a sense of humor. Yet if you study modern Chinese history, it is not hard to figure out why Chinese people are sensitive about foreign invasion, humiliation and demonization.   This is probably why China has not yet made a movie like Independence Day, or Japan Sinks. Hollywood, on the other hand, has produced numerous movies wiping out New York City by tornado, flood, a snow storm or aliens. Would it be less offensive if the invading troops were Canadian, the US' friendly neighbors to the north? The Canadians probably wouldn't be happy either.   What is also troubling is that Red Dawn was clearly remade with the aim of arousing patriotism among Americans. Just listen to the main character: ""For them, this is just some place; for us, this is home. We inherited our freedom, now it's up to all of us to fight for it.""   These are merely Cold War slogans. The original Red Dawn, made in 1984 during the Cold War, told a similar story about a small town in Colorado being invaded by Soviet and Cuban armies.   Movies like Red Dawn, which breed enmity among peoples, should never be made in the first place, let alone remade.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

"Trip should unite, not divide Asia",11/16/2012,"                      US President Barack Obama begins a four-day, three-nation trip - Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia - on Saturday.   During his trip, Obama is expected to refrain from using the nasty campaign rhetoric attacking China that he and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney engaged in during their presidential election campaigns in the United States.   But he should also avoid using the trip as an opportunity to fan the flames of the territorial disputes that have flared up between China and some of its neighbors since the US decided to ""return to Asia"".   Yes, there have been frictions between China and some of its neighbors in their territorial disputes. But it is wrong to suggest that China wants conflicts or even wars with countries in the region. All countries know that a peaceful region will best serve their national interests.   The bigger picture is that East Asia has become the most dynamic region in the world today and trades more with China than with the US. China is now the largest trading partner with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. China has been the major engine driving the region's export and economic boom.   Although Obama and other US officials have repeatedly said the United States does not seek to contain China, the US has used the territorial disputes between China and some of its neighbors - some of which are US allies - as the excuse to step up its military presence in the region.   The disputes may not be settled easily, but the US should not try to take advantage of them in pursuit of its own interests. It is only the US defense industry that benefits from any tensions in the region.   Statistics show that US arms exports hit a record high of $66.3 billion in 2011, triple the previous year. They accounted for 78 percent of the world's total. Much of the weapons were sold to Asia.   And while the US has been beefing up its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region and strengthening its alliances, it has also been promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a core part of its pivot to Asia, in a bid to counter the growing economic interdependency in the region.   The TPP, which aims to include as many Asia-Pacific economies as possible, excluding China, is being sold in the US to a compliant media and unsuspecting public as evidence of the US' leadership on trade. But as Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University and the world's leading free trade advocate, has pointed out, the opposite is true.   Obama enjoyed high global popularity when he took office in 2008, but the Pew Center survey released in June shows that global approval of Obama's international policies had declined significantly since he first took office, while overall confidence in him and attitudes toward the US have slipped modestly as a consequence.   China has not taken advantage of the frictions between the US and other countries and regions in the world. The US should return the favor and not try to wield its influence to divide Asia. It should not force Asian nations to choose between China and the US.   Instead of playing a divisive game, which is common in US politics today, Obama should pursue win-win relations with China.   A lack of strategic trust has been the major obstacle to a strong China-US relationship. Obama's trip should help reduce the distrust, not increase it. That is true smart power.

"Phew, the US election's finally over",11/9/2012,"                      I have been in Chicago this week covering the presidential election in the United States. Chicago is US President Barack Obama's adopted hometown, so it's no surprise that the people I talked to at polling stations all said they voted for him.   However, nationwide it is a mixed map. Obama won the popular vote by less than 2 percent, which means that Americans are more divided than in 2008 when Obama defeated John McCain with a much wider margin.   Everyone should be glad that this election is finally over as the campaigning has only made the divisive party politics that has made Washington so dysfunctional worse.   In his concession speech, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said that ""we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,"" yet that is exactly what he and Obama have been doing during their campaigning.   While third party candidates such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson managed to discuss pressing issues, including climate change, gun control in the US and the legality of drone attacks, in a sensible and intelligent way, Obama and Romney studiously avoided these issues for fear of alienating potential supporters.   Instead they spent a total of $6 billion, the most expensive campaigns ever, attacking each other with unsubstantiated facts and rumors, even though most of the people I met said they were fed up with the negative television and radio campaign advertisements that constantly bombarded them.   Ordinary Americans are fed up with the nation's divisive politics that prevents any real efforts being made to solve the nation's many problems, yet that chronic disease won't be cured any time soon.   And since the Republicans have failed to achieve their goal of making Obama a one-term president, they will continue to use the House of Representatives, which they still control, to obstruct Obama getting anything easily done, as they have over the past four years.   Republican House Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday that they will work together with Obama to address the US' looming fiscal cliff. However, the softening of his party's confrontational tone was merely symbolic and there is little likelihood, if any, that the Republicans will make major concessions to avert an impending fiscal showdown.   So what Obama will actually be able to accomplish over the next four years is open to question.   But it is welcome news for many that the election is finally over, come what may; and not just for Americans.   Chinese people should be glad that the election has finally ended because China was constantly treated like a punching bag during the campaigning. The attacks on China by Obama and Romney were both irresponsible and immoral. I still believe Obama and Romney owe the Chinese people an apology for the kind of hateful words they used against China. Not that any apology is likely to be forthcoming, especially from Romney, whose book was titled No Apology.   The US presidential elections are always disruptive, so it is a relief when they are finally decided.   However, the bitter feuding between the Republicans and the Democrats at present meant this election was so disruptive that Obama continued his campaign rallies after paying only one short visit to New Jersey, which was devastated by Hurricane Sandy.   While Obama celebrated his re-election on Tuesday, many people in New York and New Jersey were still struggling to recover from the havoc Sandy left in its wake.   People in the US need the two parties to stop making empty promises and really work together for the good of the nation.   The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Farewell to outdated infrastructure,11/2/2012,"                         New York, New York, it's a wonderful town. But I never realized how fragile it was until Hurricane Sandy hit the Big Apple.   The images of the carnage caused by Sandy resembled those from a war zone, and more than 30 people in New York are known to have died as a result of the rampaging superstorm.   In the aftermath of the hurricane, tens of thousands of New Yorkers have been living without tap water and electricity and one of the world's oldest and most extensive subway systems, which millions of people depend on every day, was paralyzed due to flooding in some of the tunnels. A fire in Breezy Point, Queens, reduced more than 100 houses to ashes.   Looking across the Hudson River at the Manhattan skyline from my apartment, the normally glitzy skyline is now dark at night. In fact, on Monday night around 9 pm, the Hudson overflowed, turning my apartment building into an island. The flood inundated the ground floor, shutting down the elevator, Internet and cable TV. For a day, we were without access to information and didn't know what was happening beyond our window.   But we are among the lucky ones compared with the millions of people in the states of New York and New Jersey who are suffering from power and water outages that will continue for at least days to come.   As New York started its difficult recovery, some of my colleagues spent three or four hours driving or riding a bus from Queens to Manhattan on Wednesday. The traffic was so bad that my colleague and I spent 50 minutes getting to the entrance of the Lincoln Tunnel only 2 kilometers away.   Many shops and businesses, including some large financial institutions on Wall Street, are still closed, and they will remain so for some time.   The city's infrastructure is old and vulnerable, and the disruption has been so much and so prolonged that many people are questioning whether the city that claims to be the greatest in the world still lives up to that billing.   And we have not really heard the two presidential candidates debating how to improve the United States' outdated infrastructure.   Instead, we have heard Republican candidate Mitt Romney arguing for more defense spending, even though the US defense budget has doubled over the last decade and is more than the rest of the 10 top-spending nations combined.   In fact, many Americans do not know that a B-2 bomber costs $2.2 billion, which would be enough money to reinforce some subway tunnels and upgrade utility systems in New York, and be of great help to disaster relief efforts in the hurricane-hit areas.   Sandy has blown away the bland campaign rhetoric that the news media had been bombarding us with nonstop just days ago.   Romney is still campaigning, but no one, at least not on the East Coast, seems to care what he has to say these days. Instead of labeling Russia the No 1 geopolitical foe, it would have been more sensible for Romney to declare Hurricane Sandy the biggest threat to the US. But it is too late for that now.   Meanwhile, Barack Obama has been widely praised for being a true commander-in-chief by responding rapidly to the crisis and visiting disaster zones in New Jersey and other East Coast cities.   It is time for New York to live up to its claim to be the greatest city in the world, which means Americans need to say farewell to floods and power outages. And this means a farewell to arms.

US must end shameful embargo,10/26/2012,"                                       There have been many talks and articles this week in the United States to mark the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, a Cold War episode that at one point seemed to herald a global nuclear showdown. But missing is attention to the 50-year-old US embargo on the Caribbean island nation.   The longest unilateral economic sanctions in modern history have caused huge suffering for 11 million Cubans, including all women and children. The blockade will go down in history as an immoral and cruel act, just like the treatment of American Indians more than a century ago and the racial segregation in the US before the 1970s.   On Nov 13, the United Nations will again vote on a resolution to denounce the embargo. It will be the 21st consecutive year that the UN has called for an end to the sanctions. In last year's vote, 186 nations, including most of the US' closest allies, supported the resolution. Israel was the only one that sided with Washington.   US leaders like to accuse other nations of being on the wrong side of history. Yet on this issue they have steadfastly chosen to stay on the wrong side.   In fact, US leaders have not only chosen to ignore the rest of the world they have also chosen to ignore the will of their own people. Various surveys have shown that most Americans favor lifting the sanctions and re-establishing formal diplomatic ties with Cuba.   The reason the US persists with this inhumane policy is a shameful one. Cuban-Americans in Florida who are against the Cuban government are important voters and financiers for both Democratic and Republican parties in the critical swing state.   As a senator in 2004, Barack Obama called for an end to the embargo, which he described as a failure. He promised during his 2008 campaign to start negotiations with the Cuban government once elected.   However, except for some easing of travel bans for Cuban-Americans and groups, Obama has done nothing to end the full-blown embargo. Under the embargo, it is illegal for ordinary Americans to visit Cuba and for US companies to do business there.   If Republican candidate Mitt Romney becomes president on Nov 6, the eased travel rights for Cuban-Americans and groups could be taken away. His 10-point Cuba plan includes reinstating travel and remittance restrictions.   When I described to some Americans the fascinating culture, beaches and people I discovered during my two trips to Cuba last year, I could see the envy in their eyes.   It is interesting that when late president John F. Kennedy announced the embargo on Feb 3, 1962, he cited ""the subversive offensive of Sino-Soviet Communism with which the government of Cuba is publicly aligned"". The Cold War has long been over, there is no Soviet Union and China is a major trading partner of the US. Yet many US politicians still cling to a Cold War mentality.   The embargo on Cuba continues despite the fact that Cuba, under Raul Castro, has embarked on political and economic reforms in the last two years. Just a week ago, the official newspaper Granma reported the government will ease travel restrictions for its citizens.   Economic sanctions hurt ordinary people more than government leaders. Even Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi did not like the idea of sanctions. Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Sept 18, she said: ""I don't think we need to cling on to sanctions unnecessarily.""   In 1962, the US embargo on Cuba was imposed to isolate Cuba. But now the US itself has become totally isolated on this issue. And the UN vote on Nov 13 will be a fresh reminder.

China bashing should soon subside,10/24/2012,"                                       In their second televised debate last week, US President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney spared no effort in their attempts to blame China for all the United States' troubles. So their performance during the third debate at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday evening came as something of a surprise.   Romney once again made his ""Day One"" oath to label China a currency manipulator and Obama touted his success in bringing World Trade Organization cases against the Chinese mainland. But, for the first time in the three debates, both Obama and Romney mentioned that the US and China can be partners.   Both candidates, who have made it a habit to talk tough on dealing with China, have denied this in the two previous debates, as well as in their numerous campaign speeches and advertisements.   However, while those who have felt disgusted by the candidates' unseemly China-bashing rhetoric during the campaign will have breathed a sigh of relief after Monday's debate, it is a pity that the two candidates did not elaborate their China policies.   To many analysts from China and the US, the complex relationship between the world's two largest economies is the single most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century and deserved far more serious attention during the three debates.   I watched the debate on Monday evening in the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where Foreign Affairs magazine hosted a talk before the debate.   The two panelists, Daniel Drezner, a professor of international studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, and Rachel Kleinfeld, founding president and CEO of Truman National Security Project, pointed out the many absurdities the two candidates had uttered on China and on many other global issues during their campaigning.   While Kleinfeld criticized the candidates' isolationist comments and China bashing, Drezner lamented that the candidates had made such foolish foreign-policy comments when foreign policy really counts for very little in US elections.   During Monday night's debate, Obama again said his punitive tariffs on Chinese tires two years ago had saved US jobs. But as Drezner pointed out before the debate that action of Obama cost $1 million per job saved in the US, according to a study by the Peterson Institute.   Drezner pointed out that although the two candidates believe that talking tough on China economically may resonate with some voters, many voters are becoming increasing cynical about their China rhetoric.   Even Marco Rubio, the promising young Republican senator from Florida who introduced Romney at the Republican National Convention about two months ago, has tried to distance himself from Romney these days on the issue of labeling China a currency manipulator, fearing it will trigger a trade war.   More Republicans have voiced similar concerns, not to mention the strong opposition against labeling China a currency manipulator from the business community in the US.   Perhaps this is why the two candidates have finally toned down their China bashing a bit and started to mention working and collaborating with China.   Obama has talked a lot about working together with China during the past three years. But such words disappeared after he started his re-election campaign, as he tried to show that he was just as tough as Romney on China.   Former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both talked extremely tough on China during their presidential campaigns. But once elected, they abandoned their campaign rhetoric.   Thankfully, that will probably be the case after the election on Nov 6.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Honesty should be ticket to White House,10/19/2012,"                                 Fact-checkers in the United States have been busy after the second presidential debate on Tuesday evening at Hofstra University. They want to find out whether President Barack Obama will hike the tax on the middle class by $4,000 a year or whether Republican challenger Mitt Romney is capable of creating 12 million jobs in four years with his tax plan.   But as Romney pollster Neil Newhouse suggested months ago fact-checkers are biased. Otherwise why are no fact-checkers bothering to dig into Obama and Romney's rants about China on Tuesday night?   Romney repeatedly shouted that he will label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. But even researchers at the Peterson Institute in Washington now say the Chinese currency is only undervalued by about 7 percent against the US dollar.   The yuan has appreciated more than 30 percent since 2005 and China's current account surplus narrowed to only 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product in the first half of this year. So most experts believe that there is not a case to be made for yuan appreciation.   Is Romney just ignorant of this or is his mind simply frozen in the past?   Obama could challenge Romney on this currency lie, but that might prove costly since it seems it is suicidal to appear soft on and close to China during this US presidential race.   Amid the US' economic woes, many Americans want to see the president taking on China, which they view as a threat to their economic supremacy, just as their country took on Japan in the 1980s and the former Soviet Union in the Cold War era.   So Obama has competed with Romney to show who will be toughest on China, holding up his decision to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese tires that he claims saved American jobs as proof of his intentions. However, the Washington-based US-China Business Council said while the tariffs reduced tire imports from China, the vacuum was not filled by US producers, but by cheap imports from places such as Indonesia and Mexico.   A Peterson Institute study shows that American consumers ended up paying an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 due to the tariffs, which reduced their spending on other goods.   In his book No Apology, Romney said Obama's action ""may make good politics by repaying unions for their support of his campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers. Protectionism stifles productivity"".   Yet in a tight race, Romney knows that such common sense is political poison. So he says what he thinks the voters want to hear. That is also why Romney felt so defenseless when he was accused by Obama of investing in companies that are pioneers in outsourcing to China.   When I talked to Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a US think tank, he said the two candidates cannot be honest because most Americans, in fact most people anywhere, don't understand economics all that well.   For politicians in the US, cashing in on this ignorance helps win votes.   Americans take the honesty of their presidents seriously. They launched a crusade against Bill Clinton in 1998 for lying about his affairs with a White House intern Monica Lewinsky. But it seems that lying blatantly and repeatedly during the presidential campaign is a different kettle of fish.   After all, no more than half the American public trust Obama or Romney, and only 6 percent have a confidence in Congress, according to Gallup and The Harris Poll.

Blame-game players should apologize,10/12/2012,"                         Regardless of who wins the Nov 6 election, US President Barack Obama and the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, both owe Chinese people an apology for their indecent use of fearmongering about the Asia nation in their campaigns.   Both candidates have tried hard and often to use China as a bogeyman, by spreading confrontational or hateful messages about China in their speeches and TV ads.   It recalls the Japan-bashing the United States resorted to in the 1980s, when a fast-growing Japan was seen as an economic threat to the US. Japan, a US ally, was treated unfairly, so perhaps it's not surprising that China, with its different social and political system, has fallen prey to the political rhetoric of the pre-election grandstanding of the two candidates.   However, US politicians seem to blame China as a way of avoiding any responsibility for their nation's problems: its huge national debt, trade deficit and high unemployment.   In his first debate with Obama a week ago, Romney indulged in his customary anti-China rhetoric. While talking about his five measures to create jobs, he said he would ""crack down on China, if and when they cheat"", as if China is the cause of the US' trade problem.   Of course, neither Romney nor Obama have told Americans that China is the fastest-growing export market for US goods and services: That it supports millions of American jobs.   Commenting on his country's budget deficit, Romney said he would cut spending based on whether a program was so critical it was ""worth borrowing money from China to pay for it"". Does that mean Romney will not cut programs so long as he can borrow from countries other than China?   Obama and Romney each accuse the other of outsourcing US jobs to China. But when I asked 3M's China chief Kenneth Yu on Monday whether he knew that 3M could be condemned in the US as an outsourcer, his answer was succinct: If 3M had not grown its China business so much, many high-paying 3M jobs in the US and in other parts of the world would have been lost. You hardly hear such truth in the US these days.   The fearmongering of China in the US reminds me of the old days in China when people would blame everything on US imperialists and their running dogs in Western Europe.   But today, Chinese leaders and people have a much healthier mindset. They have abandoned the blame game now favored by many US politicians.   In fact, they could easily blame Americans for outsourcing, not their jobs, but their polluting manufacturing to China.   The US House Intelligence Committee released a draft report this week on the national security threat posed by Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE. Should China return the favor by arguing against US firms operating in China? Should it issue a warning about Cisco for posing a potential national security threat? How about Boeing, General Electric, Caterpillar and a host of US companies that could be implicated due to their business ties with the US military? How about Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Western Union and Bank of America? These financial firms cut their services to WikiLeaks in December 2010 under pressure from the US government. Who knows whether they would do this to China if tensions rose between the two countries.   Bashing China has become a popular pastime for many Americans. In The Wall Street Journal last Friday, Peter Culp and Robert Glennon claimed the US' alfalfa exports to China were contributing to the water shortage in the west of the country. They chose not to mention that Japan and the United Arab Emirates were the top two US alfalfa buyers last year.   After the election, both Obama and Romney should apologize to China for playing their blame game.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

United States blind to its own faults,9/22/2012,"                           Many people believe that the beauty of the US political system is its ability to correct itself. Things going astray will ultimately be put right they say.   Not really.   Looking back over the past decade, it is clear that if there ever was such a mechanism it is no longer working and there has been an absence of much needed self-criticism.   This was brought into sharp focus when protests against the United States erupted in Egypt and Libya last week, and the US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed. Anti-US demonstrations and riots have now spread across the Muslim world, triggered largely by the anti-Islam movie, Innocence of Muslims.   In the US, the blame has been put on a small group of Islamic extremists in the Middle East and those foreign governments which the US claims have not reacted forcefully to the situation.   US government officials, pundits and even the media keep repeating the same old mantra that the majority of the people in the Middle East and the Islamic world welcome Americans. The US media has frequently cited Christopher Stevens' words that ""Americans, French and British are enjoying unusual popularity"".   Such soothing words are nice, yet a survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that there was a great deal of anger at US policies and Americans in many Muslim nations.   While this may come as a shock to most Americans, it explains why there have been such strong and widespread anti-US protests since last week.   The US needs to take a good hard look at its foreign policy if it is to change such attitudes. For example, the US has long been seen in the Arab world as leaning toward Israel in the Mideast peace process.   Then there is the decade-long war on terror. Waged largely in the two Muslim nations of Iraq and Afghanistan, the war has alienated the Muslim world. On the contrary, a significant number of people in these places view al-Qaida and its ilk favorably. Many even believe that suicide attacks against Americans and other Westerners are justifiable.   Drone attacks have also sown seeds of hatred among Muslims, because while US leaders tout the number of terrorist chiefs and insurgents killed by the high-tech weaponry, these assassinations also cause collateral civilian deaths.   There is also much to be reckoned with the US support for the so-called ""Arab Spring"", which produced undesirable outcome even for the Americans. In countries such as Libya, sectarian violence is looming.   In Syria, reports suggest that al-Qaida elements have infiltrated the opposition forces. The US must think twice before it proclaims the leader of another nation ""must go"" and starts to support any opposition.   Republican challenger Mitt Romney and many neo-conservatives like to accuse US President Barack Obama of being too soft and weak in his foreign policy, but in fact he has been way too hawkish, betraying his early promises that his administration would seek talks and reconciliation with the US' adversaries.   Afraid of being labeled as weak, Obama has been eager to show how tough he is. He sent an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, stepped up drone attacks and poured huge resources to hunt down Osama bin Laden and eventually kill him.   US politicians like to claim that people attack the US and its policies because they hate freedom and democracy. But they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Such a simple mindset and unwillingness to take a look at what the US is doing is unlikely to help the US win friends in the Muslim world.

All that nonsense about outsourcing,9/14/2012,"                                 Last week at the Democratic National Convention, held in Charlotte, North Carolina, a woman peddling bumper stickers outside the event's venue shouted to passers-by: ""Not Made in China"".   I turned back and gave her a questioning look. I asked myself: Should I try to debate her?   At the convention itself, various speakers talked of ""stopping the outsourcing of jobs to China"". US President Barack Obama, in his speech, proposed giving tax breaks to US companies that bring jobs back to the country.   At a time when the US unemployment rate hovers above 8 percent, ""outsourcing"" has become even more of a dirty word in the United States than in other industrialized nations.   These days, one gets an extremely strong sense that Americans are desperate to keep all of the jobs they can. What's more, they want to take back jobs lost in the past, not only from China, but also from India and Mexico. Americans are willing to do almost anything - assemble cars, stitch together clothing, even make toys.   In China, meanwhile, increases in production costs are causing certain labor-intensive jobs to leave Shanghai and other big Chinese cities and go to countries where labor costs are lower.   One important thing to keep in mind here is that if the US citizens who want these jobs insist on being paid their country's minimum wage, which amounts to about $7.25 an hour, their employers won't be able to compete successfully in the global market. They'll just go bust, causing more US jobs to be lost.   The technology company Apple Inc could see such a fate befall it. With a market capitalization of more than $600 billion, it has become the largest US business in history. Yet, if it did not have more than 1 million Chinese workers inexpensively producing components for it at Foxconn, Apple's partner in China, Americans would probably have to pay twice or three times as much for the iPhones and iPads they buy. Without the help of those workers, the iPhone 5, which will hit the market on Sept 21, would probably be priced at $499 for the 16 gigabyte version, instead of the planned $199, and $899 for the 64 gigabyte version, instead of $399.   And that's not all. The US firm would also find itself losing market share to its rivals, Nokia and Samsung, a development that would result in even further job losses in the US.   Ironically, Apple Inc, like many big US companies that have turned to outsourcing, has said it has brought many job opportunities to its home country. A report released in March this year shows that Apple products have led to the addition and support of more than half a million jobs in the US, including 47,000 for direct employees of Apple, 257,000 at companies that support Apple devices and another 210,000 in companies that are in the business of making applications for those devices.   While Apple dazzles the business world and its products shine in stores, low-waged Chinese workers' great contributions and sacrifices have often been overlooked or denigrated. And the environmental damage that Apple's supply chain causes in China is not often taken into consideration.   That's why people become angry when they see that a victim is receiving blame, rather than sympathy, from those who are reaping huge profits. To them, it seems as if the biggest beneficiaries are simply ungrateful.   What makes me even angrier is seeing droves of Chinese people ""shop 'til they drop"" for luxury goods in the US and Europe. A recent report from the financial services company HSBC shows that Chinese customers are the source of a substantial portion of these companies' revenues. Yet the Chinese workers who make some of these luxury goods are still paid minimum wages.   Benoit Cezard, a French amateur photographer, has produced a fun little series of photos named China 2050, which are meant to portray what the future might look like if foreigners found they had to start taking the hard jobs now performed by migrant workers.   When that day comes and China begins outsourcing labor-intensive and polluting industries to the US or Europe, can we blame the outsourcers in the same way some US people do now?

Personal promotion and party zealots,9/7/2012,"                                       As an observer seeing the US Democratic Party's national convention for the first time, I have been witness this week to a sort of cult of personality.   Sellers have lined up every morning outside the Charlotte Convention Center, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Democrats are holding their national convention, and peddled a dazzling array of souvenirs related to US President Barack Obama: portraits, T-shirts, caps, aprons, mugs, golf balls and children's books.   Their wares also include buttons representing people in almost any imaginable line of work or group, from Truckers for Obama, Bartenders for Obama, Contractors for Obama, Fishermen for Obama and Realtors for Obama to Surfers for Obama, Hipsters for Obama and Cat Lovers for Obama.   One particular T-shirt had a picture of Obama on the front and a list of what his supporters deem his accomplishments on its back. Mentioned on the list were his work to save the US auto industry and end the war in Iraq, as well as to reform Wall Street and the country's healthcare and student loan systems.   Obama's image also appeared on the cover of a children's book. His face shown with glory, reminding me of portraits of our great leader in former times.   Various delegates and supporters at the convention walked into the event's venue bearing what had to be nearly 100 Obama buttons on their caps, jackets and bags. Quite a few of them were in the 20,000-seat Time Warner Arena, where a long list of Democratic leaders and supporters made speeches every day from 5 pm to 11 pm.   The crowds applauded loudly before, during and after each speech. They chanted ""Four More Years"" and ""Forward"", Obama's campaign slogan for this year.   Except for a few, most of the speakers had the same messages. Obama is not just a caring leader, but also one who is also capable and who possesses a vision. His successes of the past four years make him deserving of another four years in the White House. The Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, on the other hand, cares primarily about the rich.   I didn't go to Tampa, Florida, last week to observe the Republican national convention. Watching it on TV instead, I found the Republicans had nearly the opposite message: Obama has failed in the past four years and does not deserve another term.   Both sides are proficient, as they have demonstrated, at attacking each other. They seem to have no difficulty convincing their supporters who should be the next president.   Yet, isn't this merely preaching to the choir? The outcome of this tight race will depend on which candidate can win over the most undecided voters. A person can hardly succeed in this contest by praising himself and avoiding all self-criticism. After all, an election is a serious business and not a talk show.   Neither candidate, for instance, has responded well to the grievances expressed by those in the Occupy Wall Street and anti-war movements, even though people representing both have marched in Charlotte every day of the Democratic convention. The protestors have complained about abuses of money in politics and have called for an end to drone strikes in foreign countries, as well for the release of Bradley Manning, the US Army soldier who is awaiting trial for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks.   Some of the protesters I talked to expressed frustration with everyone who is in power. They were unhappy with Obama and said the Republicans are even worse.   It reminded me of my next-door neighbor, a retired professor. On his door is a sticker with the word ""Forward"" printed on it. When I asked him about his views about the two candidates, he said, half jokingly, that he'll have to vote for the lesser of two evils. Americans seem no less frustrated with party politics in Washington than with the country's stagnant economy.   Obama is finding it difficult to convince US citizens that he deserves another four years in office. Romney's task is equally hard.   The frenzied party politics I saw at the national conventions simply need to cool down.   The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

An end to the revival of hostilities,8/31/2012,"                                       At an event on Tuesday in New York marking the 40th anniversary of ""Ping-Pong Diplomacy"", three guests told of how that initial campaign toward re-establishing normalized relations between the United States and China in the early 1970s led to an end of decades of hostility between the countries.   Among those who spoke of that historic period was Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, whose secret trip to China in July 1971 had been preceded by one by the US table tennis team. Then there was Jan Berris, vice-president of the National Committee on US-China Relations, who, while on a one-year leave from the State Department, had worked tirelessly at the time of Ping-Pong Diplomacy to prepare an adequate reception for a reciprocal visit that was to be made by the Chinese ping-pong team. Even further memories came from George Brathwaite, a member of the US team that went to China.   Making a sharp contrast to the message put forth by these three speakers are the words we often hear coming from US politicians. In the days and weeks leading up to the Republican National Convention this week in Tampa, Florida, various speakers, ranging from the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, to the Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, and to another former secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, have tried to sow the seeds of hostility between the two countries.   Not everyone is fooled by such talk. One day after a recent condemnation Ryan made of China's trade practices, the Wall Street Journal reminded the congressman in an editorial that 420 of the US' 435 congressional districts saw their exports to China accelerate at a faster rate in 2011 than to any other market in the world.   And when Rice, in a speech she delivered on Wednesday night in Tampa, blamed China and Russia for the escalating conflict in Syria, noting that they had vetoed a recent UN resolution, her words reminded me of a conversation I had this week had with a Middle East specialist in the US State Department. Both of us sighed at the thought of proposals to further arm the opposition forces in Syria, knowing that to do so would only lead to more bloodshed.   Although the US has publicly said it won't supply lethal weapons to Syrian rebels, many reports suggest that it has at least helped to bring them within that group's reach.   Neoconservatives such as Rice surely want to see more aggressive steps taken, perhaps something akin to the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and ensuing regime changes in both countries. Yet, most people around the world, including many Americans, already know the US has failed dismally in those campaigns.   Accusations of China being a warmonger are also totally unfounded. Recent decades have seen the US fighting war after war. China, in contrast, has not been in one since its border conflict with Vietnam in 1979.   Many US analysts have said the harsh stances Romney and Ryan have taken on China have no foundation in reality. For one, the US business community, which sees huge benefits from trade with China, does not like the confrontational stances Romney often takes, such as when he says he plans to label China a currency manipulator the first day he takes office as president.   One good sign is that Robert Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state and former president of the World Bank, has been appointed to lead the transition team Romney will charge with handling affairs of national security.   Zoellick's appointment has been the subject of fierce attacks from many neocons. Some even speculate that Zoellick, known as a foreign policy realist, will be appointed Secretary of State if Romney is elected.   To such hard-liners, Zoellick may seem too soft. That may only mean he will prove someone who is capable of stamping out the hostility that some US politicians are trying to ignite between China and the US - the kind of hostility that people such as Kissinger, Berris and Brathwaite strived hard to end 40 years ago.

Witch hunt of Assange a shame,8/24/2012,"                                       It is now not certain if the foreign ministers from the Organization of American States who are meeting in Washington on Friday will support the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has spent the last nine weeks in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.   The United States, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago have all questioned if the Assange case is relevant to the OAS, while 23 members of the organization have said they are in favor of holding the meeting.   All signs indicate that Ecuador President Rafael Correa has been not only courageous but also right to protect Assange from possible persecution for his part in releasing a trove of US diplomatic cables in 2010. They also suggest that the sexual assault charges that have been levied against Assange are a smoke screen meant to hide plans to extradite him to the US.   One thing is clear. Both Sweden and Britain, when approached by Ecuador, have refused to guarantee that Assange will not be extradited to the US. The US has also not said that it will refrain from taking revenge on Assange for the huge embarrassment that leaks subjected it to.   If there is no conspiracy among these three countries to secure an extradition, why wouldn't they give such an assurance?   There are other questions to be asked. Why, for instance, would the British and Swedish governments go to such lengths in a case involving sexual assault charges?   Victoria Nuland, spokeswoman for the US State Department, has said that Assange was making ""wild assertions"" when he said the US was engaged in a ""witch hunt"" against WikiLeaks. If that's the case, why do so many people see Ecuador's action as constituting an offense that the US might retaliate against?   Britain's assertion that it can legally storm the Ecuadorean embassy in London, under a little-known law that was adopted in 1987, is shocking. If Britain does indeed violate the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, it will not only tarnish its own image but also set a bad example for other countries that find themselves in similar situations.   Apparently, the US likes neither Assange nor President Correa, an economist who was educated in both Europe and the US.   Correa's decision to close the US military base in Ecuador several years ago offended many people in Washington. In a previous interview with Assange, Correa said: ""It's not a problem to set up a US base in Ecuador. We can give the go-ahead as long as we are granted permission to set up an Ecuadorian military base in Miami. If it's not an issue, they should agree.""   Assange himself has been the target of harsh words uttered by everyone from President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Senator John McCain. There is no sign that they have decided to not punish him.   It is surprising that news organizations such as the New York Times, which published selective cables provided by WikiLeaks about two years ago, have not come out in support of Assange. But if you recall that the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press and other news organizations refrained early last year from reporting that Raymond Davis, who killed two men in a shootout in Pakistan, was a contractor for the CIA, you can see just how much we should trust the US government and media.   There is no doubt that Assange is a courageous journalist. Punishing him for what he has done would have a chilling effect on investigative journalists.   I can only guess US government officials would be saying exactly the same things if the trove of diplomatic cables released weren't American.

Money talks in US presidential race,8/11/2012,"                                The Occupy Wall Street protest last year was against money in politics. It is not difficult to figure why if you have been following the 2012 US presidential campaign.   US President Barack Obama has stepped up his campaign despite being head of a state haunted by a huge national debt, high jobless rate and serious droughts. He appeared in multiple campaign events in Connecticut on Monday, Washington DC on Tuesday and Colorado on Wednesday.   Last Monday, Obama caused a traffic snarl in New York City when he returned for a $40,000-a-head fundraiser after having raised $4.5 million at a star-studded event at actress Sarah Jessica Parker's house in Manhattan about seven weeks ago.   Obama is apparently trying to catch up with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who has raised more funds than him three months in a row. In July, Romney raised $101 million against Obama's $75 million.   But between January and June, Obama outspent Romney $400 million to $131 million.   Last month, Obama attended 21 fundraisers, in addition to 17 campaign-themed public events. It seemed odd to see him promising to help poor and middle-class Americans at grassroots campaign events in the day and wining and dining with Wall Street financiers, Hollywood celebrities and rich liberal groups at fancy restaurants at night.   While some Republicans have dubbed Obama ""Campaign-in-Chief"", their candidate Romney's schedule is just as busy. He campaigned in Illinois on Tuesday and Iowa on Wednesday.   Obama's top contributors include Microsoft, University of California and Harvard University. The big donors for Romney are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Surely, both candidates believe the amount of money they raise will be crucial to winning the election. It has allowed them to spend an unprecedented amount of money running negative advertisements against each other in the past months, especially in the battleground states of Ohio and Florida.   In Cleveland, Ohio, for example, an average viewer is seeing 87 presidential campaign spots on TV a week, compared with 70 in Orlando, Florida.   By spreading mostly biased or untrue stories about their rivals in the negative ads, both candidates seem to firmly believe that a lie repeated often becomes the truth.   Of course, many nasty ads are paid for by the so-called Super PACs, usually big money from corporations and the rich. A Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case in 2010 entitled corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money in US elections, both at federal and local levels.   The increasing role played by money in politics has sparked an outcry among some Americans. They say democracy is now on sale to the highest bidder.   In an op-ed piece on Tuesday, former US Labor Secretary Robert Reich, a long-time critic of concentrated wealth and corrupt politics in the US, called on people to fight the buyers and sellers of American democracy.   Money has already changed the nature of democracy and free election, which the US claims to champion and intends to spread across the world.   But if democracy and free election are all about how much money you can raise and how nasty you can get in negative ads, as is evident in this presidential race, I am not sure what kind of exemplary power the US is.   What I am sure of is that in the run-up to the November election, the exemplary power of money in politics will only multiply.   The author, based in New York, is Deputy Editor of China Daily USA.

The big profits made in the USA,7/21/2012,"                        Perhaps US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid should run for president this year as he seems to have the solution to the United States' high unemployment problem. Something President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney don't seem to have any answers to.   Reid's solution would be to turn the 8.2 percent of the population that are jobless into hardworking garment workers. At least that is what the 72-year-old Democratic Senator from Nevada seemed to be suggesting last week after learning that Team USA will be going to the 2012 London Olympics wearing stylish Ralph Lauren uniforms that have been made in China.   ""I am so upset. I think the Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves. I think they should be embarrassed. I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them, and start all over again,"" Reid said.   He was later joined in his outrage by more Congressional Democrats, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. On Monday, a group of Senate Democrats introduced a bill that requires all US Olympic team uniforms to be made in the US.   Perhaps the Democrats should introduce another bill that requires all Senators to set an example and wear made-in-the-USA from top to bottom in order to demonstrate their patriotism. However, if it came into law today, most, if not all, would find themselves going around naked and barefoot.   Senator Reid's so-called patriotism is actually rather unpatriotic. He wants to revive the economy by restoring the labor-intensive garment industry in the US, which means he wants the US to take a step backwards and join the ranks of developing economies, such as China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam, the big labor-intensive garment producing nations of the Third World.   But if Reid's idea of bringing garment manufacturing back to the US was actually realized, all of the US clothing firms, including Ralph Lauren, would soon go bust because of the high labor costs in the US. Of course, they can console themselves with the thought that they died a martyr and no doubt Reid would eulogize their passing.   Reid, a lawyer by training, does not seem to understand the basic economic principle of comparative advantage, despite his decades of service on Capitol Hill. The production part of the garment industry, which is now done by developing countries such as China, only retains a fraction of the profits in the supply chain; the big money is made in design, technology, distribution, marketing and sales, most of which are done by US businesses.   In that sense, US companies are making the right decision in a free market economy instead of following the path of insanity Reid wants them to take.   Reid's nonsense aside, what struck me most is the silence of the people who should know full well such ideas are madness. Obama and Romney, who probably know better, and other political leaders, who clearly disagree, are afraid to speak up for fear of being labeled ""unpatriotic"" or ""un-American"".   However, Ralph Lauren and the US Olympic Committee have been forced to compromise by announcing that Team USA for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games will be outfitted with made-in-the-USA uniforms. This is quite scary in a country that claims to champion freedom of speech and a free market economy.   Senator Reid has not replied to my question about whether he regretted making the outrageous comment. I hope when the Team USA parades in the opening ceremony in London next Friday, Americans feel proud of the athletes in their uniforms. They might even offer thanks to the hard-working Chinese garment workers in Dalian for making such splendid uniforms.   The author, based in New York, is Deputy Editor of China Daily USA.

Candidates happy to play the blame game,7/13/2012,"                                 We all know Mitt Romney, the 2012 US Republican presidential candidate, is saying that if he wins the election he will get tough on China from his first day in office.   From last weekend, we heard that we'd got it wrong, Romney had actually been working for China by outsourcing American jobs to China during his years at the helm of private equity firm Bain Capital.   In his latest campaign advertisement, US President Barack Obama accuses Romney's firm of being a ""pioneer in shipping US jobs overseas, investing in firms that specialize in relocating jobs done by American workers to new facilities in low-wage countries like China"".   To emphasize Romney's sin, the narrator in Obama's ad changes his tone when saying ""China"".   The 30-second ad concludes by stating, Romney is ""not the solution. He's the problem"".   Just as Obama has turned up the heat on Romney for outsourcing American jobs abroad, he himself has become the target of pro-labor organizations for outsourcing jobs. Robert Scott of the liberal Economic Policy Institute said the growth of Chinese exports to the US from 2008 to 2010 cost 450,000 American jobs.   Scott seems to believe that Americans should have a totally self-reliant economy. He seems not to believe in the basic economic principle of comparative advantages, and the same seems true of Obama and Romney, as they try to blame each other for the outsourcing of American jobs.   Obama and Romney should probably both hire Lou Dobbs as their campaign manager. Dobbs, who worked for a long time at CNN, is now a Fox business anchor. He has long been a crusader against American companies outsourcing jobs overseas.   But this is all nonsense. I don't think either Obama or Romney really believes that outsourcing is bad for the US. In fact, all the statistics show that outsourcing has benefited the US enormously by letting the nation do what it does best. And anyone who thinks Chinese exports are bad for the US should know US exports to China have grown faster than to any other country.   It's not difficult to figure out how this farce began. When Obama and Romney each blame the other for the lack of American jobs, it is really because neither of them has a solution to the US' economic woes to offer the American people. They have decided that the best thing they can do is to try and divert attention by blaming someone else for the problem. China, sadly, has been selected by many US politicians as the ideal bogeyman to scare their people.   I don't know how long this farce will last, but the ordinary Americans I have talked to are increasingly frustrated by their top politicians who have been doing things for their own purposes rather than for the good of the nation.   For Obama and Romney, the most important thing is to get re-elected or elected. To achieve that goal, they are running incessant ads, repeating biased messages demonizing their rival and making China the scapegoat.   Just as the US National Debt, shown on the Internal Revenue Service screen in Times Square near my office, hit $15.8698 trillion this week, Obama was begging supporters to give more to his campaign after learning Romney had raised more money for two consecutive months.   Obama sounds desperate in his message to his patrons this week: ""We can win a race in which the other side spends more than we do, but not this much more.""   Money is always a factor in the US presidential race, but both candidates have bet on the ""China card"" for victory, which is misleading the public.

Future will be the one we make now,6/15/2012,"                                 I am very excited about my first trip to Brazil, partly because I can finally practice the Portuguese I have been studying for the past few months.   Of course, Brazil is more than just the language. To me, it is the country of samba, soccer and Corcovado, with its giant statue of Jesus. A land of abundant resources, fertile land and the Amazon; a land of the future as Austrian author Stefan Zweig called it.   The South American nation, the fifth largest country in the world, has much of what the rest of the world needs for a sustainable future.   That is probably why the leaders of more than 130 countries will gather in Rio de Janeiro for the Rio+20, the short name for the UN Conference on Sustainable Development, to shape ways to reduce poverty, advance social equity and ensure environmental protection to create to a safer, cleaner, greener and fairer world.   More than 50,000 people from around the world are expected to flood into Rio in the coming days, with world leaders, along with thousands of participants from governments, the private sector, NGOs and other groups attending hundreds of events.   Rio+20 is taking place 20 years after the Earth Summit held in Rio in 1992, where landmark global agreements on climate change, forests and biodiversity were produced.   But these agreements have not achieved their desired results. Over the past few years, world leaders at climate change talks have failed to show a commitment strong enough to avoid the possible worst-case scenario.   That is discouraging and expectations for Rio+20 have fallen even further with the announcement that US President Barack Obama has decided not to attend the summit despite the repeated urgings of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Obama will send Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead.   In the US, such an arrangement has let down many environmentalists and people like Jeffrey Sachs, the director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University and a special advisor to the UN Secretary-General on Millennium Development Goals. Sachs predicted in a seminar in New York on Monday that neither US presidential candidates, Obama or Mitt Romney, are likely to mention the word ""climate change"" in the coming four months leading up to the November election. In Sachs' eyes, any serious talk among grown-ups has become impossible among politicians in the United States today.   While the lack of clear and strong leadership from the US is indeed a blow to the global endeavor, leaders of the more than 130 countries should be commended for attending the summit.   Yes, the challenges are huge and many. As reported, countries are still haggling over the draft of the summit outcome document known as ""The Future We Want"". Yet the world will move forward when leaders show their willingness to talk about the issues and share best practices in developing a green economy, instead of shying away from the challenges.   The official discussions will focus on how to build a green economy to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty, and how to improve international coordination for sustainable development.   This is especially necessary given the global economic recession. The possible fallout from the Greek election this coming Sunday, in which Greece may leave the eurozone, has probably already caused many world leaders sleepless nights.   Meanwhile, developing countries, China included, still face huge pressure to reduce poverty and improve the livelihoods of its people. Following a green path of development might mean slower growth and more expensive growth given all the strict environmental standards to be enforced. Unfortunately that seems to be a necessity for the world today.   The developed nations have left a heavy historical burden on the planet. The developing nations no longer have the luxury of repeating that kind of mistake.   After all, we don't want to leave our children and grandchildren in a land with no future.

Obama's 'Whac-A-Mole' approach abhorrent,6/9/2012,"                        US President Barack Obama likes to talk about the ""to do"" list he has for the US Congress. He is calling on them ""to take action to create jobs and help the middle class"". The five-point list covers tax incentives, mortgages and clean energy in order to sustain economic growth. He has talked about the list on every possible occasion while campaigning for his re-election during the last few weeks, and it is featured prominently on the White House website.   However, there is one list Obama has studiously shied away from in the past 10 days. That is his infamous ""to kill"" list, when as commander-in-chief he oversees the regular Tuesday counterterrorism meetings of security officials in the White House selecting targets for drone attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia.   Obama's unusual silence about the list is possibly because the Senate is proposing to hold hearings on the leaking of ""classified information"".   That may also explain why most US news organizations have not shown the kind of excitement they normally would for such a sensational story. Instead, they have paid more attention to the trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape.   Yet the public in both the US and other parts of the world, especially in countries where the drone attacks take place, are waiting impatiently for an explanation from the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner.   Obama has authorized hundreds of drone attacks since taking office in 2009, many times more than the number of strikes authorized during George W. Bush's term in office. The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Obama has launched at least 275 drone strikes in Pakistan alone.   The Bureau of Investigative Journalism based in London estimates that up to 830 civilians, including many women and children, might have been killed by drone attacks in Pakistan, 138 in Yemen and 57 in Somalia, while hundreds more have been injured.   From time to time, news of high-profile terrorist suspects killed in drone attacks make the headlines, but what is usually missing is that these men's wives and children are often ""collateral damage"".   In fact, the stupidity of the drone attacks is self-evident. The killing of anyone in the vicinity of the ""target"", including civilians, is sowing the seeds of hatred among the local populations. We have seen that from the strong protests against US drones from the people and governments in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen.   Obama's image as a principled man and a promoter of peace has been irrevocably damaged by the revelation that he is ""hands-on"" when it comes to drone strikes.   As the New York Times observed: ""Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top secret 'nominations' process to designate terrorists for kill or capture, of which the capture part has become largely theoretical.""   Obama once aggressively criticized Bush for his drone program and vowed during his 2008 campaign to close the Guantanamo detention camp, where people are being held without due process. But he has not kept any of these promises.   Given the growing frustration among his core supporters over these issues, it is not clear how many Democrats are going to campaign as passionately for Obama as they did in 2008.   Obama is trying to show he is tough. But instead he has shown he is prepared to kill women and children, and he does it every week on Tuesday.   It's time to recall Obama's Nobel Peace Prize.

US politicians playing a foolish game,6/1/2012,"                        People in China get upset by the China-bashing rhetoric of people like Mitt Romney, who won the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, or the celebrity businessman, Donald Trump.      But is it worth getting angry at their crowd-pleasing antics? I think it is better just to ignore them.    Even the conservative political columnist George Will has dismissed Trump. Commenting over the weekend on Romney and Trump, Will said: ""Donald Trump is redundant evidence that if your net worth is high enough, your IQ can be very low and you can still intrude into American politics.""   Some US journalists believe that TV stations invite Trump on their programs simply to show how ridiculous he is. And if that is the case, why should we take it seriously when Trump screams - ""China is ripping off the United States""?   The same is true of Romney and many other American politicians. On the sidelines of a recent seminar hosted by the National Committee on US-China Relations, I asked former US Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman why he endorses Romney whose China policy he totally disagrees with.   Huntsman's action reminded people that he supports Romney for the sake of his own political career, he said that he is not sure if Romney has fully articulated his China policy yet. In Huntsman's eyes, what we have heard from Romney so far is simply campaign rhetoric.   That also includes Romney's article in the Wall Street Journal in mid February, titled ""How I'll Respond to China's Rising Power"", where he threatened a trade war with China and described President Barack Obama as a near supplicant to Beijing.   Even Huntsman then described Romney's China policy as outlined in this article as ""wrongheaded"".   ""When it comes to China, I think it's wrongheaded to suggest slapping a tariff on day one. That pushes aside the reality, the complexity of the relationship It's much easier to talk about China in terms of the fear factor than the opportunity factor,"" he said.   At the recent seminar, Huntsman described what happened onstage during the Republican presidential debate as an example.   In the far corner of the stage, one candidate said,'as president, I would declare war on China.' The crowd went carzy.""  The next candidate said that when he became president he would slap tariffs on China. There was a round of applause after this. However, when Huntsman tried to explain the reality of the relationship, there was no applause, no cheering.   The really painful moment came when former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean asked Huntsman at the meeting to name the people in Congress who understand the relationship Huntsman was talking about, and even more importantly those who are willing to move the relationship forward in an intelligent way.   Huntsman felt hard pressed to name even a few. In his eyes, politicians find it easier to portray China as the bogeyman for political leverage, especially during an election.   He was quite upset by politicians distorting the relationship and pandering to the public's prejudices in this way. But his own unwillingness to cater to the popular perception in the US of China as a threat cut short his own campaign.   Huntsman's suggestion is a bottom-up model that would make the China-US relationship more relevant to ordinary people in the US. Until that happens, politicians in the US will continue to be cheered whenever they resort to China bashing.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Greater tolerance and equal rights,5/12/2012,"                          US Vice-President Joe Biden's remark on Sunday that he felt ""absolutely comfortable"" with letting gays and lesbians marry, led to President Barack Obama announcing that he supported same-sex marriages on Wednesday.   Hopefully, Obama too now feels ""comfortable"" after he told ABC News on Wednesday that he thinks same-sex couples should be able to get married.   Although he said he would have preferred to make his views known ""in my own way, on my own terms without, I think, there being a lot of notice"".   Obama had been dodging the question since he became president, by saying that his view on the issue was ""evolving"".   It's no secret that the gay and lesbian community is among the sources of funds for his re-election campaign and has long been disappointed by his ambiguity.   It's also no secret that worry over the possible loss of voters was the reason he had tried to dodge the issue. In fact, the people running Obama's campaign are probably still trying to calculate the fallout of his statement on Wednesday.   But for a person who claims to have integrity and principle, nothing should be more important than to be truthful to himself and to tell what he really believes. This is what should make Obama feel so good and proud about his statement.   So far most US states still prohibit same-sex marriages. The latest was North Carolina where people in large numbers voted on Tuesday in favor of a constitutional amendment, which bans same-sex marriage as well as civil unions.   By coincidence, Obama's Wednesday announcement came just a few hours after I watched a YouTube video calling for equal gay rights. Titled ""It could happen to you,"" the video tells a tragic story of a young gay man Shane whose life was torn apart due to family and social discrimination. His partner, Tom, finally jumped from a rooftop and killed himself.   Yet all over the United States, support for gay marriage has been rising. Same-sex marriage has become legal in six US states and the District of Columbia. It will become effective in the state of Washington on June 7 and Maryland at the beginning of next year.   A Pew Research Center survey conducted last month shows that 47 percent favor legal marriage for gay and lesbian couples while 43 percent are opposed. That compares to 2004 when 31 percent were in favor and almost 60 percent were opposed.   Earlier Pew surveys also show that support for gay marriages is a generational thing - the younger the group, the more support.   In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been championing gay equal rights. And in the pride parade last year, Bloomberg, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and other local leaders and celebrities marched down Fifth Avenue with thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.   I don't think any Obama supporters should change their votes because of his Wednesday statement. While they may disagree on gay marriage issue, they should also celebrate that they have an honest leader. And honesty should be rewarded, not punished.   Watching this new chapter of equal rights unfolding in the US, I cannot help thinking of the millions of gays and lesbians in China, most of whom could still be facing prejudice from their families and society.   The first Shanghai Pride Festival in 2009 was a positive step forward, but public support has still been lacking for such events and campaigns.   While the country is clearly not yet ready for same-sex marriages, life for China's homosexuals has improved markedly since homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 and removed from the official list of psychological disorders in 2002.   But, unlike the US, there are still no laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. There is still much that needs to be done to make society inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

US media belittle issue of inequality,5/5/2012,"                                    Although International Workers' Day on May 1 was created to commemorate the general strike in Chicago for an eight-hour workday in 1886, it is no longer a national holiday in the United States, as it is in many other countries.   But that does not mean nothing happened in the US on Tuesday. In New York and many other US cities, it was marked by a general strike led by the Occupy Wall Street movement.   In New York the angry protesters in Bryant Park included an old lady in a wheelchair and a 9-year-old girl who accompanied her father in the morning rain, as well as the Guitarmy, a group of guitarists led by Grammy-winner Tom Morello. In Madison Square Park, dozens of professors of the so-called Free University gave lectures and workshops that attracted people of different ages.   That was in addition to the many small groups of protesters picketing outside corporate headquarters in Manhattan, such as the one outside the Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street, which had a strong police barricade. The day culminated with thousands of people marching down Broadway in the late afternoon from Union Square to Wall Street.   They were all protesting, as I learned when I talked to a diverse group including the 9-year-old girl Jude Rollison, about political, social and economic inequality. It has been the consistent message of the Occupy Wall Street movement since it was born in downtown Zuccotti Park on Sept 17 last year.   A Pew Center poll released two months ago found that 66 percent of Americans believe there are ""very strong"" or ""strong"" conflicts between the rich and the poor in the country, an increase of 19 percentage points since 2009, while a recent Gallup poll found that 70 percent of people think it extremely or very important that the federal government in Washington enact policies that increase the equality of opportunity so that people can get ahead.   According to a study based on World Bank data, the US was found to be in the bottom third of the list of 90 countries for economic inequality, well behind Europe, Canada and South Korea.   The inequality has also become a presidential campaign issue with President Barack Obama trying to cash in on the issue to raise taxes on the wealthy.   Such growing inequality is indeed a serious issue not only for the US, but for China and many other countries. In China, the growing inequality that has developed during the past three decades also calls for drastic action in the coming years before it runs out of control.   However, if you read the major newspapers in New York city on May 2, you would find the protest had little coverage, a big contrast to their enthusiastic and lengthy reporting on smaller-scale protests in other countries.   The New York Times only had a 300-word story in the middle of an inside page emphasizing the inconvenience caused to traffic, the clashes and arrests, surprisingly making no mention of the real issues raised by protesters. None of the Times' columnists, such as Thomas Friedman, bothered to write anything about this domestic revolt.   The New York Post, a Rupert Murdoch paper, was probably the most opinionated in such coverage. Its headline ""Protests pretty much a joke, despite skirmishes with cops"" shows its attitude to the underprivileged in American society. Its one-sided news report was supplemented with an editorial titled ""Goodbye, Occupy.""   However, this is wishful thinking by the New York Post as the movement won't go away anytime soon as long as the political, social and economic inequality in the US keeps worsening.   What is sure is that the inequality will only grow when news media refuse to speak for the underprivileged they are supposed to represent.

Recycling is not a dirty word,4/27/2012,"                                 Americans are often regarded as wasteful people and it has been said that if everyone consumed like people in the United States, it would require the resources of four planet Earths.   This is largely true.   However, the recycling stations and thrift shops I come across in New York defy such an image. They make me feel Americans, or New Yorkers at least, are less wasteful than Chinese people who blissfully believe frugality is an inherent virtue of the nation even as they consume and discard.   For example, in Manhattan's Union Square Greenmarket every Saturday and Monday, you can see a tent, which is a recycling station for textiles. People bring bags of clean used clothing, hats, paired shoes, linens, handbags and belts that they no longer want to the tent for other people to use. The participants, either volunteers at the station or donors, are often young people.   Such recycling stations are available in eight Greenmarkets in New York City. Along with hundreds of thrift shops, secondhand stores, consignment shops and flea markets, they form a huge network where used goods find new owners. And many of the thrift shops are run by charity organizations to benefit the poor and needy, or use the proceeds to help people with AIDS.   In Shanghai, the thrift and secondhand shops, which were popular in the old days, have long gone. The once wildly popular secondhand store in Shanghai known as Huaiguojiu, or Huaihai Road State-owned Secondhand Store, is only a distant memory, so are the hundreds of recycling stations once scattered all over the city.   Now the people who collect unwanted goods are migrant workers riding tricycles, who are unable to provide an effective recycling service.   Unlike New York, where you will find stylish young people selling or buying secondhand clothing in a shop in Brooklyn's cool Williamsburg neighborhood, most Shanghainese refuse to buy or wear used clothing, even vintage items, regarding them as dirty and a loss of face.   While New Yorkers discard some 200,000 tons of textiles a year, Shanghainese reportedly produce 130,000 tons of used clothing annually, much of it ending up in landfills.   The good news is the city has started to place clothing recycling bins in some old residential compounds. But new and upper-scale residential quarters, where the young and wealthy live and where more recyclable clothing is produced, are often not equipped with such facilities.   Considering the enormous pressure on the environment and resources from a fast-growing China, it makes a lot of sense to promote recycling in China.   Meanwhile, China's huge rural and migrant population, who are often at the lowest level of income distribution, mean secondhand items would have a huge market. This huge market should inspire young people to start recycling businesses. Some of the most successful online thrift stores in the US were launched by MBA students.   In line with the national strategy of shifting to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly development mode, the Ministry of Commerce issued guidance last December to promote the development of recycling businesses in China during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-15).   After all, China, the world's second largest economy, is still a developing country, ranking 96th in per capita GDP compared with the US, which is eighth, according to the World Bank. There is simply no reason for Chinese people to be wasteful.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

Beijing's bills or Shanghai's coins?,4/13/2012,"                                 In the United States, a bipartisan Congress group has been pushing for the paper dollar to be replaced with a dollar coin.   The campaign has been supported by a study of the Government Accountability Office which said the government could save about $5.5 billion over 30 years if it replaced dollar bills with coins. Paper bills last about three years on average before being shredded into waste paper. Coins can circulate for some three decades before they are worn out and recycled.   With the US federal deficit exceeding $1 trillion, supporters of the so-called Currency Optimization, Innovation and National Savings Act say it will help solve the debt problem.   ""At a time when we are staring down a record-breaking $1.3 trillion deficit, any commonsense measure that cuts billions needs to be given serious consideration. That is exactly what the COINS Act will do and why I am introducing it,"" said David Schweikert, a member of the House Financial Services Committee and the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy.   However, it will not be easy to make this change.   Support for dollar coins among the American public seems to be lacking: previous efforts to introduce more dollar coins ended up with more coins being held in the Federal Reserve vaults due to their unpopularity.   And while ordinary people might base their preference on which they consider more convenient, there is clearly a tough fight involving complicated economics and politics. The key congressmen supporting the dollar coins come from Arizona, a major supplier of copper for the mints, while some key opponents are from Massachusetts which supplies paper for the dollar bills.   Every time I come from Shanghai to Beijing I am reminded of this coin versus bill debate.   In Beijing, one-yuan coins are less popular than one-yuan bills. If you give a shop assistant several yuan coins, you are likely to receive a frown. Every time I tried to find out why people prefer paper money, I was told that coins are inconvenient.   In Shanghai where one-yuan coins are the norm, the answer is exactly the opposite. Shanghainese not only consider the one-yuan bills inconvenient they also consider them dirty. They like the sound of coins jingling in their pockets.   The preference for coins or bills is not just a manifestation of the rivalry between the two municipalities, nor is it a characteristic of north and south. In Guangzhou in the south, for example, one-yuan bills are more popular than coins, while in Shenyang, a key metropolis in Liaoning province in the northeast, one-yuan coins are preferred.   Some people have suggested that the country's mints, which are located in places such as Shanghai and Nanjing, are linked to the popularity of coins in these regions.   But it is probably a result of the campaign launched by the central bank in 1992 to promote the use of the longer-lasting coins in Shanghai, Jiangsu and neighboring regions.   Ten years ago one of the officials in charge said there has been good progress in promoting the use of coins in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Liaoning. But he admitted it would be a prolonged battle for it to succeed nationwide.   It seems this prolonged battle will last longer than expected if cities like Beijing hold on to the bills.

Rare earth case reveals US hypocrisy,3/15/2012,"                      US President Barack Obama announced on Tuesday that the United States, joined by Japan and the European Union, has filed complaints with the World Trade Organization over China's rare earth export quotas.  He said this as an effort to give ""American workers and American businesses a fair shot in the global economy"".   His words, however, imply that he does not really care about the environmental degradation caused by China's disorderly and excessive mining of rare earth materials, as long as US workers and businesses can profit from China's cheap supply.   This is shocking for a president who likes to portray himself as pro-environment when he fights Republican presidential candidates over clean energy issues, or when he tried to restore the US' leadership role at the UN Climate Change Conference, in Copenhagen, in December 2009.   China's new regulations on rare earth manufacturing and exports, which were introduced a few years ago, are based on the sound rationale of sustainable growth and environmental protection.   With only a third of the world's rare earth deposits, China now produces over 90 percent of the global rare earth minerals, a group of 17 elements that are widely used in high-tech products such as solar panels, batteries for electric cars and cell phones.   The lack of strong regulations in the past has posed grave dangers to the country and its people by depleting natural resources and destroying the environment. For example, rare earth mining has polluted drinking water in regions along some waterways linked to rare earth mines.   Experts believe it will cost tens of billions of dollars to repair the ecosystems damaged by rampant rare earth mining over the past decades. And American, Japanese and European businesses are unlikely to foot the bill.   On the other hand, countries such as the US, Canada and Australia, which used to produce rare earth minerals, stopped such manufacturing a decade ago due to the environmental concerns and the higher cost compared with Chinese exports.   When talking about China's purchase of raw materials from Africa and Latin America, many people in the US and Europe like to use the word ""grabbing resources"" or even ""colonialism"", but none of these people use similar words to describe the West's exploitation of China's cheap rare earth minerals.   This is just hypocrisy.   According to the US Geological Survey, there are about 13 million metric tons of rare earth deposits in the US. Instead of buying from China, Obama should propose tapping the US' own deposits. Such a move would not only enable the US to share the responsibility for the supply of rare earth materials, it would also create jobs for Americans, the single most powerful weapon Obama needs to beat a Republican candidate in November's election.   In filing the WTO case, Obama has to convince people why China should deplete its resources and disregard environmental and public health concerns, issues that are addressed prominently both in China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) and the recent World Report on China.   A win for the US, Japan and the EU in the WTO case would be a loss for the global environmental cause.   The author, based in New York, is deputy editor of China Daily US edition.

Decline of US power only relative,3/10/2012,"                                       A growing number of Americans are displaying anxiety and pessimism about the perception that the United States is in decline on the world stage.   The media are constantly raising the alarm that the US' privilege and prestige are slipping away, and the great minds of the nation are earnestly debating what that means and what can be done.   All this is understandable in the wake of the global financial crisis, which has placed capitalism under scrutiny, and the US' high unemployment, huge national debt, and ballooning budget deficit.   While spending trillions of dollars on the war on terror in the past decade, the US has failed to address such necessary tasks as upgrading its infrastructure and fixing its education system.   This is in stark contrast to the phenomenal growth achieved in the past decade by emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, whose combined GDP is expected to surpass that of the US by 2015.   There is no doubt that these developing nations have become increasingly active on the world stage. They are also demanding a bigger say in global governance.   The strong call for a candidate from a developing nation to replace Robert Zoellic, the World Bank president who will step down in June, is just the most recent example. Traditionally, the head of the international organization charged with reducing poverty and supporting development has been an American, and as such the body has often seemed to be an instrument of US policy.   But the world is different now.   In his new book No One's World: The West, The Rising Rest and the Coming Global Turn, Georgetown University Professor Charles Kupchan argues that the future of the world will not be dominated by the US, China, India, or anyone else.   For the first time in history, the world will be interdependent and not dominated by one or two powers.   Kupchan believes the world is becoming more politically and ideologically diverse. The emerging nations are following their own path to modernity and embracing their own conceptions of domestic and international order.   However, Robert Kagen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues in his latest book, The World America Made, that if the US were to commit ""pre-emptive superpower suicide"", there would be war among rising nations as they fought for power, the retreat of democracy around the world and the weakening of the global free-market economy, which the US created and has supported for more than 60 years.   It is true that the US has been the world superpower for decades and in many ways played a positive role. But that does not mean such power is not abused from time to time, such as in the case of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the continuation of the half-a-century embargo on Cuba.   And in this sense, the rise of other nations would help check the excessive influence wielded by the only superpower.   The US will remain as a major power in this multi-polar world. Its decline is likely to be relative.   Yet, the rise of developing nations means that hundreds of millions of people from Asia, Africa and Latin America are being lifted out of poverty - a great achievement for humanity - and have a greater voice in international affairs. And in this context, the relative decline of the US helps build a more balanced and perhaps more harmonious world, worth celebrating even by Americans.

No foul words in public discourse,2/24/2012,"                              ESPN, a sports channel in the United States, blundered last week by using a derogatory word in a headline to describe New York Knicks star Jeremy Lin after the team lost to the New Orleans Hornets last Friday.   The action drew strong protests from Chinese and Asian Americans. ESPN removed the headline from its website less than 40 minutes after it was posted. It also issued an apology, fired the headline writer and suspended the anchor for 30 days.   I applaud ESPN's swift and appropriate response, though like Lin, I like to believe that the headline was unintentional.   Keeping the news media free from racial slurs and foul language is important for any society.   However, the frequent use of such words by Peking University professor and TV commentator Kong Qingdong is setting a negative example. Kong, who claims to be a 73rd-generation descendant of Confucius, uses profanity in his program to attack people he dislikes or disagrees with, both inside and outside China.   Despite strong public protests, we have never heard any apology from Kong, the university where he teaches, or the TV station where he works as a commentator.   Instead Kong either defends his argument or tries to claim he got carried away, such as in the case last month when he triggered an outpouring of protests from Hong Kong residents after he called them ""dogs and not people"".   While Kong's bad mouth and obduracy is a tragedy, what's even more disheartening is the widespread support he receives.   Many of his supporters and sympathizers argue that freedom of speech means that Kong should be allowed to say whatever he wants and that his coarse language serves to reinforce his argument, rather than weaken it.   But this is not true. On the contrary, the vulgar words he uses on his TV program or in his blogs have immediately estranged many people like me as well as many Peking University students who protested and demanded his resignation. This is despite the fact that some of his arguments may make sense.   I am not sure if Kong does this deliberately in a bid to boost his ratings. But as a professor, he should know that the foul language he uses in his TV program would not be tolerated in any debates on university campuses, both in China and other countries.   Many universities in the United States have a speech code which bans coarse words. In fact, some talks given by Kong could even be accused of encouraging prejudice and inciting hatred. Such speech is subject to legal punishment in many countries.   Yale University management professor Zhiwu Chen, also a vocal speaker in the Chinese news media, has lamented that the support for Kong is ""victory of a rogue culture"".   I cannot imagine what our society will be like if we continue to condone such foul language and intolerance in our public discourse.   But I do know that such a country would be far astray from the ancient Chinese civilization we are proud of, or the harmonious society we are trying to build.

Cultural differences can be hard to fathom,2/17/2012,"                                 Republican presidential hopeful of the United States, Mitt Romney, last week revealed his ignorance of the reality in China. Romney said that on Day One he ""will cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund which supports China's barbaric one-child policy"".   Romney may never have that Day One, but watching the escalating wars on birth control, abortion, gays and sex, I started to wonder if the US is still a progressive country.   If you talk to Chinese citizens, you will find that the vast majority support family planning as a national policy. The population pressure is real in a country where 1.37 billion people, four times the US population, crowd in a land only slightly bigger than the United States, but with far larger uninhabited areas of deserts and ice-topped mountains.   To most Chinese citizens, family planning is not just necessary; it is a must. Such a policy is also helpful to the rest of the world as the population on the planet exceeds 7 billion.   That said, China's family planning policy, which started in the late 1970s, has by no means been perfect, especially in the early years. Some local governments were too harsh in carrying out the policy and the subsequent demographics an aging population, gender inequality and many one-child families has resulted in some social problems.   However, this does not mean that China should discard the policy. It only means the policy needs to be adjusted to suit the times.   Many Westerners label China's family planning policy a ""one-child policy"", but this is not really accurate. All the local legislatures have passed laws to allow two children for couples who are the only child in their families. Ethnic groups have always enjoyed a privilege in the regard, as they can have two or more children.   Meanwhile, on the other side of the Pacific, a Pew Research Center poll last August indicated that only 52 percent of Americans believe in human evolution. About 10 days ago, the board of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the world's largest breast cancer charity, voted to defund the women's health organization Planned Parenthood as they were concerned that the money might be used to finance abortions.   A Wall Street Journal article on Wednesday called Obama's birth-control mandate unconstitutional and illegal. Latest news reports suggest that religious groups are planning to press Obama harder on such issues.   While I am appalled by the ideological, religious and conservative nature of the politics being espoused by candidates in the run-up to the election, historian Nancy Cohen reassured me in a conversation on Wednesday that the US is still a progressive country.   Cohen's new book: Delirium: How The Sexual Counterrevolution Is Polarizing America, explains how a shadow movement led by an extreme but political savvy minority has been exerting an excessive influence in US politics since the 1970s.   While criticizing the Republicans for their efforts to outlaw abortion, ban gay marriages and enforce traditional family values, Cohen is also disappointed with the Democrats who are afraid that being culturally progressive might cost them voters in elections. She hopes Obama will eventually stand up more forcefully on such issues.   The sexual fundamentalists, as Cohen calls this minority group, does not represent the majority of Americans. It seems that understanding US politics is as hard for us as it is for Americans to understand China's family planning policy.   To me, the family planning policy makes sense, but the sexual counterrevolution Cohen describes in her book does not.   The author, based in New York, is Deputy Editor of China Daily US edition.

Revealing tale of two Washingtons,2/10/2012,"                        During my two trips to Seattle, Washington, I was often reminded by local government officials and business leaders that this Washington is not ""the other Washington"".   By saying the other Washington, they meant Washington D.C., home to the White House, Capitol Hill and numerous federal government buildings.   The desire to distance themselves from the Washington that is home to the US political institutions is not surprising if you consider that the public approval rating for the US Congress hit a record low of 9 percent last October according to a New York Times poll. The result of a Gallup poll released on Wednesday looks equally dismal at 10 percent, down from 13 percent in January. The 17 percent average rating for 2011 is also the lowest yearly average rating for the Congress recorded by Gallup.   Americans increasingly use the word ""dysfunctional"" to describe the deep divide between the Democrats and Republicans in Congress as well as the contention between the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and the White House.   In the tug-of-war between the parties, nothing seems to get done. This will be especially true this year as the two parties are drumming up support for the presidential election.   There will be numerous negative political advertisements in the coming months as Republican presidential candidates attack each other in their bid to secure the nomination. And whoever the Republican nominee is, he will then engage in another round of crossfire with President Barack Obama.   As I walked into a building on K Street in Washington on Thursday to meet a once important political figure, I could feel why everything in this city is so politically charged and ideologically tinged.   In the other Washington on the Pacific Northwest, the mood is different. Governor Chris Gregoire is more pragmatic and down-to-earth in welcoming foreign investors and boosting trade. China has become the largest export market for the state.   I have found a similar down-to-earth attitude among other local leaders I have met over the past two years. During a time of financial crisis and high unemployment, they are eager to create jobs and they have no time to waste in the kind of ideological battle going on in Washington D.C.   In the state of Iowa, which Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping will visit next week, Governor Terry Branstad is just as pragmatic. He told reporters this week that he intends to talk trade with Xi, who is paying a return visit to Muscatine, a small town he visited in 1985 as Party secretary of Zhengding county of Hebei province. In that year, Branstad was also the governor.   Like many US states, Iowa has benefited enormously from its trade with China. Its exports to China exploded by almost 1,300 percent in the decade from 2000 to 2010. Branstad himself led an Iowa trade mission to China to promote ties in September.   While talks with President Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and other US leaders in Washington are important to bilateral relations, the local visits will be no less significant, because it will help the American public to understand China better and vice versa.   Watching the daily political dramas coming from Washington D.C. is often like watching a reality TV series. It is the Washington state, which borders Canada and which has many national forests and national parks such as the Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens, that is closer to real America.

Path of cooperation over confrontation,1/13/2012,"                                For the past week, I have seen Americans painting starkly different blueprints for relations between China and the United States.   On the one hand, Maurice Greenberg, chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr & Co, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, that it is time for a China-US Free Trade Agreement.   Greenberg admitted that such talks would not be easy and there would be numerous impasses, but that even if the two countries failed to reach an agreement on many issues, progress would be possible on some of the issues and that would create a better trade climate. He said that although negotiations may take up to 10 years, just attempting to reach an agreement would have major benefits, such as encouraging Chinese direct investment in modernizing infrastructure in the US.   ""China does not have to invest here, but it is to our country's advantage to have China invest here rather than in other countries,"" he wrote.   What Greenberg proposes is a path for strengthened cooperation between the two largest and complementary economies in the world. Despite their differences, China and the US must work together in the 21st century and that will be a big boon not just for people in China and the US, but people all over the world.   On the other hand, the message a week ago from US President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to accompany the new strategic review was quite disturbing. China has been singled out, along with Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as a potential adversary as the US starts to shift its military focus eastwards to the Asia-Pacific region.   Without doubt this is great news for the industries that supply the US military, as fear-mongering about China will ensure the monstrous US military remains a cash cow. Even Obama admitted that despite the $450 billion cuts in US defense spending over the next decade, the defense budget will continue to grow and be larger than the next 10 countries combined.   Fortunately, US experts, such as former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, General Stephen Cheney and Joshua Foust of the American Security Project, have reminded people that the prospect of a major conflict with China is remote and assuming one poses the danger of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.   Long-time US Congressman Barney Frank has dismissed the idea that China might block the South China Sea by saying that China's economic prosperity depends on the free navigation in South China Sea as much as anyone else.   I don't think many Chinese have ever thought about military confrontation with the US. This is not just because US military superiority leaves China far behind. More importantly, any armed conflict would be disastrous for China, a nation which desperately needs peace and stability to develop its trade and economy.   It seems that the one-week-old US strategic review should be reviewed again in order to correct its wrong and dangerous message.

Presidential hopefuls rely on showbiz,1/6/2012,"                           Observing the race among the Republican presidential candidates, which peaked at the Iowa Caucuses on Tuesday, it is hard to escape the fact that so far there has been way too much showbiz and not enough substance.   TV stations which host the debates between the candidates treat them like reality TV. Jon Huntsman, the candidate who I believe is the most serious and whose policies make the most sense, clearly has not mastered the showbiz arts. This is probably why in the November Michigan debate, the former US ambassador to China was given only 30 seconds by CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo to talk about China - his sound bite was simply not entertaining and crazy enough.   That is also probably why when Huntsman and Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, chose to sit down in New Hampshire in December for a more in-depth discussion, the media did not pay as much attention as they should, because the words were not outrageous enough.   In regard to performing skills, Mitt Romney, who came out narrowly on top in Iowa this week, has the edge. The former Massachusetts governor is willing to say whatever pleases the Republican voters. He has changed his views from supporting abortion to opposing it, and from acknowledging a human factor to climate change to pretending not to know the cause.   In fact, if you listen to speeches by the candidates, often you don't know what they are proposing as solutions to the key problems facing the United States, such as creating jobs and reducing deficits. Instead much of their time is devoted to attacking their rivals.   Attacking opponents has become the major weapon in such presidential campaigns. About $3.7 million was spent on negative ads in Iowa through Dec 30, according to data from Kantar Media, a New York-based company.   While it is okay and often necessary to point out the faults of other candidates, the problem with such negative ads is they are often not based on facts. There is plenty of fear mongering and rumors are repeated ad nauseam to mislead voters.   In one ad from Texas Governor Rick Perry aired on national cable TV, Perry looks directly into the camera and says: ""Obama's socialist politics are bankrupting America. We must stop him now.""   To be fair, Obama, who has raised more funds than any of the Republican candidates so far, is not adverse to using such negative ads himself, and such attacks will no doubt escalate when a GOP nominee is selected in the coming months.   But since electing the president is important not only for Americans, but also for rest of the world, surely the candidates should dignify the importance of the job opportunity with a little more seriousness and substance.   Hopefully, as the Republican primary moves to New Hampshire next week we will begin to see less hammy theatricals and more politics at a time when the US is suffering from a dearth of ideas and actions, not a deficit of entertainment.

Strikes against Syria unwarranted,4/27/2018,"                          The Scientific Research Center in the Barzeh neigborhood northeast of Damascus, after Saturday's missile strikes by the US, the UK and France. [Photo/Xinhua]   Since the outbreak of the ""Arab Spring"" seven years ago, much has changed in the political and security landscape in the Middle East. What has not changed is the fact that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains persona non grata for the United States and its allies.  On April 14, the US, Britain and France launched dozens of missiles on Syrian targets to ""punish"" Assad for the alleged use of chemical weapons in Douma, the last rebel-held town. There should be zero-tolerance for the use of chemical weapons. However, such unilateral moves, without any evidence of wrongdoing, will neither help the US and its allies achieve their aim of ousting Assad from power or increase the US' influence in the region. Instead, they will only increase the sufferings of the Syrian people and prevent the building of a just and equitable international order.  Syria is an independent country, and its sovereignty should be respected. Given the absence of solid evidence showing chemical weapons were actually used by Assad's force, the US-led military action, which was conducted without a mandate from the United Nations Security Council, was pernicious to the norms governing international relations and against the spirit of the UN Charter.  Despite their attempt to claim the moral high ground, the allies' autocratic military action not only further exacerbated the grievances of the Syrian people, it also dealt a heavy blow to the peace process. This explains why members of the international community have expressed deep disappointment over the strikes.  This is, however, not the first time the US and its allies have circumvented the UN and used force against a sovereign state. In 2003, the US bypassed the UN Security Council and invaded Iraq claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction-a claim that was pure fiction.  Nor is this the first time that Syria has been targeted using the same excuse. Last year, the US bombed a Syrian military base alleging that Assad's forces had used nerve gas that killed civilians in Idlib. On that occasion US and its allies used the same tactic of ""striking first"" and ""investigating and proving later"". These actions demonstrate the strategic aim of the US in Syria remains the same: toppling the Assad government, propping up the falling rebel forces in Syria and ending the influence of Russia and Iran in the country.  While the Syrian rebels were still in control of some areas as the fight against the Islamic State terrorists had engrossed much of the energy and attention of the pro-Assad forces last year, the rebels now find it increasingly difficult to counter Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran, after the IS lost its strongholds in Syria earlier this year.  While the international investigation into the alleged chemical weapons attack is still under way, the US needs to reflect on its policy in the Middle East.  Unless US President Donald Trump wants to get more deeply involved in the region, US airstrikes are not likely to cause any radical change in the status quo of Syria, let alone help the US achieve its strategic goals there.  Syria is still mired in war and chaos. In recent years, international attempts to ease the Syrian crisis have all failed miserably. Whenever a ray of hope emerged, it was obliterated by those determined to fulfill their interests in the country.  Those who claim to have a stake in the issue should realize that any reckless moves will only aggravate the crisis and dampen international efforts to defuse the crisis and restore peaced and order in the country through political means.

Trump will realize folly after tasting bitter fruit of the seed he has sown,4/12/2018,"                          A file photo of US President Donald Trump [Photo/Agencies]   In recent years, some observers have been hyping up the possibility of a head-on confrontation between China and the United States. With the shadow of a trade war growing darker and the tensions between the two countries in the South China Sea escalating, these observers believe their prediction is about to come true.  After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2016, a trade war between the world's largest and second-largest economies seemed likely. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has been brazenly pushing ahead his ""America First"" policy, by finding faults with almost all bilateral and multilateral trade deals that previous US administrations entered into, and ultimately pulling out of them.  On April 5, the Trump administration threatened to slap tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese imports. The move came just days after the US Trade Representative proposed to levy additional 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods.  In response to the US move, China was forced to adopt countermeasures. But considering the interdependence of the two economies and their significance to global trade, if a full-fledged trade war does break out, neither side will emerge a winner.  Admittedly, Beijing and Washington have tried to avoid such a bitter scenario. Last year, negotiators found some useful ways to reduce the US' trade deficit, such as allowing the export of US beef to China. However, Trump's unilateral moves show patience is not his forte-he cannot wait for such efforts to yield the desired results.  In this era of globalization, trade deficit is a complicated issue resulting from both external and internal factors. And history tells us the best way to resolve disputes over trade deficits is through dialogue and negotiation.  China-US relations, including bilateral trade ties, are the result of the willingness and incessant efforts of both sides to negotiate. But now that the Trump administration is desperate to ignite an all-out trade war with China, a full-blown confrontation between the US and China, as the reigning superpower and a rising power, appears imminent.  Yet it seems trade is not the only area in which the Trump administration intends to pick a fight with China. Apparently, the US military has increased the frequency of the so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, a practice that China sees as a blatant threat to its maritime territorial interests.  Last week, the US Navy's USS Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the South China Sea and, according to media reports, two other US aircraft strike groups, too, have entered China's surrounding waters. The large presence of the US navy coincides with the ongoing combat exercises staged by the People's Liberation Army Navy in the South China Sea, and the participation of PLA Navy's CNS Liaoning aircraft carrier has even aroused concerns over a possible China-US aircraft carrier face-off in the sensitive waters.  These developments show that tensions between the world's two largest economies have risen to an unusually high level. To a great extent, the Trump administration's outdated protectionist policies and its perception of China as a rival, instead of a competitive partner, have widened the trust deficit between the two sides. Still, there are no signs of Trump realizing the volatile atmosphere he has created.  As you sow, so shall you reap, goes a Chinese saying. It is likely therefore that the US will realize that protectionism and confrontation cannot ""make America great again"" after swallowing the bitter fruit of the seed it has sowed, especially because China has made it clear it will not back off from a US-orchestrated trade war.

Protectionism out of step with the times,3/15/2018,"                          Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]   The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, signed by 11 countries on either side of the Pacific Ocean in Santiago, Chile, on March 8, is widely believed to be an antidote to US protectionism. At the least, it is a timely wake-up call to US President Donald Trump that his ""America First"" policy is not only becoming increasingly unpopular but also making the United States lose benefits rather than increasing them.  The CPTPP agreement, a multilateral free trade deal among the signatories to the original Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement excluding the United States, is one of the largest free trade agreements in the world, and demonstrates the participating countries' commitment to trade liberalization, which may offer a strong bulwark against the rising trend of anti-globalization and protectionism in some countries.  Considering the original TPP deal was initiated and painstakingly pursued by former US president Barack Obama only to be abandoned by Trump when he took office, the decision of the other 11 countries, including US allies Japan, Canada and Australia, to revive it can be interpreted as a sign of the US' waning leadership.  A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based independent think tank, estimates the US, instead of gaining $131 billion under the TPP agreement, stands to lose $2 billion under the CPTPP deal. In contrast, each of the 11 CPTPP member countries can expect an average additional growth of about 1 percent in their respective national income by 2030, the study says.  As such, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP agreement runs counter to his stated aim of making ""America great again"".  Even without the US, the significance of the new trade pact in boosting free trade and multilateralism has been enhanced. The CPTPP, or TPP-11 as it is also known, comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It covers 500 million people on either side of the Pacific and represents nearly 13.5 percent of global gross domestic product.  Given Trump's open dislike for multilateral trade deals, the US has made an abrupt turn from being a champion of free trade. In a January article, The New York Times lamented that the US is lagging behind Europe and countries such as Japan and China in forging ahead with trade deals. Of the 35 new bilateral and regional trade pacts under consideration around the world, the US is party to just one of them, with the European Union-and even negotiations on that one have gone dormant.  To a great extent, Trump's trade protectionism stems from his stated belief that relations among countries are zero-sum games in which there are only winners and losers. This Cold War mentality is outdated; it does not conform to the trend of the times whose defining themes are peace and development. It is also an open defiance of the international efforts and consensus on promoting cooperation.  As the International Monetary Fund has stated, history shows that the myopic pursuit of zero-sum policies ends up hurting all countries. In contrast, experience shows the global economy works far better for all when policymakers engage in dialogue and abide by bilateral and multilateral rules and deals.  As a Chinese saying goes, enjoying happiness alone is not as enjoyable as sharing it with others. It is high time that Trump abandoned his myopic protectionist view, and came to terms with multilateralism and international cooperation.  Otherwise, the irony of the TPP-a trade pact originally conceived by the US to counter China's growing economic might in Asia, which is now being counted on to counter US protectionism-could be repeated elsewhere in the future.

New TPP deal is a blow to US trade protectionism,3/7/2018,"                      In an apparent effort to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact after the United States’ withdrawal a year ago, the remaining 11 states are expected to sign a revamped trade deal on Thursday. Although the significance of the new deal, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, is much diminished now it only represents 13.5 percent of the global GDP, compared with the previous 40 percent with the involvement of the US, the symbolic importance of the CPTPP has been bolstered as countries around the world feel an increasing urgency to cope with the US protectionism as well as the strong backlash that has emerged against globalization. That the 11 Pacific Rim countries are committed to finalizing the multilateral trade deal should be seen as confidence-building as it demonstrates their commitment to trade and international cooperation. To counter the protectionist moves of the world’s largest economy requires greater consensus and a shared political will among other countries to strive for shared growth through deepened cooperation in global trade and economic development. Obviously, such a formidable task cannot be achieved by a trade deal among 11 nations only. The world needs more inclusive multilateral trade deals, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, to champion the spirit of free trade and resurrect the trend of globalization. With the new TPP taking shape, negotiations on the 16-member RCEP, which involves members of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations and its regional trade partners including China, Australia, India and Japan, should be accelerated. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region should join hands in promoting the RCEP process, as well as work together to realize the even more ambitious Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, which theoretically includes all countries in the region. Advancing regional economic integration is a concrete way to ensure that openness and inclusiveness prevail in the region to the benefit of all.         "
New US nuke policy could spark fresh weapons race,2/1/2018,"                      It seems US President Donald Trump is unshakable in his determination to nullify the legacies of his predecessor Barack Obama. After the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and the 2015 Paris climate accord, another Obama legacy with global significance-his push for a ""nuclear-free world""-also looks shaky. Though the Trump administration is scheduled to unveil its nuclear strategy in February, the draft of the new Nuclear Posture Review, which was leaked to the US media last month, has already generated waves, sending an unmistakable message to the outside world that the United States, instead of reducing the role of its nuclear deterrence, will seek to expand its nuclear capabilities. In his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump made no attempt to hide this strategic intention, declaring that the US needs unmatched military power and must modernize and rebuild its nuclear arsenal. According to the draft nuclear review, the US will seek to expand ""flexible US nuclear options"", including ""low-yield options"", which are ""important for the preservation and credible deterrence against regional aggression"". The logic behind the US decision to develop low-yield nuclear weapons may stem from the thinking that the current stockpile of US nuclear weapons is too big and too deadly to use, so it needs smaller ones to strengthen its nuclear deterrence. However, this line of thinking is dangerous as it could lead to the opposite in reality: Instead of freeing the world from the threat of nuclear weapons, the US will add to the probability of a nuclear war in the future. In contrast to the draft report's insistence that ""it will raise the nuclear threshold and ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation, making nuclear employment less likely"", some international observers have rightfully argued that the US pursuit of a new batch of smaller, low-yield nuclear warheads will lower the threshold on the use and deployment of nuclear forces. The draft report's discussion on increased uncertainty and risk from a range of threats, including chemical, biological, nuclear, space and cyber threats, also suggests the US may use its smaller, low-yield nuclear warheads to address these new security challenges in the future. If such a scenario emerges, it will change the unwritten rule on the use of nuclear weapons as the last resort and, thus, lead to disastrous consequences that even the US could not bear. Since the end of World War II, the threat of mutual destruction by nuclear weapons, meaning the use of such weapons by one nuclear state against another would risk annihilating both, has prevented nuclear states from using such weapons. But Trump's new nuclear policy seems set to change this unwritten rule and make a nuclear war more probable. If the reports are true, the new US nuclear policy should set alarm bells ringing across the world, because it not only marks a major departure from the one advocated by Obama but also signals a retrogression in the global push for nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. Apart from raising fears of a nuclear war, the new US nuclear policy will inevitably throw the global nuclear equilibrium off balance and trigger a new US-led nuclear arms race. Shortly after the US report was leaked, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his country's nuclear stockpile should be given a high-tech overhaul, suggesting the proportion of state-of-the-art weapons in Russia's nuclear arsenal be raised to at least 90 percent by 2021. Indeed, the new US nuclear policy could become a signpost for recognized nuclear powers and the so-called nuclear threshold states to re-adjust their own nuclear strategies. In the face of the US expanding its nuclear capabilities, some states may seek to bolster their own capabilities and revamp their nuclear stockpiles. If the US insists on lowering the nuclear threshold, it will lay bare its intention of bolstering its military supremacy, setting a bad example for other countries, especially for those with nuclear ambitions. And the international community will find it more difficult to stop countries such the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from pursing their dangerous nuclear programs.

US suspension of Pakistan aid not good for 'war on terror',1/17/2018,"                          US President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, Sept 19, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]   The United States' decision to suspend security assistance to Pakistan has dealt a heavy blow to the already deteriorating relationship between Washington and Islamabad. It will also cast a shadow on US efforts to combat terrorism in Afghanistan, as Pakistan plays a pivotal role in the anti-terrorism campaign in the region.  Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies& deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.""  Days after this controversial tweet, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that Washington will withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan. Media reports suggest the US decision risks the suspension of $2 billion in aid to Pakistan.  In response, Pakistan suspended its defense and intelligence cooperation with the US amid rising domestic protests against Washington's ""betrayal"". The latest US action has plunged US-Pakistani ties to its lowest ebb as the military alliance between the two sides, forged after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US, has practically ceased to function.  After 9/11, Pakistan severed its ties with the Taliban and joined the US in the fight against terrorism. Pakistani cooperation enabled the US to topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and also helped restore the military alliance between Washington and Islamabad.  However, the US' military alliance with Pakistan has never been plain sailing. While the US suspected Pakistan's commitment and sincerity in fighting the Taliban, Islamabad was unhappy with the US drone attacks in Pakistan on targets the US claimed were used by terrorists to launch cross-border attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan deemed the attacks on its territory as a violation of its sovereignty.  The truth is that Washington has never treated Islamabad as an equal and respected ally despite Islamabad hunting down hundreds of terrorists with the limited resources at its disposal and paying a heavy price for aligning with the US. Its intelligence sharing has also helped the US troops to hunt down the top leaders of terrorist groups, including Osama bin Laden.  Even though Trump's predecessor Barack Obama decided to end the Afghanistan war in 2014 and withdraw most of the US combat troops from the country claiming the situation there had ""improved"", the security outlook in both Afghanistan and Pakistan has remained as bleak as ever. And with the reconciliation process in Afghanistan being full of twists and turns, Pakistan has continued to suffer frequent terrorist attacks.  Under such circumstances, the suspension of US security assistance to Pakistan could be interpreted as a waning of Washington's commitment to fight terrorism in the region. This might be in line with Trump's ""America First"" doctrine, but it could reinforce the widespread perception that the US is not acting like a responsible power in the region.  The US has the responsibility to clean up the mess it has created in Afghanistan. It should also help Pakistan contain its homegrown terrorists and those that have infiltrated the country from Afghanistan. For both missions, Washington needs strategic support from Islamabad as Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is a pivotal passageway and supply line for US troops still stationed in Afghanistan.  Unless the US is prepared to wage a lone battle against the remaining terrorists in Afghanistan and find other ways to support its troops there who rely on supplies through Pakistan, dissolving a military alliance with Pakistan built over the years is not a good bargain for the Trump administration.  From a geopolitical perspective, given the icy US-Pakistani ties, Islamabad will be forced to further deepen strategic relations with Beijing and Moscow, a scenario which Washington may not want to see. An estrangement, let alone a divorce, is thus not the best option for the US and Pakistan.  The author is a senior writer with China Daily. wanghui@chinadaily.com.cn         "
Trump will find thereis no quick fix to end war in Afghanistan,8/23/2017,"                             An Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier keeps watch at a checkpoint in Kabul, Afghanistan, August 22, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]    In a rare prime time national address outlining his Afghanistan strategy on Monday night, US President Donald Trump ruled out a quick withdrawal of US troops, saying that a rapid exit of the US troops would have unacceptable consequences and “create a vacuum” that the Islamic State and al-Qaida would fill.  Instead, Trump is expected to beef up the United States’ military presence in the country. Although Trump stopped short of mentioning a number, he authorized US Defense Secretary James Mattis in June to deploy as many as 3,900 extra troops.  Currently, the US has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, part of an international force that is roughly 13,500 strong that is training and assisting Afghan forces to fight the Taliban, and conduct counter-terrorism missions. But, even with the proposed increase in US troops, the Taliban is unlikely to be contained, let alone rooted out.  Yet compared with what the US has done to fight terrorists in the Middle East in recent years, the new US strategy does represent a greater willingness to shoulder more security responsibilities in Afghanistan. Military aid and airstrikes, but no ground troops, marked the previous US administration’s strategy in the Middle East, with Barack Obama unwilling to maintain a military presence in the region.  Despite that, much headway has been made this year in the international campaign against the Islamic State terrorists in both Iraq and Syria. Under such a backdrop, a greater US presence in Afghanistan will help Afghanistan forces improve the country’s security situation and prevent defeated IS terrorists from entering into the country and colluding with the Taliban.  However, since Trump asserted, “We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists”, his Afghanistan strategy obviously lacks a long-term commitment to the Central Asian country. Many in Afghanistan and elsewhere are justified to feel disappointed about it as the US has a responsibility to clean up the mess it has created in Afghanistan.  Despite the fact that George W. Bush claimed “mission accomplished” two years after he unleashed the Afghan war against the Taliban in Oct 7, 2001, and Obama announced an end of the war and the US withdrawal at the end of 2014, the war in Afghanistan has never come to an end.  The country’s security situation has continued to worsen after Obama withdrew the majority of the US forces. Now, hardly a day has passes without civilian casualties in Taliban instigated attacks, and the country has set one record after another in humanitarian disasters over the past few years.  For the US, its longest war has been fought at a formidable price: Some 2,400 Americans have died in the war, more than 20,000 have been wounded and the conflict is estimated to have cost almost $1 trillion  Yet, despite the toppling of the Taliban regime in late 2001, the US and its allies have spent most part of the 16-year-old war playing cat and mouse games with the Taliban. And, more ironically, over the years the land controlled by the terrorist group in Afghanistan has increased instead of being diminished.  As such, dispatching a further several thousand troops to Afghanistan will not be enough to end the conflict in the country once and for all. Instead, the US should learn the lessons from Iraq.  After the US invaded and toppled Saddam Hussein, its withdrawal left a political and security vacuum in the country. Political instability and factional rifts in post-war Iraq provided a hotbed for the rapid growth of the IS group, which later spread into Syria, and inspired terrorist attacks elsewhere.  The US should understand no country alone can tackle the challenge of terrorism. Before it plunges deeper into another Afghanistan quagmire, the US should truly reflect upon its anti-terror strategy and cooperate with other countries in jointly fighting terrorism.         "
US military ties with Taiwan will damage relations,7/28/2017,"                              US President Donald Trump attends a press conference at the White House in Washington DC, on April 12, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    That the US House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which has controversial provisions on Taiwan, suggests the Donald Trump administration is eager to leave its mark on Washington's policy toward Taiwan.  As one among a series of measures taken by the Trump administration, the bill passed on July 14 contains provisions about ""re-establishing"" regular ports of call for the United States Navy at Kaohsiung or any other suitable port in Taiwan, and permitting the US Pacific Command to receive Taiwan vessels. It also gives the green light to more US ""defense cooperation"" with Taiwan and ""normalizing"" US weapons sales to the island.  For obvious reasons, China has strongly opposed the bill, seeing it as a serious interference in its internal affairs and a blatant violation of the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués that guide Sino-US relations.  Under the three joint communiqués, the US is obliged to abide by the one-China policy, recognize that Taiwan is part of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China.  However, over the years the US has maintained unofficial contacts with the island and kept selling arms to it under the Taiwan Relations Act.  The latest US bill, if written into law, will set two troubling precedents for Washington's relations with Taiwan, and subsequently damage Sino-US relations. The port of call arrangement will, in effect, signal the beginning of direct military contacts between Washington and Taiwan and, along with the ""normalizing"" of US arms sales, amount to the US backpedaling on its official stance of phasing out arms sales to the island.  The US' national defense bill came into media spotlight one day after the Trump administration notified the US Congress of ""seven proposed defense sales for Taiwan"" worth $1.42 billion. Beijing has strongly criticized the Trump administration's first arms sales to the island, because it opposes any official or military exchange between Washington and Taiwan.  Considering that the Trump administration is still weighing the pros and cons of Sino-US ties, its intensified Taiwan-related moves show it is trying to play the Taiwan card, using it as leverage against Beijing to gain benefits in fields such as trade in return. That Trump, by nature, is a businessman and his credo is ""America First"" lend credence to this perception.  But the US should be warned that China brooks no interference in the Taiwan question, and any provocation over the issue will erode the mutual political trust between Washington and Beijing, even shake the foundation of Sino-US relations.  In the six months that Trump has been in the White House, China and the US have exchanged several high-level visits and held a series of talks.  The two countries reached important consensuses when President Xi Jinping and Trump met in Florida in April. They have implemented the 100-day economic plan, and decided to start a yearlong action plan for economic cooperation.  At the security level, the first China-US Diplomatic and Security Dialogue was held in Washington last month, which both sides said was constructive and fruitful. They have also made efforts to jointly address issues of common concern, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  But the US arms sales to Taiwan risk compromising the consensuses reached between the two sides and undermine their mutual efforts to deepen cooperation on both bilateral and multilateral fronts.  Given that the US Senate needs to vote on the Taiwan-related bill before Trump signs it into law, US politicians need to thoroughly reflect upon the harmful effects of those controversial provisions and do not aggravate the situation. After all, it will take the efforts of both sides to build on the good momentum of bilateral relations and chart a brighter future for Sino-US ties.

It's time Japan stopped dreaming TPP,7/22/2017,"                              Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]      Negotiators from the 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement held a meeting in Japan's hot-spring resort town of Hakone last week where they decided to push ahead with the agreement without any significant changes.  The two-day meeting shows some countries, especially Japan, are desperate to revive the TPP after US President Donald Trump pulled out of it in January. But, sooner or later, Japan will realize it has set out on mission impossible because without major revisions, the pact may remain good only on paper.  In its present state, the TPP agreement can come into force only after being ratified by at least six countries which together account for at least 85 percent of the bloc's GDP. Given that among the original members, the US alone accounts for more than 60 percent of the GDP, enforcing the TPP agreement without modifications is impossible.  But last week's meeting and the one among chief negotiators in Toronto, Canada, in May both stopped short of proposing major changes. Perhaps Japan believes that by effecting only minor changes it can still lure the US back into the TPP.  But since Trump still prefers bilateral trade deals and sticks to his ""America First"" credo, there is no reason to believe the US will make another U-turn.  Unlike Trump, however, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a penchant for multilateral trade arrangements. On July 6, Japan and the European Union announced they had reached consensus on a Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement. Abe called it ""a model for 21st century economic order"".  Considering that Japan has vowed to increase its exports under free trade deals to account for 70 percent of its overall export volume in 2018, Abe is also looking to the TPP and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, along with the outline free trade deal with the EU, to fulfill his economic goal.  However, compared with economic factors, political concerns play a larger role in Japan's endeavor to revive the TPP. In fact, political calculations in the TPP have far outweighed its economic objectives, as major economies such as China and India were deliberately kept out of it to enable the US to regain its waning global influence. And ever since China overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy in 2011, Tokyo's ambition to play a bigger role on regional and global platforms has grown by the day.  Given these facts, it is no surprise that Japan is desperate to use the TPP to widen its influence in the region, because once the TPP agreement comes into effect, Japan would be one step closer to achieving its goal of writing the global economic rules. Besides, considering the icy Beijing-Tokyo relations in recent years, Japan could also use the TPP card to contain China's economic influence in the region.  This also explains why Japan has been insisting the TPP agreement be used as a model for the RCEP, in total disregard of the huge differences in the economic levels of participating countries and the fact that the RCEP is a broader free trade arrangement covering more economies in the Asia-Pacific than the TPP.  Needless to say, Japan's stance has markedly slowed down the RCEP process. China has always supported inclusive and open multilateral economic arrangements, because the exclusiveness and overlapping nature of some existing multilateral trade mechanisms are to blame for imbalanced globalization.  As an advocate of balanced globalization, China has actively pushed for negotiations on the RCEP, which involves 16 countries including Japan. And as the world's third-largest economy, Japan needs to make the right choice and follow the trend of the times.  By refusing to change its confrontational mindset, Japan will lose (as well as make other countries lose) the opportunities presented by more inclusive regional economic arrangements such as the RCEP. It's time Japan woke up from its TPP dream.  The author is a senior writer with China Daily. wanghui@chinadaily.com.cn         "
Moon raises hopes of restoring peace on Peninsula,5/18/2017,"                              Moon Jae-in of the liberal Minjoo Party speaks during a celebration event in Seoul, South Korea, on May 9, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]      Controversies surrounding the installation of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in the Republic of Korea took a dramatic turn soon after Moon Jae-in was elected ROK president last week. On May 12, two days after the election result was declared, the ruling Minjoo Party said it will push for a parliamentary hearing on the illegal transportation and cost of the controversial deployment of the US anti-missile system on ROK soil, rekindling hopes that the decision made by the administration of the impeached and ousted former president Park Geun-hye could be reversed, or at least reviewed.  Moon had made it clear on his campaign trail that he did not support the deployment of THAAD in the ROK. A possible policy change on the issue, which is understandable for a country in political transition, can help it drop the political baggage left behind by Park, which has created a controversy both at home and abroad.  Since Park agreed last year to deploy the US anti-missile system, hardly has a day passed without ROK citizens criticizing the decision. On April 26, when part of the THAAD battery, including radar, was transported to a golf course in southeastern ROK, it ignited strong protests from local residents and peace activists.  Apparently, if Moon can put THAAD's deployment on hold, it would help bridge the existing social divide over the issue. On the diplomatic front, the move could also be seen as conciliatory by China.  While the United States and the ROK insisted that THAAD is intended to protect the ROK against possible missile attacks by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China was justified in lodging a strong protest against the move, as the THAAD radar, which has a potential radius of 2,000 kilometers, could also be used to spy on China, and thus undermines China's security interests.  As the US and the ROK insisted on going ahead with THAAD's deployment, China-ROK ties plummeted to almost their lowest level since the two countries forged formal diplomatic relations 25 years ago. This worrying trend cannot be allowed to further worsen as it would compromise the achievements made by the two neighbors because of their friendly and mutually beneficial ties.  Fortunately, Moon's election has presented a good opportunity to undo the damage caused by the ROK' s decision to deploy THAAD and put bilateral ties back on the right track.  President Xi Jinping was among the first world leaders to talk with Moon over the phone after his election victory. Xi said he hoped the new ROK government would attach great importance to the major concerns of China and take tangible actions for the healthy, stable development of bilateral ties.  The major concern of China apparently refers to the deployment of THAAD. In response Moon said the new ROK government will communicate with China over the issue and make efforts to seek a proper resolution to it. Following last week's conversation over the phone between the two leaders, bilateral communication and exchanges have improved. In fact, a ROK delegation, led by Park Byeong-seug, a veteran politician with close ties to Moon, attended the two-day Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing which concluded on Monday.  Xi met the delegation on the sidelines of the forum and told Park that friendly bilateral relations are very important for maintaining peace in the region and beyond.  Thanks to the positive exchanges between Beijing and Seoul, bilateral ties seem to be moving back on track, which is beneficial to both sides as well as the region and beyond. Continuously rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula shows the different sides are using military means to counter security threats, with THAAD being a prime case in point, which will only deepen hostility and shrink the space for diplomatic mediation. It is hoped the new ROK government will show political wisdom and correct the wrong decision of the previous government.

Winds of change in Manila bring welcome relief,5/12/2017,"                              Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (L) speaks during an interview with Xinhua News Agency in Manila, the Philippines, Oct 13, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]      The Philippines and the United States began their main annual military exercises on Monday on a low key and a limited scale. The 12-day ""Balikatan"", or ""shoulder to shoulder"", joint military drills could serve as a barometer of the decades-old alliance. Some media reports say the number of troops taking part in this year's drills is less than half that in 2015, and the focus is only on anti-terrorism and disaster-response operations-in sharp contrast to the drills held when Benigno Aquino III was the Philippine president.  The ""shoulder to shoulder"" war games, begun in 1991, have been held almost regularly except for the brief interruption between 1995 and 1999. In recent years, many observers saw the annual exercises as a strategic maneuvering of former US president Barack Obama to push forward his ""rebalancing to Asia"" strategy. The military drills even served Aquino III's ulterior motive of confronting China over the South China Sea disputes and using it as a pretext to strengthen the Philippines' maritime defense and combat capabilities. And the drills, as expected, raised tensions in the region as they were staged near disputed waters.  However, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sought to improve ties with China after taking office and play down the importance of his country's alliance with the United States. Duterte has also made some unfriendly remarks against the US, raising a lot of eyebrows in Washington and other Western capitals.  Yet the Donald Trump administration has been restrained in its response to Duterte's somewhat provocative rhetoric and instead has tried to shore it up as one of the most important alliances for the US in the Asia-Pacific region.  After Duterte announced in September that he would soon stop holding joint military drills, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, in an apparent response, said Washington's alliance with Manila remains ""ironclad"".  Although Trump is yet to reveal a policy to replace the ""rebalancing to Asia"" strategy, the US is unlikely to play down the importance of the Philippines in the Asia-Pacific as the latter will assume the rotating chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year. But it would be naïve of the US to still believe Manila will be happy to propel the US' strategic maneuvering in the region just like it did during Aquino III's tenure.  For its part, the Philippines under Duterte is unlikely to change its policy of gradually distancing itself from the US. That Washington and Manila, at their annual strategic meeting in November, agreed to scale back their joint exercises and reduce the number of US troops deployed in the Philippines is one example of Manila sticking to its course. Philippine officials said the scaled-down drills include an amphibious landing exercise and cooperation afloat readiness and training, both major naval exercises that include territorial defense training.  Although it might be too early to speculate the slow weakening of the US-Philippines alliance, one can safely say a light breeze of change is blowing, especially because the uncertainties that have emerged might not be bad for Manila and the South China Sea disputes. After all, the Philippines did not get any substantial gains for becoming a leading catalyst for the US' ""rebalancing to Asia"" strategy while suffering all the negative consequences of its soured relations with Beijing. Duterte realized this inequity before deciding to develop better relations with China. The Philippine president will visit China to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on May 14 and 15. His second visit to China since taking office in July shows his determination to deepen ties with China.  China-Philippines ties are back on the right track, and the two sides have signed an array of bilateral agreements of cooperation that will bring mutual benefit. And tensions in the South China Sea have defused as Manila gradually distances itself from Washington. Some times even a light breeze makes the wind chimes produce clear, melodious music.

THAAD can further complicate situation on Korean Peninsula,5/3/2017,"                              File photo shows Seoungju residents chant slogans during a protest against the government's decision on deploying a US THAAD anti-missile defense unit in Seongju, in Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2016. The banner reads ""Desperately oppose deploying THAAD"". [Photo/Agencies]      International observers were surprised to see the Democratic People's Republic of Korea celebrate its Army Day on April 25 without any act of provocation, such as a missile launch. Yet the brief tranquility on the Korean Peninsula was short-lived as the DPRK reportedly test-fired a ballistic missile four days later.  Though the missile exploded shortly after liftoff, it still constituted a blatant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions which forbid Pyongyang from taking such provocative actions. Given that Pyongyang has repeatedly resorted to acts of provocation and defied the international community's call to stop its ambitious nuclear and missile programs, its latest move deserves to be condemned by the international community in the strongest terms.  However, as tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to escalate and the rival parties threaten each other with war rhetoric, it is necessary to ponder how the situation has worsened so fast and why it has tightened into such a complicated knot that it is almost difficult to undo it now.  It takes two to quarrel. This fact applies perfectly to the peninsula situation. In fact, recent years have seen rival sides fall into a vicious circle of provocation and retaliation.  The United States, despite claiming to have lost its ""strategic patience"", has shown overall restraint by playing down its calls for military action against Pyongyang. It has also stepped up efforts to communicate and cooperate with China to defuse the situation, reflecting its better understanding of how to restore peace and stability on the peninsula.  However, on April 26 the US Air Force conducted an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile test with reportedly the DPRK as the imaginary enemy. It has also dispatched the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson toward the Korean Peninsula.  Pouring oil on fire, Washington and Seoul have also accelerated their efforts to deploy an advanced US missile defense system in the Republic of Korea despite strong opposition from Chinese and ROK citizens. On paper, the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is intended to protect the ROK from missile attacks from the DPRK, but its surveillance capability is also bound to undermine the security interests of other countries, including China's.  A growing number of people in the ROK believe THAAD will only make their country unsafe, and they have staged massive protests against its deployment. Cheong Wooksik, director of the ROK-based Peace Network, recently published a book, Everything about THAAD, in which he says his country could be the biggest victim of deploying THAAD on its soil.  As far as Pyongyang is concerned, it has interpreted these military maneuverings as provocations and threats to its security. And since the DPRK responded to such threats with an even bigger threat, its failed missile launch on Saturday was not surprising.  On Sunday, officials in Seoul said Washington had reaffirmed it would bear the cost of deploying THAAD on ROK soil after US President Donald Trump declared a few days ago that Seoul should pay $1 billion for the anti-missile system.  Analysts say Pyongyang's missile launch on Saturday may have prompted the US to make a U-turn on the cost issue, paving the way for completing the THAAD deployment between July and September, much earlier than the original schedule of the end of the year.  In fact, parts of the THAAD battery were installed last week, and ROK defense officials said it already has an initial operational capability.  With the ROK presidential election round the corner, the US may want to make the deployment of THAAD an established fact so that whoever wins the election will have little room to delay the installation, let alone cancel it.  Such political calculation is dangerous because it can further complicate the already complex and volatile situation on the peninsula, and once the situation goes out of control, no party can emerge as a winner.

Bilateral mechanism can help deepen trust with Australia,4/26/2017,"                              Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump (L) hold the second round of talks in the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the United States, April 7, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]    International relations experts more or less agree that while Barack Obama was the US president there was strategic mutual distrust between China and the United States largely because of the latter's strategic ""pivot"" to Asia strategy, which was actually intended at containing China's rise.    Yet fewer people seem to have realized that similar distrust has also marked the relationship between China and Australia from time to time. One proof of the distrust is that Canberra has almost always supported Washington in issues such as the South China Sea disputes, and the US' ""freedom of navigation"" operations near disputed waters and other major strategic maneuverings in the Asia-Pacific region.  On April 18, US Marines started arriving in Darwin in northern Australia on a six-month deployment program as part of the US ""pivot"" to Asia strategy. A Reuter report says that, although the 1,250 US troops in Australia comprise half of the 2,500 Marines to be gradually deployed there according to an agreement signed in 2011, Australia will see the largest deployment of US aircraft contingent in peacetime history.  Many see a stronger US military presence in Australia as serving the US' strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific and a major response to China's ""rising assertiveness"" in the region. And by jumping on the US bandwagon to contain China, Australia has fueled suspicions among its citizens about China.  Many Chinese still cannot understand why the ""China threat"" theory has been hyped from time to time in Australia, because being thousands of miles away from Australia, China cannot possibly pose any direct threat to the country. They also cannot fathom why Chinese investments have been under the most severe scrutiny in Australia despite Australian politicians repeatedly saying they welcome investors from China. This is all the more surprising because the two economies remain highly complementary, and trade with China is playing a significant role in boosting the Australian economy.  Such issues hindering the smooth development of China-Australia ties are largely the result of some Australians' distrust of China. Many have ascribed Australia's strategic distrust of China to the country's alliance with the US, which was forged after World War II.  In a clear sign that the US administration under Donald Trump intends to strengthen the alliance with Australia, US Vice-President Mike Pence, during his visit to Canberra, reiterated the US' ""enduring commitment"" to the alliance between the two countries.  Australians tend to believe the alliance with the US is vital to safeguarding Australia's security. Whether or not the decades-old alliance is still relevant and compatible with today's global trend, it should not block Australia's healthy interactions with China.  Fortunately, insightful people in Australia have begun to see Canberra's ties with Beijing differently. They believe Canberra needs to have a more independent foreign policy and forge a closer relationship with Beijing, as they see Australia's future development hinges more on its relations with China than with the US.  The first China-Australia high-level security dialogue was held in Sydney on Friday, with both sides pledging to boost cooperation in such fields as judicial and legal affairs, cyber security, and combating terrorism and transnational crimes.  And the new bilateral mechanism, agreed by Premier Li Keqiang and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during Li's visit to Australia in March, shows that the two sides are keen on deepening strategic mutual trust and bridging the gaps in regional and international security issues.  With efforts of such kind, it is believed Beijing and Canberra can gradually dispel their mutual distrust and differences, and forge a steady and stronger relationship, so as to realize more mutual benefits and jointly contribute to regional peace and development.

Iran nuke deal shows how to resolve DPRK issue,4/7/2017,"                              A surface-to-surface medium- and long-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2 is test-fired by DPRK on Jan 12, 2017. [Photo/VCG]      The Iranian nuclear deal, finalized between Teheran and six world powers on April 2, 2015, is two years old. While people's memories of the diplomatic triumph over what had become a dangerous nuclear issue are still fresh, the landmark deal now faces uncertainties because of the changing stance of the United States, which played an important role in making it reality.  US President Donald Trump, from his campaign trail days, has been saying he plans to ""dismantle"" the deal. And analysts say that even though he may not be able to scrap a multilateral deal, he can find ways to ""violate"" it, which in turn will make it difficult for the US to uphold it.  On March 23, Republican Senator Bob Corker submitted a bill titled Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which had received more than a dozen co-sponsors in just a few days. The bill could allow Trump to re-impose sanctions on Iran, including those set to expire under the Iranian nuclear deal by adding new conditions that must be met before Washington lifts the sanctions on certain Iranian parties.  Such a bill will no doubt anger Iran. Even some US media outlets have said such a move is tantamount to an open declaration of conflict with Iran. The Iranian nuclear deal, deemed one of the most important legacies of former US president Barack Obama, is the result of years of strenuous negotiations among the P5+1 countries (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the US plus Germany), the European Union and Iran.  During the course of the negotiations, all the participating parties demonstrated strong political will and spirit of diplomacy. The final round of talks alone spanned 20-plus months. And negating the result of such painstaking efforts could dim the hopes that similar gnawing issues the world faces today can be resolved peacefully.  The Iranian nuclear deal formally came into force in July 2015, and there is ample evidence to show Iran has been fulfilling its commitments and following the timetable to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure.  The Iranian nuclear deal raised the world's hopes that the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue can be resolved peacefully. But compared with the Iranian nuclear issue, the DPRK problem seems more complicated and volatile, and is becoming graver with each passing day. In its latest provocative move, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Wednesday, but even before that, Trump had warned that the US will act alone if China ""did not"" help resolve the issue.  Washington has apparently hardened its stance on Pyongyang since Trump took office. Last month, US officials said all options are on table, including military ones, triggering speculation that the White House is changing course on the DPRK issue.  The fact is, the US and the Republic of Korea have been following a policy of containment and retaliation-a vicious circle-against the DPRK. Complicating matters is Seoul's decision to deploy the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system on the ROK soil, which has driven China-ROK ties to its lowest point in years. Besides, the long-standing distrust between Pyongyang and Washington has prompted the former to view every military maneuver by the US and the ROK as a plot targeted against Pyongyang.  The situation on the peninsula has reached such a dangerous point that Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the two contesting sides as ""two accelerating trains heading toward each other with neither side willing to give way"". A collision between the ""trains"" will do neither party any good; instead, it will leave both licking their wounds and calculating the severe costs.  All parties therefore should exercise utmost restraint, as any misstep at this stage could lead to irreversible consequences. Exercising restraint and holding meaningful multilateral talks are the best ways to prevent the ""train"" collision and to work out a diplomatic solution to the problem.
